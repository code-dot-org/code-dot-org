# This migration was created to ensure consistent ordering of the id
# column in the cohorts_districts table in staging and production
# vs. test.  Although this column ordering difference is not very
# significant semantically, we want the environments to be as
# consistent as possible and the discrepancy was causing our schema
# dump consistency logic to throw an exception.
