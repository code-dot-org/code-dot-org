  # The top 6 subjects here are straight string changes for the names of
  # our academic year workshops.
  # The "Virtual Workshop #" workshops represent regional partners
  # who have scheduled these "Virtual Workshop #" workshops instead of
  # the more traditional "Academic Year Workshop #" workshops.
  # This migration moves those workshops to to the more traditional
  # workhop naming convention. These regional partners also likely have
  # "Virtual Workshop 2/4/6/8" scheduled - we are working
  # with this limited group to manually delete or
  # update these workshops, as appropriate.

  # Academic Year Workshops this school year, so in the case of a problem
  # with subject naming we'll leave the email suppression as-is.
  # It also will rename subjects originally named "Virtual Workshop #"
  # to "Workshop 1: Unit 3", which we think is ok in this situation.
