  def change
    # The AddForeignKeyForScriptToSection migration failed in production because it
    # takes too long to apply (roughly 4 minutes). This reverted it. As clean up we
    # are removing the content of this and the original migrations.
    # See https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org/pull/35088 for more details.
