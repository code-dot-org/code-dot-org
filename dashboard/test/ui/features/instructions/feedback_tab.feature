Feature: Feedback Tab Visibility

Background:
  Given I create a teacher-associated student named "Lillian"
  And I am on "http://studio.code.org/s/allthethings/stage/38/puzzle/1?noautoplay=true"
  Then I rotate to landscape
  And I wait to see "#runButton"
  And I press "runButton"
  And I wait to see "#finishButton"
  And I press "finishButton"

Scenario: As student with dev experiment on, 'Feedback' tab is not visible if no feedback
  #As student, with no feedback, can see Key Concept tab on rubric level
  And I am on "http://studio.code.org/s/allthethings/stage/38/puzzle/1?enableExperiments=2019-mini-rubric"
  And I wait to see ".uitest-feedback"
  And element ".editor-column" contains text "Key Concept"
  Then I click selector ".uitest-feedback"
  And I wait to see ".editor-column"
  And element ".editor-column" contains text "This is the key concept for this mini rubric."
  And element "#rubric-input-exceeds" does not exist
  And element "#ui-test-submit-feedback" does not exist
  And element "#ui-test-feedback-time" does not exist
  And element "ui-test-feedback-input" does not exist
  Then I sign out

@no_ie
# Disabling IE due to bug where text changes in the feedback text input are not registered
# so submit button remains disabled
Scenario: As teacher, when viewing a level with student work,
feedback can be submitted and displayed. If in experiment and there is a mini rubric, teacher can give feedback on rubric.
If a teacher in experiment on a level with mini rubric can see the rubric without viewing student work.
Otherwise don't show feedback tab
  Then I sign in as "Teacher_Lillian"
