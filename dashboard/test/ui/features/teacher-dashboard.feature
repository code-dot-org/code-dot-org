  Scenario: Eyes tests for section projects with thumbnails
    When I open my eyes to test "section projects with thumbnails"
    And I create a teacher-associated student named "Sally"

    # Create an applab project and generate a thumbnail

    When I am on "http://studio.code.org/projects/applab/new"
    And I wait for the page to fully load
    And I ensure droplet is in text mode
    And I append text to droplet "createCanvas('id', 320, 450);\nsetFillColor('red');\ncircle(160, 225, 160);"
    And I press "runButton"
    And I wait until element ".project_updated_at" contains text "Saved"
    And I wait until initial thumbnail capture is complete
    And I press "resetButton"
    And I click selector "#runButton" once I see it
    # Wait for the thumbnail URL to be sent to the server.
    And I wait until element ".project_updated_at" contains text "Saved"

    # Create a gamelab project and generate a thumbnail

    When I am on "http://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/new"
    And I wait for the page to fully load
    And I ensure droplet is in text mode
    And I append text to droplet "\nfill('orange');\nellipse(200,200,400,400);"
    And I press "runButton"
    And I wait until element ".project_updated_at" contains text "Saved"
    And I wait until initial thumbnail capture is complete
    And I press "resetButton"
    And I click selector "#runButton" once I see it
    # Wait for the thumbnail URL to be sent to the server.
    And I wait until element ".project_updated_at" contains text "Saved"

    # Create an artist project and generate a thumbnail.
    #
    # Ensure the predraw layer is included in the thumbnail, and that a project
    # with that thumbnail appears in the projects list, by running and then
    # remixing a project-backed script level which has a predraw layer.
    #
    # We can't simply share the script level, because that doesn't make it
    # show up in the projects list. We can't just run the remixed project to
    # generate the thumbnail, because it will have lost the predraw layer.
    # Whether losing the predraw layer on remix is ok is a different issue, and
    # until it is resolved we want to make sure thumbnails include predraw.

    When I am on "http://studio.code.org/s/allthethings/stage/3/puzzle/8"
    And I wait for the page to fully load
    And I press "runButton"
    And I wait until element ".project_updated_at" contains text "Saved"
    And I wait until initial thumbnail capture is complete
    And I press the first ".project_remix" element to load a new page
    And I wait for the page to fully load

    # Create a playlab project level and generate a thumbnail.

    # We don't want to have to write the code by dragging blocks, so just remix
    # an existing project-backed level, and then run the project.

    When I am on "http://studio.code.org/s/allthethings/stage/5/puzzle/5"
    And I wait for the page to fully load
    And I press the first ".project_remix" element to load a new page
    And I wait for the page to fully load
    And I press "runButton"
    And I wait until element ".project_updated_at" contains text "Saved"
    And I wait until initial thumbnail capture is complete
    And I press "resetButton"
    And I click selector "#runButton" once I see it
    # Wait for the thumbnail URL to be sent to the server.
    And I wait until element ".project_updated_at" contains text "Saved"

    And I sign out

    # Load the section projects page

    When I sign in as "Teacher_Sally"
    # Enable the showProjectThumbnails experiment on Pegasus for this test.
    Given I am on "http://code.org/teacher-dashboard?no_home_redirect=1&enableExperiments=showProjectThumbnails"
    Then I am on "http://studio.code.org/home"
    And I click selector "a:contains('New Section')" once I see it
    And I click selector "#learn-tabs a:contains('Projects')" once I see it
    And I wait until element "#projects-list" is visible

    And I wait until the image within element "tr:eq(3)" has loaded
    And I wait until the image within element "tr:eq(4)" has loaded

    Then I see no difference for "projects list view"
    And I close my eyes
