Feature: Modal Function Editor Eyes

Background:
  Given I am on "http://studio.code.org/s/allthethings/lessons/36/levels/3?noautoplay=true&blocklyVersion=google"
  And I wait for the page to fully load
  And I wait for 3 seconds
  And I wait until I don't see selector "#p5_loading"
  And I close the instructions overlay if it exists
  Then element "#runButton" is visible
  And element "#resetButton" is hidden

Scenario: Edit a Function
  When I open my eyes to test "edit a function"
  Then I click block field that is number 1 in the list of blocks and number 1 in the field row
  And element "#modalFunctionEditor" is visible
  # Open Sprites flyout
  And I press "blockly-d"
  # We need to drag and drop blockly blocks in two steps.
  And I drag and drop block "new-sprite-block" to offset 70, 177
  And I wait for 1 seconds
  And I drag and drop block "new-sprite-block" to offset -30, 0
  And I wait for 1 seconds
  And I see no difference for "add a new block to the function"
  # Close function
  And I press "closeModalFunctionEditor"
  And element "#modalFunctionEditor" is not visible
  And I press "runButton"
  And I wait for 3 seconds
  And I see no difference for "run the program with the updated function"
  And I close my eyes
