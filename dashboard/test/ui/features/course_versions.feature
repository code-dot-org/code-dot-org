Scenario: Version warning announcement on course and unit overview pages
  # course and unit pages do not show version warning initially

  When I am on "http://studio.code.org/courses/csp-2017"

  And element "#version-selector" is visible
  Then element ".announcement-notification:contains(right version)" does not exist

  When I am on "http://studio.code.org/s/csp2-2017"
  And I wait until element "span:contains(Chapter 1)" is visible
  And element "#version-selector" is not visible
  Then element ".announcement-notification:contains(right version)" does not exist

  # generate some progress in csp-2018

  Given I am on "http://studio.code.org/s/csp3-2018/next"
  And I wait until current URL contains "/s/csp3-2018/stage/1/puzzle/1"

  # course and unit pages now show version warning

  When I am on "http://studio.code.org/courses/csp-2017"
  And I wait to see ".uitest-CourseScript"
  And element "#version-selector" is visible

  # make sure we are showing the warning specific to course overview pages

Scenario: Course unit family names redirect to their latest stable version
  When I am on "http://studio.code.org/s/csp3"
  And I get redirected to "/s/csp3-2018" via "dashboard"

Scenario: Script levels in renamed scripts redirect to their original version
  When I am on "http://studio.code.org/s/csp3/stage/9/puzzle/11"
  # Keep redirecting to the original version of a script level after a later
  # script version becomes stable, because a user with a deep link to a specific
  # level will most likely expect to see their previous progress there.
