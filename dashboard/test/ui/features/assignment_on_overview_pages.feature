    When I click selector ".uitest-owned-sections a:contains('Computer Science Principles')" to load a new page
    Then the url contains the section id
    And check that the URL contains "courses/csp-2017"
    And I wait until element ".uitest-CourseScript" is visible
    And I wait until element ".uitest-unassign-button" is visible
    # One assign button for each of 8 currently unassigned units in this course.
    Then the overview page contains 8 assign buttons
    And I press the first ".uitest-unassign-button" element
    # One assign button for each of 9 currently unassigned units in this course,
    # and one at the top of the page indicating the course is assigned
