Feature: Blocks can be trashed in certain circumstances

Background:
  Given I am on "http://studio.code.org/s/course2/stage/19/puzzle/2"
  And I rotate to landscape
  And I wait for the page to fully load
  Then element "#runButton" is visible
  And element "#resetButton" is hidden
  # In this level's initial setup:
  And "when_run" refers to block "25"
  And "gray set_color" refers to block "26"
  And "turn_right" refers to block "31"

Scenario: Drag-delete a deletable block
  When I drag block "turn_right" to offset "-2000, 0"
  Then block "turn_right" has been deleted

Scenario: Fail to drag-delete an undeletable block
  When I drag block "gray set_color" to offset "-2000, 0"
  Then block "gray set_color" has not been deleted
  And block "turn_right" has not been deleted

Scenario: Fail to drag-delete a deleteable block that has an undeletable child
  When I drag block "turn_right" to block "when_run"
  Then block "turn_right" is child of block "when_run"
  Then block "gray set_color" is child of block "turn_right"
  When I drag block "turn_right" to offset "-2000, 0"
  Then block "turn_right" has not been deleted
  And block "gray set_color" has not been deleted

Scenario: Delete on drag off top-left
  When I drag block "turn_right" to offset "-2000, -2000"
  Then block "turn_right" has been deleted

Scenario: Delete on drag off left
  When I drag block "turn_right" to offset "-2000, 0"
  Then block "turn_right" has been deleted

Scenario: Delete on drag off bottom-left
  When I drag block "turn_right" to offset "-2000, 2000"
  Then block "turn_right" has been deleted

Scenario: Bump on drag off top
  When I drag block "turn_right" to offset "0, -2000"
  Then block "turn_right" has not been deleted
  And block "turn_right" is visible in the workspace

Scenario: Bump on drag off top-right
  When I drag block "turn_right" to offset "2000, -2000"
  Then block "turn_right" has not been deleted
  And block "turn_right" is visible in the workspace

Scenario: Bump on drag off right
  When I drag block "turn_right" to offset "2000, 0"
  Then block "turn_right" has not been deleted
  And block "turn_right" is visible in the workspace

  Scenario: Bump on drag off bottom-right
    When I drag block "turn_right" to offset "2000, 2000"
    Then block "turn_right" has not been deleted
    And block "turn_right" is visible in the workspace

Scenario: Bump on drag off bottom
  When I drag block "turn_right" to offset "0, 2000"
  Then block "turn_right" has not been deleted
