Feature: Feedback Tab Visibility

Background:
  Given I create a teacher-associated student named "Lillian"
  And I am on "http://studio.code.org/s/allthethings/stage/38/puzzle/1?noautoplay=true"
  Then I rotate to landscape
  And I wait to see "#runButton"
  And I press "runButton"
  And I wait to see "#finishButton"
  And I press "finishButton"

Scenario: As student with dev experiment on, 'Feedback' tab is not visible if no feedback
  #As student, see temporary text
  And I am on "http://studio.code.org/s/allthethings/stage/38/puzzle/1?enableExperiments=2019-mini-rubric"
  And element ".uitest-feedback" is not visible

  @no_ie
# Disabling IE due to bug where text changes in the feedback text input are not registered

# so submit button remains disabled
Scenario: As teacher with dev experiment on, when viewing a level with a mini rubric and student work,
feedback can be submitted and displayed. Otherwise don't show feedback tab
  Then I sign in as "Teacher_Lillian"

  #Not automatically visible on contained levels with no mini rubric
  Then I am on "http://studio.code.org/s/allthethings/stage/18/puzzle/15?enableExperiments=2019-mini-rubric"
  And element ".uitest-feedback" is not visible

  #Not automatically visible on un-contained levels with no mini rubric
  Then I am on "http://studio.code.org/s/allthethings/stage/18/puzzle/7"

  Then I click selector ".show-handle .fa-chevron-left"
  Then I click selector ".section-student .name a"
  And I press the first "#ui-test-feedback-input" element
  And element ".editor-column" contains text "This is the key concept for this mini rubric."
