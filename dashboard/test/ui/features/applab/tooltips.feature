  Scenario: Hovering over elements in design mode
    Given I open my eyes to test "tooltips in design mode"
    And I switch to design mode
    And I wait for 1 seconds

    When I hover over element with id "design_text_area1"
    And I save the project
    And I wait until element ".project_updated_at" contains text "Saved"
    Then I see no difference for "tooltip for text area"

    When I hover over the screen at xpos 300 and ypos 100

    And I close my eyes
