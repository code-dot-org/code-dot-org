Feature: Using the Level Edit Page

  Scenario: Update a Multi level
    Given I create a levelbuilder named "Levi"
    And I create a temp multi level
    And I check I am on the temp level edit page
    # The dsl on the level edit page gets loaded from the level dsl file. This
    # file won't have been updated in the test environment because level dsl
    # files are only written in levelbuilder mode, so we have to enter all
    # of the DSL text again.
    And I enter temp level multi dsl text
    And I click "input[type='submit']" to load a new page
    And I check I am on the temp level show page
    And element "body" contains text "incorrect answer"
    And I delete the temp level
