  Scenario: Teacher wants to disable AI rubrics
    Given I create a teacher named "Haplo"
    And I give user "Haplo" authorized teacher permission
    Given there is a pilot called "ai-rubrics"
    And I add the current user to the "ai-rubrics" pilot
    Given I am on "http://studio.code.org/users/edit"
    Then I wait to see "#user_ai_rubrics_disabled"
    And element "#user_ai_rubrics_disabled" is not checked
    And I press "#user_ai_rubrics_disabled" using jQuery
    And element "#user_ai_rubrics_disabled" is checked
    And I take note of the current loaded page
    And I press "#edit-ai-settings" using jQuery
    Then I wait until I am on a different page than I noted before
    Given I am on "http://studio.code.org/users/edit"
    Then I wait to see "#user_ai_rubrics_disabled"
    And element "#user_ai_rubrics_disabled" is checked
