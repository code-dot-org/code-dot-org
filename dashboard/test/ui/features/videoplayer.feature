Feature: The video fallback player works as expected

Background:
  Given I am on "http://learn.code.org/reset_session"

Scenario: Fallback player
  Given I am on "http://learn.code.org/flappy/1?force_youtube_fallback"
  When I rotate to landscape
  And I wait to see "#x-close"
  Then I see ".video-js"

@chrome
Scenario: Flash fallback player gets injected in Chrome (assuming Flash is available)
  Given I am on "http://learn.code.org/flappy/1?force_youtube_fallback"
  When I rotate to landscape
  And I wait to see "#x-close"
  Then I see ".video-js"
  Then I see jquery selector object[type='application/x-shockwave-flash']

# no_ie because YouTube's recent change to their player is causing our
#   fallback detection to get a false negative
# skip because SauceLabs is currently blocking YouTube content, causing
#   this to consistently fail. TODO @elijah: unskip when they update
@no_ie
@skip
@no_mobile
Scenario: Normal player
  Given I am on "http://learn.code.org/flappy/1"
  And I wait to see "#x-close"
  When I rotate to landscape
  Then I see "#video"
  Then I see the first Flappy YouTube video with the correct parameters
