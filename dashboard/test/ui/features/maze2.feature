Feature: Complete a simple maze level

  Background:
    Given I am on "http://studio.code.org/reset_session"
    Given I am on "http://studio.code.org/s/20-hour/stage/2/puzzle/11?noautoplay=true"
    And I rotate to landscape
    And I wait for the page to fully load
    And I close the instructions overlay if it exists
    Then element ".csf-top-instructions p" has text "Ok, one last time for practice - can you solve this one using only 4 blocks?"

  # This builds an uncommon program to avoid getting a crowdsourced hint.

  Scenario: Submit an incorrect program missing a block
    Then element "#runButton" is visible
    And element "#resetButton" is hidden
    # Repeat: move forward, turn right, turn right
    Then I drag block "4" to block "5"
    And I drag block "3" into first position in repeat block "6"
    And I drag block "1" to block "7"
    And I drag block "1" to block "8"
    And I press "runButton"
    And I wait until element ".uitest-topInstructions-inline-feedback" is visible

  Scenario: Submit a working program that uses too many blocks
    Then element "#runButton" is visible
