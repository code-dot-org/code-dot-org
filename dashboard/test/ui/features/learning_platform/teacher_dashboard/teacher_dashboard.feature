    # with that thumbnail appears in the projects list, by running and then
    # remixing a project-backed script level which has a predraw layer.
    #
    # We can't simply share the script level, because that doesn't make it
    # show up in the projects list. We can't just run the remixed project to
    # generate the thumbnail, because it will have lost the predraw layer.
    # Whether losing the predraw layer on remix is ok is a different issue, and
    # until it is resolved we want to make sure thumbnails include predraw.
