Feature: Applab Project

# as_student to actually perform sign-in/out before/after scenario
# no_mobile because we don't end up with open-workspace on mobile
# no_ie because applab is broken on IE9, and on IE10 this test crashes when we
#   try to execute any JS after our redirect on line 42

  And I get redirected to "/projects/applab/([^\/]*?)/edit" via "dashboard"
  And I rotate to landscape
  And I wait for the page to fully load
  Then evaluate JavaScript expression "localStorage.setItem('is13Plus', 'true'), true"
  And I switch to text mode
  And I add code "image('id', 'https://code.org/images/logo.png')" to ace editor
  And element ".project_updated_at" eventually contains text "Saved"
  And I click selector ".project_edit"
  And I type "Code Ninja" into "input.project_name"
  And I click selector ".project_save"
  And I wait until element ".project_edit" is visible
  Then I should see title "Code Ninja - App Lab"

  # Thumbnail is required to publish the project

  # Don't actually get redirect this time (stay on /view)
  And I get redirected to "/projects/applab/([^\/]*?)/view" via "nothing"
  And I wait to see "#codeWorkspace"
  And selector "#codeWorkspace" has class "readonly"
  And I should see title "Code Ninja - App Lab"

  # Now view the /edit page as a signed in, non-owner
  Given I am on "http://studio.code.org/"
  And I am a teacher
  And I am on "http://studio.code.org/users/sign_in"
  And I reload the page
