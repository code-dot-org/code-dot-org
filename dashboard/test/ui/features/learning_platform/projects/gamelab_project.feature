  And element "#runButton" is visible
  And element ".project_updated_at" eventually contains text "Saved"
  And I click selector ".project_edit"
  And I type "Code Ninja II: Uncaught Exception" into "input.project_name"
  And I click selector ".project_save"
  And I wait until element ".project_edit" is visible
