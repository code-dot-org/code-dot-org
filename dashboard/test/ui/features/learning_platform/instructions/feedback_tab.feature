Feature: Feedback Tab Visibility

Background:
  Given I create a teacher-associated student named "Lillian"
  And I am on "http://studio.code.org/s/allthethings/lessons/38/levels/1?noautoplay=true"
  Then I rotate to landscape
  And I wait to see "#runButton"
  And I press "runButton"
  And I wait to see "#finishButton"
  And I press "finishButton"

Scenario: As student 'Feedback' tab is not visible if no feedback
  #As student, with no feedback, can see Rubric tab on rubric level
  And I am on "http://studio.code.org/s/allthethings/lessons/38/levels/1"
  And I wait to see ".uitest-feedback"
  And element ".editor-column" contains text "Rubric"
  Then I click selector ".uitest-feedback"
  And I wait to see ".editor-column"
  And element ".editor-column" contains text "This is the key concept for this mini rubric."
  And element "#rubric-input-performanceLevel1" does not exist
  And element "#ui-test-submit-feedback" does not exist
  And element "#ui-test-feedback-time" does not exist
  And element "ui-test-feedback-input" does not exist
  Then I sign out

Scenario: As teacher, when viewing a level with student work,
feedback can be submitted and displayed. If there is a mini rubric, teacher can give feedback on rubric.
If a teacher on a level with mini rubric can see the rubric without viewing student work.
Otherwise don't show feedback tab
  Then I sign in as "Teacher_Lillian"
  And I give user "Teacher_Lillian" authorized teacher permission
