Feature: Feedback Tab Visibility

  Background:
    Given I create a teacher-associated student named "Lillian"
    And I am on "http://studio.code.org/s/allthethings/stage/38/puzzle/1?noautoplay=true"
    Then I rotate to landscape
    And I wait to see "#runButton"
    And I press "runButton"
    And I wait to see "#finishButton"
    And I press "finishButton"

  Scenario: As student 'Feedback' tab is the 'Key Concept' tab if no feedback
    When I open my eyes to test "student with no feedback"
    And I am on "http://studio.code.org/s/allthethings/stage/38/puzzle/1"
    And I wait for the page to fully load
    Then I see no difference for "student with no feedback tab"
    Then I sign out
    And I close my eyes

# Disabling IE due to bug where text changes in the feedback text input are not registered
# so submit button remains disabled
  Scenario: As teacher, when viewing a level with student work,
  feedback can be submitted and displayed. If there is a mini rubric, teacher can give feedback on rubric.
  If a teacher on a level with mini rubric can see the rubric without viewing student work.
  Otherwise don't show feedback tab
    When I open my eyes to test "teacher giving student feedback"
    And I sign in as "Teacher_Lillian"
    And I give user "Teacher_Lillian" authorized teacher permission

    And I am on "http://studio.code.org/s/allthethings/stage/38/puzzle/1"

    And I wait until element ".student-table" is visible
    And I click selector "#teacher-panel-container tr:nth(1)" to load a new page
    And I wait for the page to fully load

    And I wait to see "#rubric-input-performanceLevel1"
