  Then I wait until element "#ui-project-name" is in the DOM
  Then I wait until the first "#ui-project-name" contains text "Older Published"
  Then I make a playlab project named "Newer Published"
  Then I publish the project
  Given I am on "http://studio.code.org/projects/public"
  Then I wait until the first "#ui-project-name" contains text "Newer Published"
