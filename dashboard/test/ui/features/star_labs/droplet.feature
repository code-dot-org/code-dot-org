Feature: Droplet levels work as expected
  Background:
    Given I am on "http://studio.code.org/s/allthethings/lesson/18/puzzle/5?noautoplay=true"
    And I wait for the page to fully load

  Scenario: Open editcode level and write some autocompleted, tooltipped code
    When I rotate to landscape
    And I ensure droplet is in text mode
    And I wait until element ".ace_text-input" is visible
    And I press keys "b" for element ".ace_text-input"
    And the Droplet ACE text is "b"
    And I press keys "utto" for element ".ace_text-input"
    And the Droplet ACE text is "butto"
    And no Tooltipster tooltip is visible

    And I press keys ":down" for element ".ace_text-input"
    And the Droplet ACE text is "butto"
    And there is a Tooltipster tooltip with text "button(id, text)"

    And I press keys ":down" for element ".ace_text-input"
    And there is a Tooltipster tooltip with text "radioButton"

    And I press keys ":enter" for element ".ace_text-input"
    And the Droplet ACE text is "radioButton()"
    And there is a Tooltipster tooltip with text "unique identifier"

  Scenario: Open editcode level and verify parameter autocomplete replaces quoted text
    When I rotate to landscape
    And I ensure droplet is in text mode
    And I wait until element ".ace_text-input" is visible
    And I press keys "setProperty(" for element ".ace_text-input"
    And the Droplet ACE text is "setProperty()"
    And there is a Tooltipster tooltip with text "the specified element"

    And I press double-quote key for element ".ace_text-input"
    And the Droplet ACE text is 'setProperty("")'
    And no Tooltipster tooltip is visible

    And I press keys ":enter" for element ".ace_text-input"
    And the Droplet ACE text is 'setProperty("screen1")'
    And no Tooltipster tooltip is visible
