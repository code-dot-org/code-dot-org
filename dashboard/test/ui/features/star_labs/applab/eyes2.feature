Scenario: Applab visualization scaling
  When I open my eyes to test "Applab visualization scaling"
  And I am on "http://studio.code.org/projects/applab/new"
  And I rotate to landscape
  And I wait for the page to fully load
  And I switch to design mode

  Then I drag a TEXT_AREA into the app
  And I press keys "Here is a bunch of text" for element "#design-properties textarea"
  And I set input "xpos" to "100"
  And I set input "ypos" to "100"

  Then I switch to code mode
  And I press "show-code-header"
  And I add code for a canvas and a button
  And I press "runButton"
  And I see no difference for "medium scaling" using stitch mode "none"

  Then I drag the visualization grippy by 100 pixels
  And I see no difference for "large scaling" using stitch mode "none"

  And I see no difference for "small scaling" using stitch mode "none"

  Then I close my eyes
