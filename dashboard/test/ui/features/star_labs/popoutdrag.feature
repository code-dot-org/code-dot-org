Feature: Blocks can be dragged from popouts

Background:
  Given I am on "http://studio.code.org/s/20-hour/lessons/11/levels/1?noautoplay=true"
  And I wait for the lab page to fully load
  And I dismiss the login reminder

Scenario: Connect two blocks from toolbox
  When I press ":1.label"
  And I drag block "2" to block "1"
  And I press ":2.label"
  And I drag block "8" to block "6"
  And I wait for 1 seconds
  Then block "12" is child of block "6"
