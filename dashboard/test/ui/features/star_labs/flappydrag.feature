Feature: Flappy blocks can be dragged

Scenario: Connect two blocks from toolbox
  Given I am on "http://studio.code.org/flappy/1?noautoplay=true"
  When I rotate to landscape
  And I wait for the page to fully load
  And I wait to see ".blocklySvg"
  And I drag block "1" to block "3"
  And I drag block "1" to block "4"
  And I wait for 1 seconds
  Then block "5" is child of block "4"
