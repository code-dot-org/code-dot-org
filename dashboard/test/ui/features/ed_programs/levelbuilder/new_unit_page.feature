Feature: Using the New Unit Page

  Scenario: Create a new unit
    Given I create a levelbuilder named "Levi"
    And I am on "http://studio.code.org/s/new"
    And I wait until element ".isCourseSelector" is visible

    When I select the "Single Unit" option in dropdown with class "isCourseSelector"
    And I wait until element ".familyNameSelector" is visible
    And element ".familyNameInput" is visible
    And I enter a temp unit name
    And I wait until element ".isVersionedSelector" is visible
    And I select the "No" option in dropdown with class "isVersionedSelector"
    And the unit slug input contains the temp script name
    And I click "button[type='submit']" to load a new page

    Then I wait for the temp unit edit page to load
    And I click "button[type='submit']" to load a new page

    Then I wait for the temp unit overview page to load
    And I delete the temp unit
