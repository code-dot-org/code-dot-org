#
# This test is the comprehensive spec on the desired behavior when purging a
# user from our system (that is, hard-deleting a user).  If you need to change
# the user purge process, start by testing the desired behavior here, then work
# your way down to the appropriate implementation point.
#
# Purging a user is an irreversible operation.  We don't delete every row that
# has ever been associated with that user, but we do remove all sensitive
# information, anything that might possibly be used to identify the particular
# user, and anything we don't need to keep around for our metrics.
#
# Getting this right is important for compliance with various privacy
# regulations around the globe, so changes to this behavior should be carefully
# reviewed by the product team.
