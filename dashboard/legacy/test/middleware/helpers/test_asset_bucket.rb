# Unlike AssetsTest (test_assets.rb) which is essentially a controller test
# designed to full exercise the public API, this is meant to be more like a
# unit test for AssetBucket (asset_bucket.rb).
#
# However, we're using the FilesAPITestBase because some of the setup and
# teardown is easier to do through our actual API, and we want to use VCR
# to actually test S3 operations.
#
# The cdo-v3-assets bucket is unversioned, so some of the operations other
# buckets perform across multiple versions don't apply here.
