    If checked, students with teachers can "submit" a solution for
    grading. Submitting a solution means that it is marked as
    submitted and they can no longer edit it (unless a teacher returns
    it).

  %ul
    %li if Starting Sources are defined in the project template level, use those instead of the Starting Sources for this level
    %li autocreate a project that is shared with all levels with the same project template level
