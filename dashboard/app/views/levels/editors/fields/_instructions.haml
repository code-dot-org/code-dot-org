    Instructions

  #instructions.in.collapse

    %p
      Every level can have a combination of short and long instructions. When both
      are present, the long instructions will be presented by default but the
      instructions component can be "collapsed" down to show just the short
      instructions. This allows us to provide both detailed, potentially verbose
      instructions in the long instructions and short reminders of level goals
      that don't take up too much screen space in the short instructions.

    %p
      If only one version of instructions is provided, only that version will be
      shown.

    %p
      If neither instructions field is provided, the entire instructions component
      (including the hint prompt) will be omitted.

    .field
      = f.label :short_instructions, "Short Instructions"
      ~ f.text_area :short_instructions,
        placeholder: 'some short, plaintext instructions, used to quickly communicate the goals of the level without taking up too much vertical real estate',
        rows: 4, class:"input-block-level"

    .field
      = f.label :long_instructions, "Long Instructions"
      %p
        You can drag-and-drop or paste images in to this box, and they will be
        uploaded to a suitable location.
      %p
        markdown-enabled instructions can take advantage of
        = link_to 'various markdown rendering options', 'https://commonmark.org/help/'
        to provide more in-depth (and more vertically intrusive) instruction.

      %div{ style: 'border: 8px solid rgb(239, 239, 239)' }
        #level_long_instructions_preview{ style: 'padding: 20px' }
        %div{ style: 'background-color: rgb(239, 239, 239); padding-top: 12px' }
          ~ f.text_area :long_instructions, rows: 4

    .field
      = render partial: 'levels/editors/fields/checkboxes', locals: {f: f, field_name: :instructions_important, description: "Mark Instructions as Important"}
      %p
        Are these instructions particularly important? Is this level
        introducing some new concept or is set up in some unusual way that
        would be particularly confusing if the student were to jump right in
        and start solving without looking at the instructions first?

    = render partial: 'levels/editors/fields/tts', locals: {f: f}

:javascript
  var mdEditor = levelbuilder.initializeCodeMirror('level_long_instructions', 'markdown', {
    callback: function (editor, change) {
      convertXmlToBlockly(document.getElementById('level_long_instructions_preview'));

      localStorage.setItem('markdown_' + '#{@level.id || html_escape(params[:type])}', editor.getValue());
    },
    attachments: true
  });

  var locallyStoredMarkdown = localStorage.getItem('markdown_' + '#{@level.id || html_escape(params[:type])}');
  if (locallyStoredMarkdown) {
    mdEditor.setValue(locallyStoredMarkdown);
  }
