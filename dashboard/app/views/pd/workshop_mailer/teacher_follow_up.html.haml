  Hi
  = @enrollment.first_name + ','

  %p
  It has been one month since your CS Fundamentals Intro workshop. What steps have you taken since
  then to bring CS Fundamentals to your school or classroom? From collaborating with colleagues,
  to setting up class sections in the dashboard, to scheduling lessons, there are lots of ways to
  ensure computer science education is accessible to all students. We would love to hear how it is
  going! Tweet us stories and pictures @TeachCode!

  %p
  If you haven’t used CS Fundamentals in your classroom yet, that’s okay! Here are some steps to
  help you get started:

  %h3 Step 1: Choose a course
  On Code.org, you’ll find
  = link_to('courses for all grade levels', 'https://studio.code.org/courses?view=teacher')
  from pre-readers to seniors in high school, and everyone in between. All our courses are available
  at no cost. Chat with colleagues at your school to determine how the course curriculum can be
  integrated with a variety of subjects.

  %h3 Step 2: Set up your classroom section
  = link_to 'Set up a classroom section', 'https://studio.code.org/home'
  to view your student’s progress, print login cards for your students, manage their accounts,
  and print certificates they can bring home when they finish the course.

  %h3 Step 3: Start teaching
  All it takes is one lesson to bring computer science concepts into your classroom. Once you see
  your students enthusiasm for CS, go further with daily lesson plans to guide your students,
  = link_to 'unplugged activities', 'https://code.org/curriculum/unplugged'
  you can do without a computer, and
  = link_to 'forums', 'https://forum.code.org/'
  to connect to other teachers.
