    Pre-Course Survey
  %p
    Before starting your Summer Workshop,
    = link_to "please take this survey", CDO.code_org_url('/csp-pre-survey', CDO.default_scheme)
    about your thoughts on computer science in relation to teaching and
    learning. We will not share individual results beyond Code.org, our
    partners, and facilitators. We may, however, share aggregate data (for all
    teachers) publicly. It should take about 20-25 minutes to complete.
  %p
    This survey is really important for a few reasons:
  %ul
    %li
      It helps us understand who the population of teachers involved in our
      = @workshop.course
      PD program are.
    %li
      Your students will be asked to take a similar survey as part of the
      course. This gives you a bit of a preview of the kinds of questions we
      will ask them.
    %li
      To better understand what helps teachers and students succeed in the
      course.

    Thank you in advance for taking the time to do this!

    Pre-Workshop Tech Setup
  %p
    During the workshop, we will explore Unit 6 of the CS Discoveries course.
    Unit 6 uses the Circuit Playground and Maker App to get students hands-on experience with physical computing.
    In order to save time during the workshop for more exploration, we ask that you install the Maker App
    before attending the workshop. Directions for setting up the Maker App can be found at
