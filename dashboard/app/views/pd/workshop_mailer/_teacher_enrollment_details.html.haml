    Pre-Workshop Tech Setup
  %p
    During the workshop, we will explore Unit 6 of the CS Discoveries course.
    Unit 6 uses the Circuit Playground and Maker App to get students hands-on experience with physical computing.
    In order to save time during the workshop for more exploration, we ask that you install the Maker App
    before attending the workshop. Directions for setting up the Maker App can be found at
    = link_to('https://studio.code.org/maker/setup', 'https://studio.code.org/maker/setup') + '.'
    School- or district-owned laptops may require administrator permission to download Maker App,
    so we encourage you to start this process soon.
