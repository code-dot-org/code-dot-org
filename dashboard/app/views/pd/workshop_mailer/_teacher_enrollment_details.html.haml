      Reminder: For the best professional development experience, we strongly
      encourage you to engage in the pre-work that is specifically designed for
      CSA. The pre-work can be found at

      There is no requirement that you are familiar with the course before you
      join the workshop - we will walk you through what you need to know in our
      time together.

    Pre-Workshop Tech Setup
  %p
    During the workshop, we will explore Unit 6 of the CS Discoveries course.
    Unit 6 uses the Circuit Playground and Maker App to get students hands-on experience with physical computing.
    In order to save time during the workshop for more exploration, we ask that you install the Maker App
    before attending the workshop. Directions for setting up the Maker App can be found at
    = link_to('https://studio.code.org/maker/setup', 'https://studio.code.org/maker/setup') + '.'
    School- or district-owned laptops may require administrator permission to download Maker App,
    so we encourage you to start this process soon.
