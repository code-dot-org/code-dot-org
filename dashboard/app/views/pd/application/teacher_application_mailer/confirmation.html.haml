    If we find a spot, we'll let you know the workshop dates and program fees (if applicable) so you can decide at

    %strong Important Note:
    School Administrator/Leader Approval Form Required

  %p
    Please note that
    = @application.effective_regional_partner_name + "'s"
    requires approval from your school's administration/leadership for you to be considered for acceptance into the
    Program. The school administrator/leader that you indicated in your application received an email with the subject
    "Action Needed:
    = @application.first_name + ' ' + @application.last_name
    has applied to
    = @application.effective_regional_partner_name + "'s"
    Professional Learning Program!" with a link to the approval form. To prevent delay, we encourage you to also contact
    them directly to make them aware of the approval requirement. If they cannot find the email, you can also give them
    this unique link to the
    = link_to 'Administrator/School Leader approval form', @application.principal_approval_url
    for your application.

    %p
      After your school administrator/leader submits the approval form using the unique link,
      = @application.effective_regional_partner_name
      will review your application within 2-4 weeks.
      Your application will not be fully reviewed until the school administrator/leader approval
      form is received.

    %p
      Thank you for helping to expedite the application review process by letting your school administrator/leader
      know where to find the approval form in their inbox and the urgency of submitting it.
