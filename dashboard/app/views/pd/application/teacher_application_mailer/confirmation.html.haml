    We do not have a Regional Partner in your area. However, we have a number of partners in nearby states or regions who may have space available in their program. We'll let you know if we can find you a nearby spot in the program!

  %p
    If we find a spot, we'll let you know the workshop dates and program fees (if applicable) so you can decide at that point if it is something you or your school can cover.
