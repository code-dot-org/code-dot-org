  Hi
  = @application.first_name + ","

%p
  Thank you for applying to Code.orgâ€™s facilitator program. Our
  team appreciated the opportunity to review your application and learn about
  your commitment to Computer Science education. I'm writing to let you know
  that all seats in the program have been filled, so we are currently unable to
  offer you a space in the Facilitator Development Program this year. However, we
  would like to offer you a space on our waitlist should a space become
  available.

%p
  Please respond to this message to let us know if you would like to join the
  waitlist, or if you would like to withdraw your application from
  consideration.

  Thank you,
