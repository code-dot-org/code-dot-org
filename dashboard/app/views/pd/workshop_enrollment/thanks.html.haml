    If you don’t have a Code.org account yet, click
    = link_to 'here', CDO.studio_url('/users/sign_up')
    to create one. You'll need a Code.org account on the day of the workshop.
    You'll use this account to manage your students and view their progress
    when you start teaching, so be sure to use the email you'll use when you
    teach.
