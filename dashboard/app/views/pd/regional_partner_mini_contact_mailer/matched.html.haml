  A teacher or administrator in your region has asked us to connect them with their local Code.org
  Regional Partner. We let them know that youâ€™ll get back to them. Please follow up with them
  directly at your convenience.

  %strong Why is this person contacting you?
%p
  We encourage administrators and teachers to fill out
  = link_to 'this form', CDO.code_org_url('educate/professional-learning/contact-regional-partner', CDO.default_scheme)
  if they want to learn more about
  expanding CS in their schools. You can reach out to them to let them know about your resources
  and ask how you can help them do this.
%p
  We also ask educators to fill out the form to find out when applications open in their area.
  You should add their email to your list to let them know when you open applications for 6-12 PD
  or when you set up a K-5 workshop they can join.
%p
  They may also use this form to ask you a question about the Professional Learning Program.

  Best,
