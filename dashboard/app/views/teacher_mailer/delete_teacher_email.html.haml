  Hi #{@teacher.name},

  Your account has been deleted along with the accounts of all of your students that didn’t have a personal login or were not in another teacher’s section. If you think this was done in error, please contact us at support@code.org to recover your and your students’ accounts. These accounts will be permanently deleted in 28 days, after which we will no longer be able to recover them.
