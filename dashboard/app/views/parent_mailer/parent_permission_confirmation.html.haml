  Dear Parent/Guardian,

%p
  Thank you for approving your child's use of a Code.orgÂ® account (or adding a personal login to an existing Code.org account used in school).  By approving your child's account, you agree to the Code.org
  %a{href:SharedConstants::EMAIL_LINKS.TOS_URL}Terms of Service
  and
  %a{href:SharedConstants::EMAIL_LINKS.PRIVACY_POLICY_URL}Privacy Policy.

%p
  You can revoke your consent at any time by emailing us at
  %a{href:SharedConstants::EMAIL_LINKS.CDO_SUPPORT_MAILTO}support@code.org
  from this email address.  You can also self-delete your child's account by signing in and clicking the user name in the top right corner of the screen, and then selecting "account settings." Simply scroll down to the bottom of that page and follow the instructions there to delete the  account. If you don't see the option for deletion, your child is still enrolled in one or more teachers' sections, and you'll need to ask the teachers to remove them first from that section before you can delete the account.
