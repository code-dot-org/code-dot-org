  Keep track of what your child is learning
%p
  Parent excitement and involvement can help keep kids motivated as they learn - try checking in with your student when
  you can to see what they’ve built. Encourage them to browse the
  %a{href:"https://studio.code.org/projects/public"}games or artwork project gallery
  and get inspired to make their own code artwork. You can print it and hang it up, email it to a relative, or share it on social media.
