  Completing Phase 1: Online Introduction

  To successfully complete Phase 1 professional development, please refer back to the email "Important: Your Code.org enrollment and program information." Please note that you must complete Phase 1 prior to attending the Phase 2 workshop. In order to be paid for Phase 1, make sure that the progress circles in your Code Studio ECS progress bar are green.
