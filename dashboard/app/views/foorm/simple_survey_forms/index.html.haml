%h1 Foorm Simple Surveys

%p
  Simple surveys are a way to collect responses to a
  survey at a simple URL (both of your choosing).
%p
  Check out
  = link_to 'this page', new_foorm_simple_survey_form_path
  to create a new simple survey, or implement a new survey at an existing URL.
%p
  Here's a list of simple surveys that have been set up.
  Note that some surveys are disabled after they've been used (disabling currently only accessible to engineers),
  so you may see a message saying the survey has closed on some of these pages.

- Foorm::SimpleSurveyForm.all.pluck(:path).sort.uniq do |path|
  %p
    = link_to path, CDO.studio_url("form/#{path}", CDO.default_scheme)
