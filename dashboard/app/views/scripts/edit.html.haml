%p
  There are currently unsolved issues with renaming stages
  (see pivotal items:
  %a{href: "https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/76999866"} 76999866
  %a{href: "https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/82514628"} 82514628
  For now, ask an engineer - refer them to

%h4 Hiding and showing scripts
%p
  By default, scripts are hidden from teachers in the teacher
  dashboard. To make a script visible to teachers, add a line
  %code hidden 'false'
  to the top of the script. It will show up in the teacher dashboard
  once it hits staging (or the next time levelbuilder gets rebuilt).

%h4 Reordering stages
%p Reordering stages without renaming them is fine

%h4 Renaming levels
%p
  Renaming levels works for some level types (the UI will not let you
  rename levels that cannot be renamed). Changing only the case
  (uppercase/lowercase) of a level name causes problems (the UI will
  not let you do this). Note: renaming a level is essentially making a
  copy and deleting the old one. This means that progress in that
  level is lost, so don't do this for published scripts. If you do
  rename a level you need to update all scripts referencing it, this
  does not happen automatically.
