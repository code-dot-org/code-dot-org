  # believe they teach computer science, with the belief falling in the
  # range from 0.0 to 1.0.
  #
  # In a machine learning setting (such as spam filtering) the likelihoods
  # would be learned from labeled data (old messages marked a spam or not.)
  # In our case, we've hand crafted the likelihoods based on what we know
  # about the data sets.
  #
  # For each year, we set our prior to the previous year's posterior after
  # lowering it a bit. The assumption here is that there is some chance
  # that a school will stop teaching computer science.

  # options must add up to 1.0
