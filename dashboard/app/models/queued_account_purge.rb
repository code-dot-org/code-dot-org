#
# Represents an account that has been identified as needing to be purged from
# our system but for some reason we were unable to perform this action
# automatically. Common reasons a record would end up here:
#
# - An exception was raised while deleting the account
# - Some safety constraint was violated while deleting the account
#   (e.g. too many sections would be deleted)
#
# Rows in this table should be addressed manually by engineers, by investigating
# the queueing cause and then using the AccountPurger to delete the account.
