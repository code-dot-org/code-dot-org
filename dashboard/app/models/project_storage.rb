class ProjectStorage < ApplicationRecord
  # Conceptually, an instance of this class represents blob storage for all of
  # the projects belonging to a single user. The user may have an account (user_id
  # points to the user) or may be unsigned-in (user_id is nil). Under the covers,
  # metadata for this storage is stored in the 'user_project_storage_ids' table
  # and the blobs are stored in several S3 buckets depending on the blob type
  # (e.g. cdo-v3-sources/sources/<storage id>, cdo-v3-files/files/<storage id>, etc.).
