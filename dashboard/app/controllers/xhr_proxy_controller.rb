# A controller for proxying web requests to 3rd party APIs. This protects
# applab users from XSS attacks, complies with the Same Origin Policy,
# and prevents http/https mismatch warnings in IE.
#
# Responses are cached for one minute since many 3rd party APIs serve data
# which changes frequently such as news or sports scores.
#
# To reduce the likelihood of abuse, we only proxy content with an allowed
# whitelist of media types. We will need to monitor usage to detect
# abuse and potentially add other abuse prevention measures.
