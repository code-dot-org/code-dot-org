  # POST /policy_compliance/child_account_consent
  # This URL creates a parental permission request. It is invoked via the
  # lockout panel or potentially user settings by the child account.
  #
  # There are several limits imposed that are reflected in the logic below:
  # * Student may only send permission requests to 3 unique email addressed per day.
  # * Student may only "resend" to a particular email address at most 2 times.
  # * Student cannot send a request to their own email address.
  #
  # This is to control for abuse vectors that might try to overwhelm our email
  # system. It is, effectively, a limit of 9 emails, on average, per studetnt pet
  # day.
  #
  # When such a limit is reached, this logic silently 'succeeds'. That is, it
  # acts like the email was sent and sends no notice to the student it was not.
