  # specifically for Music Lab. When we start using Amplitude for other
  # applications, we should create a dedicated controller/util that serves
  # API keys for various analytics projects, not just Music Lab.
  # We may also need to move the Amplitude analytics reporting
  # client to the back-end to avoid exposing keys (as we are currently).
