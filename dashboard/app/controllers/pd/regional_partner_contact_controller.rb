        Somebody called GET #{request.path}, which was deprecated in February 2020.
        This might be a regional partner or Code.org staff member sharing a saved link,
        but we should follow up and see if we have a leftover link to this route somewhere.
        See https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org/pull/33024 for details.
