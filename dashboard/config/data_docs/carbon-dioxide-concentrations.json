Its concentration has increased more than 30 percent since the beginning of the Industrial Era. These data have a grid spacing of 1 degree longitude and 1 degree latitude. UNITS: The units of these data are parts per million by volume, which is a ratio of the volume of this gas to a much larger volume of air. A concentration of 1 ppmv is equal to mixing a volume of carbon dioxide equal to about 7 standard cans of soda (2.5 liters or 84 fluid ounces) into a volume of air that would fit into an Olympic-sized swimming pool (2.5 million liters or 660,400 gallons)."
