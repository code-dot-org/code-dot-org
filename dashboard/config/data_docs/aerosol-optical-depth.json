Different aerosols scatter or absorb sunlight to varying degrees, depending on their physical properties. The higher the optical depth, the more light is absorbed or scattered by aerosols. These data have a grid spacing of 0.5 degrees longitude and 0.5 degrees latitude. UNITS: Since the optical depth is a ratio of incoming light to the light scattered by aerosols, it is a quantity that has no units (dimensionless).\r\n"
