Precipitation includes both rain and snowfall, with snowfall contributing as the amount of liquid created when the snow is melted down. The total monthly precipitation at any location can be calculated by taking the precipitation rate and multiplying by the number of days in a month. The rate is an average; it does not mean that precipitation consistently falls at this rate throughout the month at any location. In fact, most hours in the month tend to have zero precipitation, while a much smaller number of hours have small but measureable amounts of precipitation, and a few hours each month have large amounts of precipitation. These data have a grid spacing of 0.5 degrees longitude and 0.5 degrees latitude. UNITS: The units of the precipitation rate are millimeters per day. If the average rate at a location is one inch per day, then this is the same as 25.4 mm/day.\r\n"
