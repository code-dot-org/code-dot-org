module Cdo
  # Rails caches information about valid attributes based on the state of the
  # database at initialization time, which means if a new migration has run on
  # the database since then, that cache might be operating off of old
  # information. Something like `Model.new(Model.last.attributes)` will result
  # in `Model.new` using stale validation logic against fresh attributes from
  # `Model.last`, which may not work.
  #
  # To resolve, if we get an UnknownAttributeError, we first check to see if
  # there have been any new migrations executed against the database since this
  # instance of Rails was initialized. If there have been, we attempt to
  # refresh some caches and try again before treating this as an actual error.
  #
  # Note that this solution was crafted for Ruby on Rails v6.1.7.7, and is
  # unfortunately reliant on some implementation details which may change in
  # later versions.
