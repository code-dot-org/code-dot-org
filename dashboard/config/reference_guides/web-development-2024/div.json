  "content": "## What is a \"div\" tag?\n\nDiv stands for “division” or “section”. When you are organizing the layout of your webpage, it is often helpful to organize the content into sections. The `div` tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document. It is often used as a **container** for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS. \n\n## What does a \"div\" tag do?\n\nThe `div` tag does not _really_ do anything _visible_; it just divides the document into sections, so it is convenient for you to work with a document by splitting it into different sections.\n\n\nThe `div` tag is easily styled by using the class or id attribute. \n\n```\n<div class=\"container1\">\n  <p>My paragraph</p>\n  <img src=\"myImage.jpg\" alt=\"my image\">\n</div>\n```\n\nAny sort of content can be put inside the `div` tag!\n\n**Note:** By default, the `div` element is a block element, meaning that it takes all available width, and comes with line breaks before and after the `div` element.\n\n## Multiple \"div\" elements\n\nYou can have many `div` containers on the same page and style them separately with CSS.\n\n```\n<div class=\"London\">\n  <h2>London</h2>\n  <p>London is the capital city of England.</p>\n  <p>London has over 13 million inhabitants.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"Oslo\">\n  <h2>Oslo</h2>\n  <p>Oslo is the capital city of Norway.</p>\n  <p>Oslo has over 600.000 inhabitants.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"Rome\">\n  <h2>Rome</h2>\n  <p>Rome is the capital city of Italy.</p>\n  <p>Rome has almost 3 million inhabitants.</p>\n</div>\n```\n**Possible Result After Styling with CSS:**\n\n![](https://images.code.org/79e10063e474b27213e5432b64a807bc-divLondon.png)\n\n## Aligning \"div\" Elements Side by Side\n\nWhen building web pages, you often want to have two or more `div` elements side by side, like this:\n\n![](https://images.code.org/6f8732884d8e5423d6487778aa909852-divSide.png)\n\nThere are different methods for aligning elements side by side, all include some CSS styling. The example above was styled using the `float: left` and `width: 33%` CSS properties.\n\n*See the CSS guides for more styling information.*\n\n",
