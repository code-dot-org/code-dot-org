It had two inputs that you could use to specify its x and y coordinates.  [`rect`(#f78183)](/docs/applab/rect/) also has two more **optional parameters**.  These parameters are used to specify its width and height.  You can use the arrows on the right hand side of the block to show or hide these optional parameters.\r\n\r\n## Ellipse\r\n\r\nEllipse also has optional parameters for its width and height after the x and y parameters.  You can show or hide these optional parameters with the arrow on the right hand side of the block, just like with the [`rect`(#f78183)](/docs/applab/rect/) block.\r\n",
