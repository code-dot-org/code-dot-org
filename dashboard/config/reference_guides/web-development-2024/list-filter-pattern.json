  "content": "## Filtering one list\n\nThis pattern allows the user to filter a list into a new list by limiting the information that is added to the new list. For example, you could filter a list of words so that only words of a certain length or words that start with a specific letter appear in the new list. \n\n| Name  | Code |\n| ------------- | ------------- |\n| List Filter - starting letter (block) | ![](https://images.code.org/60dba8f6e9b0918c5fcb9642c1f9e1e0-image-1557517583801.PNG) |\n----------\n| List Filter - starting letter (text) | ![](https://images.code.org/239e03f2f947983da75a6a79e648aa29-image-1557517593754.PNG) |\n\n\n| Name  | Code | \n| ------------- | ------------- |\n| List Filter - length (block) | ![](https://images.code.org/87c64d8d090a56cb8a7879e387b02ea3-image-1557517603361.PNG) |\n----------\n| List Filter - length (text) | ![](https://images.code.org/0128cf312c3929f23a23cf49dd8206ad-image-1557517609421.PNG) |\n\n### How does it work?\n\n* Create a variable and store a list in it\n* Create a blank list to store the filtered list\n* In a function use a for loop to access each element in the original list\n* If that element meets a certain condition, append it to the filtered list\n\n## Filtering multiple lists\n\nWhat if you have multiple lists, but want to filter all the lists based on the information in a single list? \n\n| Name  | Code |\n| ------------- | ------------- |\n| Multiple List Filter (block)  | ![](https://images.code.org/11e96fc2d38590cd246c235df99d093c-image-1557517616358.PNG) | \n----------\n| Multiple List Filter (text)  | ![](https://images.code.org/f32e800902e5c031a937c9579f033c5c-image-1557517622854.PNG) | \n\n* All the lists must be the same length for this pattern - ideally they are columns pulled from a table\n\n### How does it work?\n\n* Create a variable for each list\n* Create blank lists to store the filtered lists \n* In a function, first reset all filtered lists to blank lists. Every time the function is called, the filtered lists will reset. \n* Use a for loop to access each item in the list that contains the element you are filtering by\n* If the element is found, append to each filtered list the element at the index in the original lists where the element was found",
