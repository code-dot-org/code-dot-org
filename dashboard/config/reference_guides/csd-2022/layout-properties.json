A bigger radius makes a bigger, softer curve, and a smaller radius makes a smaller, sharper curve. A radius of zero makes a regular corner. You can read more about this property at [W3Schools - CSS3 border-radius property](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_border-radius.asp).\n2) **What if an element inside the page has a different background color from the body?**\n   - You can see the answer to this question by adding a `background-color` rule to the `p` tag. The paragraphs will have the background color in the rule for the `p` tag, and the rest of the page will follow the rule for the `body` tag.\n3) **Why does using a width and height property at the same time sometimes stretch out the image?**\n   - When the width of an image changes, the height must change by the same percentage, otherwise the image will stretch. For example, if you double the width of an image, you must also double the height, or the image will be stretched horizontally. When you only define the width or the height, the computer will automatically change the other property so that the image looks the same.\n\n\n",
