First, you need to mark the elements in HTML that will be in that class.\r\n2. Second, you need to write a style rule-set for that class. To write a rule for a class of elements, the selector for the rule-set has a `.` before the class name. \r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, the code below would style the fancy class which has been set up for a paragraph element:\r\n\r\n\r\n| HTML file | CSS File | Result |\r\n| --------- | -------- | ------ |\r\n| <pre> &lt;p class=\"fancy\"&gt;Good Day&lt;/p&gt; <br> &lt;p&gt;Bad Day&lt;/p&gt;</pre> |<pre>.fancy {<br>  color: darkblue;<br>  font-family: cursive;<br>} </pre>|<img src=\"https://images.code.org/27181e31f4e697a85f1794f28070ba14-image-1481648310560.58.03 AM.png\" alt=\"result image\"> | \r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n**W3 Schools Links**\r\n\r\n* [CSS Syntax (Classes)](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_syntax.asp)",
