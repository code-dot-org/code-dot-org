The user is interested in seeing items in a list, like a list of favorite foods, or a list of reminders.\n2. The app shows the user one item in the list at a time.\n3. By clicking buttons (or otherwise interacting with the app) the user can move back and forth through the list, one item at a time, to see every item.\n\nThis pattern allows a user to \"scroll\" through all the items in the list. In order to make it work, create an index variable and a list. Then use the \"Counter Pattern with Event\" pattern to create event handlers to change the value of the index.\n\nThis pattern makes sense to use with the `updateScreen` pattern since you will need at least two buttons for scrolling left and right through the list but afterwards will use the same code to update the screen.\n\n",
