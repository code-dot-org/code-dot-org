  "content": "## What is a Model Card?\n\n| Explanation | Visual |\n|-|-|\n| Once an AI model is trained, itâ€™s very difficult to understand why a model is making certain decisions or predictions, especially if a human would have made a different decision with the same information. One way to avoid this is with **Model Cards.** Model cards are pieces of documentation that provide transparency and help unpack how machine learning models are created. | ![](https://images.code.org/4f12fcdc1f2889b0a9db221af5286deb-AI_ML Video Slides 1.png) |\n| One way to think about model cards is how nutrition labels work on your food. They both provide information about how the product was made, any warnings you should be aware of before using, and sometimes there are even examples of what you can use the product for. | ![](https://images.code.org/0d4c70c1455e165b830788d8f9f361e5-AI_ML Video Slides 2.png) |\n\n<br />\n\n**Diving Deeper:** Model Cards were initially proposed as part of the academic paper [Model Cards for Model Reporting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03993.pdf), led by Dr Timnit Gebru and Dr Margaret Mitchell. One of the co-authors of this paper, Dr Deb Raji, is featured in this [video clip discussing Model Cards](https://youtu.be/Ok5sKLXqynQ?t=1113). The Model Cards used in AI Lab are an adapted, simplified version of the original proposal for model cards.\n\n## Using Model Cards in AI Lab\n\nTo import a model into App Lab, press the gear icon in the upper-left corner of the App Lab Toolbox and select Manage AI Models\n\n<hr style=\"clear:both\">\n\n<img style=\"margin-right: 10px; margin-left: 10px; border: 2px solid black\" src=\"https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/Import-AI-Models_2l1FmrZ.png\"/>\n\n[diagram_nums]\n\n1. You can select which model to import using the dropdown menu\n2. Press the Import button to import your model into App Lab\n3. Press the Delete button to delete the model from your account\n4. The Model Card for each model will appear on the right-hand side. You can use this to help decide whether or not you want to use this model in your app.\n\n[/diagram_nums]\n\n## Video\n\n(Opens YouTube in new tab)\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz_ptkv0NxA\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/Capture_vR2LaoG.PNG\" /></a>\n\n\n\n\n\n",
