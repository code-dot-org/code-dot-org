Many of these elements can be used to take input from your user.\n\n\n## Choosing Good IDs\n\nEach UI element in your app needs an ID that you can refer to later. Good IDs are **meaningful, descriptive, and unique**.\n\nFor example, if you have many buttons in your program, you will want to give each an ID that describes what the button does. \n\nSo, instead of this:\n \n * \"button1\" and \"button2\"\n\nYou might make IDs that tell you not only that it's a button, but what you intend the button to be used for, like:\n\n * \"homeButton\" and \"saveButton\" or\n * \"buttonHome\" and \"buttonSave\" or\n * \"home\\_button\" and \"save\\_button\"\n\n## Rules About IDs\n\nIn making descriptive and meaningful IDs there **are some rules about IDs** you need to know.  IDs...\n\n* are case-sensitive.\n* cannot contain spaces.\n* *must* begin with a letter (A-Z or a-z) and may be followed by any number of digits and letters.\n* can contain hyphens (\"-\"), underscores (\"_\"), colons (\":\"), or periods (\".\").\n\n**Case-sensitive?**\n\nThis means there is a difference between \"HomeButton\" and \"homeButton\"  (notice the Capital H on the first one).\n\nThese differences seem annoying at first, but you get used to it, and actually appreciate the fact that the computer requires such precision.\n\nThere are a few common styles for capitalizing and spelling multi-word IDs:\n\n* **Capitalization (known as \"camelCase\")** -- \"aCamelcaseNameMightLookLikeThis\"\n* **Underscores (known as \"snake_case\")** -- \"some\\_people\\_like\\_to\\_use\\_underscores\\_to\\_separate\\_words\"\n* **Dashes (known as \"kebab-case\")** -- \"others-like-to-use-hyphens-or-dashes\"\n\nWhatever you choose is up to you. It's your style. It just helps to be consistent.\n\n\n\n",
