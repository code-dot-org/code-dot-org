Like an LED circuit, a button circuit can be created by connecting one wire to a data pin and another wire to a ground pin. To \"close\" the circuit (which is like pressing a button) you connect the two wires, either by touching them to each other or connecting them to a piece of hardware (like a button or switch) that can be used to open and close the circuit. An \"open\" button is equivalent to the button \"up\" event, while a \"closed\" circuit is like the button \"down\" event.\n\nWith a Circuit Playground Express board, you can create a button circuit on any of pins **\"A6\"**, **\"A5\"**, **\"A4\"**, **\"A0\"**, or **\"A1\"**\n\nWith a Circuit Playground Classic board, you can create a button circuit on any of pins **0**, **2**, **3**, **6**, and **12**.\n\n[clearfix]\n\n[/clearfix]\n\n## Creating Button Circuits\n\nTo create a button circuit you'll need a data pin, two wires, and a ground pin.\n\n* Connect a wire to your numbered data pin.\n* Connect a different wire to a ground pin.\n\n## Coding a Button Circuit (Circuit Playground Express)\n```\n\\\\ Create a button attached pin A5\nvar myButton = createButton(\"A5\");\n\n\\\\ Add an event handler to the new button\nonBoardEvent(myButton, \"down\", function() {\n\tconsole.log(\"button pressed\");\n});\n```\n\n## Coding a Button Circuit (Circuit Playground Classic)\n\n```\n\\\\ Create a button attached pin 0\nvar myButton = createButton(0);\n\n\\\\ Add an event handler to the new button\nonBoardEvent(myButton, \"down\", function() {\n\tconsole.log(\"button pressed\");\n});\n```\n",
