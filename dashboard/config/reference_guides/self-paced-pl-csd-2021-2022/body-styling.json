  "content": "The `<body>` element is a special element that wraps all of the visible content on a web page. Because everything that you see is inside this tag, any rule-set that you create for the body element will apply to every element on page, unless the element itself has a rule that contradicts it. This is useful for establishing a baseline style for everything on your page.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nThis rule-set would make all text in your web page blue and centered.\r\n\r\n```\r\nbody {\r\n    text-align: center;\r\n    color: blue;\r\n}\r\n```",
