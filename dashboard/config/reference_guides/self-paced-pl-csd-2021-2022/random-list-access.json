The user is interested in seeing items in a list, like a list of favorite foods, or a list of reminders.\r\n2. The app shows the user one item in the list at a time.\r\n3. By clicking buttons (or otherwise interacting with the app) the a new random item in the list is shown to the user.\r\n\r\nThis pattern allows a user to see random elements in a list. In order to make it work, create an index variable and a list. Then generate a random number between 0 and the length of the list minus one and set the index to that value. Then update the screen.\r\n",
