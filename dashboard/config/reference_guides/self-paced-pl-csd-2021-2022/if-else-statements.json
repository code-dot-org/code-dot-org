Those are the options.\n\nYou saw in the video how to add an *else* clause to an if-statement -- hit the little `+` symbol on the tail of the *if* statement.\n\nInside the curly braces for the *else* clause you put lines of code that you want to run if the Boolean condition from the *if* statement is *false*.\n\nSome important notes about the else clause:\n\n* The `else` must come *immediately* after the closing curly brace of an *if* statement\n* The `else` also has its own set of opening and closing curly braces to encapsulate lines of code\n\n<br><br>\n\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/b7711c7851e5cc9bd08fa53500d692ce-image-1479495721089.png\" style=\"float: right; width: 275px\">\n\nConsidering our flow chart from before, until now we haven't had a way to make the program do something different if the condition was *false*.  With an `if-else` statement we do. \n\nWe can now write a program that \"branches\" at a particular point, running one of two possible sections of code.\n\n<div style=\"clear: both\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n## A Worked Example\n\n<div style=\"clear: both\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/2e05fc16d828eda2cc4ef5db036d635a-image-1479496055965.png\" style=\"float: right;margin: 10px;\">\n\n[diagram_nums]\n\n1. Lines of code execute sequentially as usual. Prompt the user to enter their age.\n2. The _if_ statement and Boolean expression are also the same as before. The expression evaluates to either `true` or `false`.\n3. With an _if-else_ statement you are guaranteeing that exactly one of these two sections of code **will** execute.  If the condition is `true` (age is 18 or greater) then the lines of code inside the if-statement's curly braces are executed. If the condition is `false` it jumps to the else clause and executes any lines of code it finds between the else clause's curly braces.\n4. Finally the program picks up normal execution directly after the _if-else_ block. At this point in the program, we know that _either_ the code in the if-block _or_ the else block has executed.\n\n[/diagram_nums]",
