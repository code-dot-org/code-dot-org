  "content": "The _image_ tag allows you to add images to your page. You might notice that this tag looks a little different than those you've seen before. Unlike paragraph, header, or list tags, the image tag _doesn't require a closing tag_. All of the information needed to display your image is contained within the tag itself.\n\n## Image Source and Alternate Text\n\nIn order to tell the browser which file to use, extra information, called an attribute, is added to the image tag inside the brackets. The attribute **src** stands for source and tells the name of the image, and the attribute **alt** describes the image.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdo-curriculum.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/img_tag.png\" class=\"center\" style=\"max-width: 500px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;\"/>\n\n[diagram_nums]\n\n1. Create an image tag using the abbreviation **img**. This is considered a _self closing_ tag, since it doesn't need to wrap text as many other tags do. \n2. The **src** attribute is short for **source**. This tells the tag which image to load. In this case, the page will look for an image with the filename `dog.jpg` in the same directory as the page. Image file names include extensions that tell the computer which type of image they are working with. Common extensions are `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, and `.png`. Make sure to put quotation marks around your image filename. \n3. The **alt** attribute is short for **alternative text**. While you won't see this text on your web page, it provides a backup in case your image doesn't download properly or for visually impaired users. In this example, if your browser failed to load the image you would see <img src=\"https://cdo-curriculum.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/broken_image.png\" style=\"height: 50px;\">\n\n\n[/diagram_nums]\n\n**W3 Schools Links**\n\n* [&lt;img&gt;](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp)",
