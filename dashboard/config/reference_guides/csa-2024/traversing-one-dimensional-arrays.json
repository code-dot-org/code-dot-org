  "content": "We can use a `while`(#e7e8ea) loop to traverse a 1D array.\n- We use a variable called `index`(#e7e8ea) to keep track of our current position. It is initialized to 0 to start at the first element.\n- The condition for the `while`(#e7e8ea) loop checks if the current value assigned to `index`(#e7e8ea) is less than the length of the 1D array. It will repeat as long as the condition is `true`(#e7e8ea).\n- We can then use the current value assigned to `index`(#e7e8ea) to access the element at that position in the 1D array.\n- To move to the next element, we add 1 to the `index`(#e7e8ea) variable.\n\n```\nint[] scores = {75, 90, 83};\n\nint index = 0;\n\nwhile (index < scores.length) {\n  System.out.println(scores[index]);\n  index += 1;\n}\n```",
