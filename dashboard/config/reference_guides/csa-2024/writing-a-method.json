  "content": "## What is a method?\n\nA **method** is a reusable block of code that can be called in a program to complete a certain task.\n\n## How do I write a method?\n\nA method is written in a class using the following syntax:\n\n```\npublic returnType methodName() {\n   // code to execute\n}\n```\n\nBe sure to replace `returnType`(#e7e8ea) with the return type for the method (for example, `void`(#e7e8ea)) and `methodName`(#e7e8ea) with the name of the method you are writing.\n\nWe use curly braces ( `{ }`(#e7e8ea) ) to indicate the start and end of the body of a method. The statements written inside the curly braces ( `{ }`(#e7e8ea) ) are executed when the method is called.",
