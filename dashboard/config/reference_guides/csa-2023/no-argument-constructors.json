  "content": "## What is a constructor?\n\nBefore we can create an object, we need a constructor. A **constructor** is a block of code that has the same name as the class and tells the computer how to create a new object.\n\nIf no constructor is defined in the class, Java provides a no-argument constructor is provided by default.\n\n### General rules for writing constructors\n\n* Constructors must have the same name as the class\n\n* Constructors do not have a return type\n\n* Constructors cannot be declared as static or final\n\n## What is a no-argument constructor?\n\nA **no-argument constructor** is a constructor that has no parameters, meaning there is nothing inside the parentheses. It is typically used to assign default values to the instance variables.\n\nFor example,\n\n```\npublic class Song {\n  private String title;\n  private int numMins;\n\n  public Song() {\n    title = \"unknown\";\n    numMins = 0;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis no-argument constructor for the `Song`(#e7e8ea) class assigns `\"unknown\"`(#e7e8ea) as the default value for `title`(#e7e8ea) and `0`(#e7e8ea) as the default value for `numMins`(#e7e8ea) when a `Song`(#e7e8ea) object is created.\n\n## Can I have multiple constructors?\n\nA class can have multiple constructors as long as they have different parameter values. The **constructor signature** helps Java differentiate between the different constructors.\n\nA **constructor signature** consists of the name of the constructor and the list of its parameters.\n\n## How do I use a constructor?\n\nWhen we instantiate an object, we are calling the constructor.\n\nFor example,\n\n```\nSong favSong = new Song();\n```\n\nThe `Song()`(#e7e8ea) portion of this code calls the no-argument constructor in the `Song`(#e7e8ea) class. Now `favSong`(#e7e8ea) has its own copy of the instance variables `title`(#e7e8ea) and `numMins`(#e7e8ea) that are assigned the default values `\"unknown\"`(#e7e8ea) and `0`(#e7e8ea).",
