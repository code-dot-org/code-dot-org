  "content": "## Animations\n\n\n![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation4.gif)\n\nAn animation uses a series of pictures to create the illusion of smooth movement. Each individual picture is called a frame. You'll usually need to see at least several frames a second for the movement to look smooth. \n\n\n## The Draw Loop\n\n![](https://images.code.org/ad4f33288fa89d0667dc61383ae81f51-image-1492190061445.10.39 AM.png)\n\nTo create animations, you'll need a way to keep drawing frame after frame. In Game Lab, this is done using the `draw` function. The way programs run in Game Lab is\n\n1. Run every piece of code outside `draw`\n2. Keep running the code inside `draw` over and over again, 30 times a second\n\nEach time the code inside `draw` runs is like a new page in a flipbook. By making small changes to what's drawn each time, you can use Game Lab to create animations. \n\n## Draw Loop with Shapes\n\n| Code | Animation |\n|---|---|\n|![](https://images.code.org/a0e0030c24670ea070d084e37d909c89-image-1492193972332.02.31 AM.png)|<img src=\"https://images.code.org/4fb785c73362acbcad5639fb74706b38-image-1492194379719.gif\" style=\"float:right;height:150px\">|\n\nThis program sets the fill color and turns off the stroke outside the draw loop, then runs the code inside `draw` over and over.  The program will keep drawing dots in random locations forever.\n\n## Draw Loop with Sprites\n\n| Code | Animation |\n|---|---|\n|![](https://images.code.org/fbca9ea705ee67c65a761a8f30344111-image-1492196937332.07.56 PM.png)|<img src=\"https://images.code.org/b2c4dc68aa90fc1b56421ec69a66fa77-image-1492196934112.gif\" style=\"height:150px\">|\n\nThis program creates a sprite and sets its animation outside the draw loop. Then it repeatedly gives the sprite a new x location and redraws the orange background and the sprite to make it move.",
