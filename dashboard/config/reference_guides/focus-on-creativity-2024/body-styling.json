  "content": "The `<body>` element is a special element that wraps all of the visible content on a web page. Because everything that you see is inside this tag, any rule-set that you create for the body element will apply to every element on page, unless the element itself has a rule that contradicts it. This is useful for establishing a baseline style for everything on your page.\n\n## Example\n\nThis rule-set would make all text in your web page blue and centered.\n\n```\nbody {\n    text-align: center;\n    color: blue;\n}\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n1) **What does the body selector do?**\n   - Because the content of the web page is all inside the `body` tag, the **body selector** gives style rules for *everything* on the web page.\n",
