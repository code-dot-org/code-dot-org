The **copy** button creates a duplicate of the current animation. This is useful for creating multiple versions of an animation for a single sprite, such as pointing in different directions, or jumping and walking animations.\n2. The **flip** button flips the current image across the vertical axis. If you hold down the _Alt_ key (or _Option_ on a Mac) while clicking, you can instead flip across the horizontal axis.\n3. The **rotate** button rotates the current image 90 degrees counter-clockwise. If you hold down the _Alt_ key (or _Option_ key on a Mac) while clicking, you can rotate clockwise instead.\n\n[/diagram_nums]",
