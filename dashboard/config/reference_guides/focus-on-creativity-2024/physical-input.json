The **Reset Button** can't be used in your program. Clicking it makes the board reset itself, so don't press it while your program is running. But, you can use it if your board isn't working right.\n\n2.  The left and right buttons on the board are called `buttonL` and `buttonR`. They're the same except for where they are on the board. When looking at the board with the USB port at the top, the left button is `buttonL` and the right button is `buttonR`.\n\n3. The **Toggle Switch** is available in code as [`toggleSwitch`(#f78183)](/docs/applab/toggleSwitch/). \n\n## Events and Event Types\n\n### Left and Right Buttons:\n\n| Event Type  |  Description |  \n|---|---|\n| `down` | Triggers when the button is pressed down.|\n| `up` | Triggers when the button pops back up after being pressed.| \n\n### Toggle Switch:\n\n|  Event Type  | Description  |   \n|---|---|\n| `open` |  When the toggleSwitch is flipped to open (or `true`) |\n| `close`  |  When the toggleSwitch is flipped to closed (or `false`) |\n| `change`  | When the toggleSwitch is flipped at all  |\n\n## State\n\nBoth buttons and the switch have only two states.\n\nButtons are usually off (false) and turn on (true) when pressed. You can see if a button is being pressed with [`buttonL.isPressed`(#f78183)](/docs/applab/isPressed/).\n\nThe switch stays in the position you put it in. When it's on the left, it's open (true), and on the right, it's closed (false).\n\nThere are plus and minus signs near the switch to help you remember. You can check the switch's position with the [`toggleSwitch.isOpen`(#f78183)](/docs/applab/toggleSwitch.isOpen/) block.",
