Are there any significant trends or anomalies?\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**✅ Step 4**]\r\n**Form a Hypothesis:**\r\nDiscuss with a partner and create a brief hypothesis about the data.

    "teacher_markdown": "**What Students Should Take Away:**\r\n- Students practice identifying the minimum and maximum snow and ice coverage values to understand the dataset’s range.\r\n- Students apply the sum() function to calculate the total coverage over time, which helps quantify the overall impact.\r\n- Students use agg() and groupby() together to calculate multiple statistics, enabling them to summarize the data effectively and identify key trends.\r\n\r\n**Misconceptions Students Might Have or Points They Might Struggle With and Tips to Assist:**\r\n- Students might think that only one statistic (e.g., mean) is important, neglecting the significance of other statistics.\r\n  - Tip: Encourage students to consider how each statistic offers a different perspective. For instance, the mean shows overall trends, while min and max highlight extremes.\r\n- Students may find it challenging to interpret what the data reveals about environmental changes in Greenland.\r\n  - Tip: Prompt students to consider how changes in snow and ice coverage could impact the broader environment. Use examples to show the connection between data trends and real-world effects."
