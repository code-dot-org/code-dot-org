Use examples to illustrate common invalid entries.\r\n  - Tip: Discuss the pros and cons of dropping versus replacing invalid values, emphasizing the importance of context in making these decisions.\r\n- Filling Missing Values: Students might have difficulty understanding the implications of different methods for filling missing values and choosing appropriate substitutes.\r\n  - Tip: Explain the different methods for filling missing values (e.g., mean, median, mode) and provide examples of when each method is appropriate.\r\n  - Tip: Encourage students to consider the impact of their choice on the dataset's overall distribution and analysis results.\r\n- Re-evaluating the Dataset: Students might overlook the importance of re-evaluating the dataset after cleaning it to ensure all issues have been addressed.\r\n  - Tip: Emphasize the importance of re-evaluating the dataset to catch any remaining issues and ensure the data is ready for analysis.\r\n  - Tip: Encourage students to systematically reapply the initial evaluation functions (info(), describe(), isnull().sum()) after cleaning the data.\r\n- Creating Visualizations: Students might struggle with selecting appropriate visualizations to check for data quality and interpreting the visual output to ensure the dataset is clean.\r\n  - Tip: Provide guidance on selecting appropriate visualizations (e.g., bar charts, histograms) to check for data quality.\r\n  - Tip: Teach students how to interpret visualizations to identify any remaining data quality issues and ensure the dataset is clean and usable.\r\n",
