Highlight key indicators, such as the presence of NaN values and statistical summaries.\r\n   - Tip: Encourage students to compare the output from isnull() with the results from head() and tail() to see how missing values are represented in the dataset.\r\n- Students might have difficulty recognizing invalid values and understanding how they affect the dataset.\r\n   - Tip: Explain what constitutes an invalid value in the context of the dataset. Provide examples of common invalid values, such as text in numeric columns or out-of-range values.\r\n   - Tip: Discuss the impact of invalid values on data analysis, emphasizing how they can distort results and lead to incorrect conclusions."
