Discuss how class distribution might influence satisfaction levels.\r\n- Students may have difficulty connecting the insights from the pie chart to those from the stacked bar chart.\r\n  - Tip: Guide students through the process of analyzing both charts together. Discuss how class distribution might influence satisfaction levels and overall passenger experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
