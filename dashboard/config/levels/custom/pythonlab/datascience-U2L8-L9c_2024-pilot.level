Discuss how these factors could vary by class and how this is reflected in the data.\r\n- Students may have difficulty understanding how to sum passenger counts in each satisfaction level and how this relates to class.\r\n  - Tip: Guide students through the grouping and summing process, helping them see how different satisfaction levels contribute to the overall picture of passenger experience by class\r\n\r\n",
