I’m Sam, an engineer at Amazon, and today I’m excited to show you something really cool—our new AI Beat block in Music Lab!\r\n\r\nThis new block lets you create drum patterns with the help of AI. It’s like having your own virtual drummer that can jam along with you!\r\n\r\nHere’s how it works: You can start by drawing a simple drum pattern. The AI will then take your pattern and extend it, adding its own creative twist.\r\n\r\nEvery time you run the AI, it generates a different extension, so your beats will always sound fresh and unique. You can even see how adjusting the 'temperature' changes the way AI thinks—higher temperatures make it more adventurous, while lower ones keep it closer to your original idea.\r\n\r\nIt’s a fun way to explore how AI can collaborate with you to create music. You’ll be able to experiment, tweak, and perfect your beats just like a pro Music Producer!\r\n\r\nUnleash your creativity and let AI take your music to the next level. Who knows what amazing beats you’ll create today?",
