[From stories passed down through song, to protest anthems, from concert halls, to campfire sing-alongs]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHenny: Today, technology puts music at our fingertips. [ With one tap, you can listen to the latest song from an artist on the other side of the world.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHenny: Technology may have changed the way we share music, but it’s always been about human connection and finding your voice. Behind the scenes, there’s a whole world of people connecting you to music through technology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElapsed time: 28 seconds\r\nNext message: It takes a collaborative team using technology to make music accessible.\r\nChidi: \"Hi, I’m Chidi Anyadike and I’m a Senior Product Manager at Amazon Music. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChidi: I lead a team of engineers and designers to solve problems. We work together to improve the experience for people who listen to music on our app.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrlando: Hey, I’m Orlando Castillo and I’m a senior software engineer at Amazon Music. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrlando: I write the code that helps you discover your next favorite song or find new music you'll love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrayson: \"My name is Grayson Brown and I’m a UX Designer here at Amazon Music\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrayson: We come up with a design, from the color down to the buttons - to feel really cool and really fun and easy to use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHenny: All these people work together so that the music you love can reach you. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElapsed time: 63 sec\r\nNext message: You can create music using code, and you’re about to learn how.\r\nHenny: But how about making your own music? That’s what I do. I’m Henny the Bizness, and I’m a record producer.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHenny: A record producer is the person who brings the singers, the musicians, and the technology together to create a song from start to finish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHenny: I’ve worked with artists like Kendrick Lamar, Jay Z, and the Black Eyed Peas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHenny: Today, you’re going to learn to build your own song through coding, just like I do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElapsed time: 84 sec\r\nNext message: Coding and music are both about creating patterns and sequences. \r\nHenny: Think about your favorite song — every rhythm, every melody you hear is a series of sequences and patterns. That’s exactly what coding is about, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHenny: In Music Lab, you’ll use code blocks to match sounds together, make your own beats, and even remix famous songs into your own creation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHenny: When you’re done, don’t forget to share your song with your friends and family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHenny: Now it’s your turn to get started. Are you ready to make some awesome music with code? Let’s rock!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
