You’ll even have the chance to use parts of my songs to make your very own remix.\r\n\r\nDo you recognize this song? plays Wherever, Whenever \r\n\r\nWhat do you notice about the music? Are there different instruments? Do any parts of the song repeat? How does the song make you feel?\r\n\r\nOver the next hour, you’ll use code to help you take a song like mine and remix it. By the end of this tutorial, you’ll have all the skills you need to make your very own songs. \r\n\r\nWe even have a special guest that will help you make some new beats and melodies. \r\n\r\nLet’s hear what you create!\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/0585fc4855ddb6efc78ae1a2a06fb484-image-1723762281781.png)",
