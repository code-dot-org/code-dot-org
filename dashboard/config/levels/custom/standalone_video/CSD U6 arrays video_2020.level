Students should understand that arrays are intended to hold several pieces of information, usually all of the same type.  Just like any other piece of information, it needs to be assigned to a variable for a programmer to find it again.  Programmers can access each element of the array by its **index**, or its position number in the array.  Students will have a chance to practice the exact syntax in the lesson.",
