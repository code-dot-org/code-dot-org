Watch this video to get an overview of how to make sprites move in Game Lab.\r\n\r\n## Important Takeaways\r\n\r\n* The counter pattern allows the programmer to update the value of a variable in a pattern that counts up (or down) on every iteration of the draw loop.  \r\n* The counter pattern can be used for many different things, such as spinning, growing, shrinking, or timers, but it's most often used to move sprites across the screen.\r\n* When a sprite's x or y property is updated in a counter pattern, its position changes in a consistent way over time, causing it to move across the screen.  \r\n* Students should be able to explain that movement in an animation is just a change in position, and that changing a sprite's x position will cause it to move horizontally, and changing a sprite's y position will cause it to move vertically\r\n"
