I work with singers and musicians to capture sound inputs, like singing, instruments, and other noises. And to use Computer Science to produce the best final output. \r\n\r\nI’ve worked with artists like Kendrick Lamar, J Cole, Black Eyed Peas, Jay Z, and many others. \r\n\r\nWhen I find a sound I like, I decide how many times I want to loop that sound so it moves the music forward. Listen to this clip of Run DMC’s “Can’t Touch This.” \r\n\r\nDid you hear this part (plays “oh oh oh oh” clip)? If I repeat that same sound 15 times, I get the whole backup vocals for the chorus. And with this loop block, I don’t have to use the same block over and over again. I can just tell the computer how many times I want to loop this sound. \r\n\r\nNow you try. \r\n\r\nUse the loop block to repeat a sound over a long period of time.",
