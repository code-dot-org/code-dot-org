What questions will the `equals()` method raise for students given you don't need to define it in a subclass to use the method?\r\n\r\n## Want to know what else is in the `Object` class?  \r\nYou can read the documentation for the `Object` class from  <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html\" target=\"blank\">Oracle</a> to dig in a bit deeper!  You will notice the `toString()` method is also defined in the `Object` class. \r\n\r\n"
