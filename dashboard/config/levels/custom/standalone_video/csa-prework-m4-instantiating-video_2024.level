    "long_instructions": "So far we have been providing you some crucial code to get started in your programs.  This code instantiated a `Painter` object for you.  You need to instantiate, or create, objects to be able to call methods. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Example\r\nLet's look at an example of instantiating an object.\r\n\r\n```\r\n1. public class Drawing {\r\n2. \t\tpublic static void main(String[] args){\r\n3.\t\t\tPainter sara = new Painter();\r\n4. \t\t\tsara.move();\r\n5. \t\t\tsara.takePaint();\r\n6.\t\t}\r\n7. }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code above instantiates a new `Painter` object named `sara` on line 3. \r\n\r\n## Vocabulary\r\n\r\n* To **instantiate** an object is to call the constructor to create the object.\r\n* A **constructor** a block of code in a class that has the same name as the class and tells the computer how to create a new object.  It is called using the keyword `new`.\r\n\r\n## Syntax\r\nTo instantiate an object you will use the following syntax:\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/5d516fc936ce6161da065f1d106ef4a2-image-1673567861922.jpg)\r\n\r\nYou will learn more about constructors during your workshop, but for right now, know that a constructor is a block of code that has the same name as a class and is called using the keyword `new`.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind you can instantiate a many new objects in your code.  All of the following statements would create a `Painter` object:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1. Painter painterOne = new Painter();\r\n2. Painter ibrahim = new Painter();\r\n3. Painter kara = new Painter()\r\n\r\n```\r\nEach of these `Painter` objects will all be able to use the same methods or behaviors but the state of these objects may be different at any given time.  They might have different locations, be facing different directions, or may have a different amount of paint in their paint buckets.  However, they all will be able use the `move()`, `turnLeft()`, `paint()` or any other method included in the `Painter` class.\r\n\r\n## Watch to learn more\r\nAs you watch the video below, consider:\r\n\r\n* What are the attributes and behaviors of the `Painter` class you have noticed so far?\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n**Up next:** Practice using your knowledge of instantiating objects by debugging a program.\r\n\r\n"
