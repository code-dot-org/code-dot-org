While they should be familiar with how the model works with apps, there may still be questions around other computing devices, and around the examples shown later in the lesson.  For example, one common source of controversy around processing is whether some devices are processing information themselves, or whether the user is processing the information, while the device simply stores information (e.g. the abacus).",
