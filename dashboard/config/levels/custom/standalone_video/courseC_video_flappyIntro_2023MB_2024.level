In code, events allow user interaction, like the arrow button being clicked to cause a sprite to move.\r\n\r\n#### An event block is a block that, when triggered, causes a specific chunk of code to run. In Sprite Lab, these blocks are green. You will notice event blocks are not connected to the main section of your code.\r\n\r\n## Events with Flappy Bird\r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/365260b061905b3495f28eb1cbafcc92-image-1706655509364.58.24 PM.png\" alt=\"Image of the block code of an event handler\" width=\"350px\" style=\"border-radius:10px; float:right; margin: 0 0 0px 40px;\">\r\n\r\n#### Let’s take a look at coding with events. <b>Events </b> are actions that cause something to happen.
