In computer science, this is a **control structure called a loop**. \r\n\r\n##What are loops?\r\n\r\n####**Loops** are like repeating a set of instructions. Imagine stirring a pot of soup continuously until it's just right. In algorithms, loops let the computer do something **over and over again until a certain condition is met**. It's like saying, 'Keep doing this until I say stop.' You will practice using loops to build algorithms in the next levels.\r\n\r\n##To learn more about loops, watch the video below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
