As students are more comfortable with loops, more functionality will be introduced.  For now, students should know that they can use a for loop to repeat a segment of code multiple times.  The segment should go wherever in the program that code will be run.   (This aspect of loops is highlighted to keep students from treating loops like functions and placing them at the bottom of the code.)"
