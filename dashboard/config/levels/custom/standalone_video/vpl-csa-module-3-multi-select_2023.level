The image below shows which lessons include levels that have the opportunity to use The Theater in Unit 4.  The number of levels in the lesson using The Theater is noted in the circles. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/9e6df81e57932ae3b9577a1a9272ee90-image-1661976317095.03.59 PM.png\" alt=\"Calendar view of Unit 4\">\r\n\r\nThere are multiple but specific opportunities for students to engage with The Theater before using The Theater in the Unit 4 project.  Our goal in this series of workshops and modules is to help you understand these opportunities prior to doing these lessons with students. \r\n\r\n## Lesson 10 and The Theater\r\nIn this next section, you will engage in the first task from Unit 4, Lesson 10, where students will investigate and modify working code that uses a dataset and The Theater.  This mirrors a task that students will do in the Unit 4 project. \r\n\r\nFinally, lesson 10 uses multi-selection statements.  The video below will describe how multi-selection statements work. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n**Up next:** Investigate and modify a level from Lesson 10\r\n"
