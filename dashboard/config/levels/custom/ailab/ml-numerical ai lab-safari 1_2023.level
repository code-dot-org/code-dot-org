You should only train your model once you've investigated several of the features.\r\n\r\n\t- _The instructions when you click a numerical feature say:_ **Do This:** Follow the instructions on your activity guide. You should only train your model once you've investigated several of the features.\r\n\r\n\t- _The instructions when you click a categorical feature say:_ **Do This:** Follow the instructions on your activity guide. You should only train your model once you've investigated several of the features.\r\n\r\n- _The instructions for the **Results** screen say:_ **Do This:** Check the accuracy of your model and test a few examples. If you have at least 80% accuracy, press the Continue button. Otherwise, you can try again and keep retraining until you find an accurate model.\r\n\r\n\t- _The instructions when you click the details panel say:_ **Do This:** Check the accuracy of your model and test a few examples. If you have at least 80% accuracy, press the Continue button.
