If so, press the \"Add Feature\" button. If not, select a new column to explore. Repeat this until you've chosen several columns to use as features.\r\n\r\n- _The instructions for the **Results** screen say:_ **Do This:** Check the accuracy of your model and test a few examples. If you have at least 70% accuracy, press the Continue button. Otherwise, you can try again and keep retraining until you find an accurate model.\r\n\r\n\t- _The instructions when you click the details panel say:_ **Do This:** Check the accuracy of your model and test a few examples. If you have at least 70% accuracy, press the Continue button. Otherwise, you can try again and keep retraining until you find an accurate model.\r\n\r\n- _The instructions for the **Model Card** screen say:_ **Do This:** Fill out the Model Card information. The text for the Intended Use and Limitations and Warnings sections are provided on your activity guide. When you're finished, press the Save button.\r\n\r\n- _The instructions for the **Model Summary** screen say:_ We did it! You can see a summary of your model below!\r\n\r\n",
