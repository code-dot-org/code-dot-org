If there are any errors, you will need to fix them outside of AI Lab. Once you're ready, press the Continue button.\r\n\r\n\t- _The instructions when you click on a dataset say:_ You can see more information about this dataset on the right panel, including some potential investigations. Once you've found a dataset you like, press the Continue button.\r\n\r\n- _The instructions for the **Select Label** screen say:_ **Do This:** Select a column to use as a label, then press the Continue button.\r\n\r\n- _The instructions for the **Select Feature** screen say:_ **Do This:** Choose a column to investigate as a potential feature.\r\n\r\n\t- _The instructions when you click a numerical feature say:_ **Do This:** Decide if you would like to use this column as a feature. If so, press the \"Add Feature\" button. If not, select a new column to explore. Repeat this until you've chosen several columns to use as features.\r\n\r\n\t- _The instructions when you click a categorical feature say:_ **Do This:** Decide if you would like to use this column as a feature. If so, press the \"Add Feature\" button. If not, select a new column to explore. Repeat this until you've chosen several columns to use as features.\r\n\r\n- _The instructions for the **Results** screen say:_ **Do This:** If you're satisfied with the accuracy of your model, press the Continue button. Otherwise, you can try again and keep retraining until you find an accurate model.\r\n\r\n\t- _The instructions when you click the details panel say:_ **Do This:** If you're satisfied with the accuracy of your model, press the Continue button. Otherwise, you can try again and keep retraining until you find an accurate model.\r\n\r\n- _The instructions for the **Model Card** screen say:_ **Do This:** Fill out the Model Card information, then press the Save button.\r\n\r\n- _The instructions for the **Model Summary** screen say:_ We did it! You can see a summary of your model below!\r\n\r\n",
