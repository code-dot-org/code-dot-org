If such a block is found, the `makeAppointment` method calls the helper method `reserveBlock` to mark the minutes in the block as unavailable and returns `true`. If no such block is found, the `makeAppointment` method returns `false`. \r\n\r\nConsider the following list of unavailable and available minutes in periods 2, 3, and 4 and three successive calls to `makeAppointment`.\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/d6367e5f3ee84f54e6989c1c9628db08-image-1687355868949.57.38 AM.png)\r\n\r\nThe method call `makeAppointment(2, 4, 22)` returns `true` and results in the minutes 5 through 26, inclusive, in period 4 being marked as unavailable. \r\n\r\nThe method call `makeAppointment(3, 4, 3)` returns `true` and results in the minutes 0 through 2, inclusive, in period 3 being marked as unavailable. \r\n\r\nThe method call `makeAppointment(2, 4, 30)` returns `false`, since there is no block of 30 available minutes in periods 2, 3, or 4. \r\n\r\nThe following shows the updated list of unavailable and available minutes in periods 2, 3, and 4 after the three example method calls are complete.\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/a45bca2d9d080f3fcd2a5b83405bbff4-image-1687355820943.56.53 AM.png)\r\n\r\nComplete method `makeAppointment`.
