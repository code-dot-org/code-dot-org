Your program should demonstrate the object-oriented programming and software engineering skills and knowledge you have developed throughout the year.\r\n\r\nUse your knowledge of object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms to create an animation using The Theater:\r\n\r\n* **Use inheritance and polymorphism** â€“ Create a superclass that represents shared attributes and behaviors with at least two subclasses that are more specific versions or variations of the superclass.\r\n\r\n* **Method decomposition** â€“ Use overloaded, overridden, and <code style=\"background-color: #ececec; color: black; font-weight: bold;\">private</code> methods to implement different versions of the same behavior, variations of a superclass behavior, and to improve code organization.\r\n\r\n* **Use at least two data structures** â€“ Use at least two 1D or 2D arrays or <code style=\"background-color: #ececec; color: black; font-weight: bold;\">ArrayList</code>s to store elements that are manipulated using loops and conditionals.\r\n\r\n* **Implement one or more algorithms** â€“ Implement one or more algorithms that use two-way or multi-selection statements and loops with compound Boolean expressions to analyze the data.\r\n\r\n* **Create a visualization** â€“ Create an animation that portrays a personal interest or solves a problem that you choose using objects, data structures, and methods.\r\n\r\n* **Document your code** â€“ Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.",
