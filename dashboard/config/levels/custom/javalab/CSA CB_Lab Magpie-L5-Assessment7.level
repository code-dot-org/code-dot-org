One possible\r\nprogramming assignment is to have students pick a domain (like Northeast’s student government\r\nor Central High School football) and create a Magpie that can speak with confidence about it. For\r\nexample, if the student government president’s name is used, the Magpie can recognize that the\r\nperson is the president and it can respond to specific school issues, like recognizing the theme of the\r\nprom.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if a more structured input format is required, much more domain knowledge can be\r\nused. Consider a program that can respond to geometric questions like:\r\n* What is the area of a circle with diameter 7?\r\n* What is the circumference of a square with side 3?\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the program can respond to questions about state capitals, help with language\r\ntranslation, etc.",
