The frog attempts to hop to a goal within a specified number of hops. The simulation is encapsulated in the following `FrogSimulation` class. You will write two of the methods in this class.\r\n\r\nWrite the `simulate` method, which simulates the frog attempting to hop in a straight line to a goal from the frog's starting position of `0` within a maximum number of hops. The method returns `true` if the frog successfully reached the goal within the maximum number of hops; otherwise, the method returns `false`. \r\n\r\nThe `FrogSimulation` class provides a method called `hopDistance` that returns an integer representing the distance (positive or negative) to be moved when the frog hops. A positive distance represents a move toward the goal. A negative distance represents a move away from the goal. The returned distance may vary from call to call. Each time the frog hops, its position is adjusted by the value returned by a call to the `hopDistance` method. \r\n\r\nThe frog hops until one of the following conditions becomes `true`:\r\n* The frog has reached or passed the goal. \r\n* The frog has reached a negative position. \r\n* The frog has taken the maximum number of hops without reaching the goal. \r\n\r\nThe following example shows a declaration of a `FrogSimulation` object for which the goal distance is 24 inches and the maximum number of hops is 5. The table shows some possible outcomes of calling the `simulate` method.\r\n\r\n`FrogSimulation sim = new FrogSimulation(24, 5);`\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/d60e5132f45e5abecddc7ff5214bcd8d-image-1688486434877.00.32 PM.png)\r\n\r\nComplete method `simulate` below. You must use `hopDistance` appropriately to receive full credit.",
