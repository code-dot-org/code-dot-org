A level in the game is represented by the `Level` class. \r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class Level \r\n{ \r\n\t/** Returns true if the player reached the goal on this level and returns false otherwise */ \r\n    public boolean goalReached() \r\n    { /* implementation not shown */ } \r\n    \r\n    /** Returns the number of points (a positive integer) recorded for this level */ \r\n    public int getPoints() \r\n    { /* implementation not shown */ } \r\n    \r\n    // There may be instance variables, constructors, and methods that are not shown. \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlay of the game is represented by the `Game` class. You will write two methods of the `Game` class. \r\n\r\nWrite the `getScore` method, which returns the score for the most recently played game. Each game consists of three levels. The score for the game is computed using the following helper methods. \r\n* The `isBonus` method of the `Game` class returns `true` if this is a bonus game and returns `false` otherwise. \r\n* The `goalReached` method of the `Level` class returns `true` if the goal has been reached on a particular level and returns `false` otherwise. \r\n* The `getPoints` method of the `Level` class returns the number of points recorded on a particular level. Whether or not recorded points are earned (included in the game score) depends on the rules of the game, which follow. \r\n\r\nThe score for the game is computed according to the following rules. \r\n* Level one points are earned only if the level one goal is reached. Level two points are earned only if both the level one and level two goals are reached. Level three points are earned only if the goals of all three levels are reached. \r\n* The score for the game is the sum of the points earned for levels one, two, and three. \r\n* If the game is a bonus game, the score for the game is tripled.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows some examples of game score calculations.\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/1d680afe5a0733cd6c540a447496a85c-image-1687366227153.49.43 PM.png)\r\n\r\nComplete the `getScore` method.",
