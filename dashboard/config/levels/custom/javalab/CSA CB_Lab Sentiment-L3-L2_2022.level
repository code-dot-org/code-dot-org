Using the Java Lab editor, compile the adjective lists into the two separate text files that are present in the editor window:\r\n\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  `positiveAdjectives.txt` should contain all the identified positive adjectives.\r\n\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  `negativeAdjectives.txt` should contain all the identified negative adjectives.\r\n\r\n2. Open your existing `SimpleReview.txt` file and annotate each adjective by adding a \" * \" at the beginning of the word. For example, the `SimpleReview.txt` from Activity 2 would be:\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was a ***terrible** restaurant! The pizza crust was too ***chewy**, and I disliked the pasta. I would definitely not come back.",
