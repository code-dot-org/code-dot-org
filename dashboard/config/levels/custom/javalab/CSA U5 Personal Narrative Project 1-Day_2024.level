When combined into collages and presentations, these images tell a story about who we are and what is important to us. Your goal is to create a personal narrative using The Theater that consists of images of your personal experiences and/or interests, incorporates data related to these experiences and/or interests that can be organized in a 2D array, and uses image filters and effects to change or enhance the mood of your images.\r\n\r\nUse your knowledge of object-oriented programming, two-dimensional (2D) arrays, and algorithms to create your personal narrative collage or animation:\r\n\r\n* **Create at least two 2D arrays** – Create at least two 2D arrays to store the data that will make up your visualization.\r\n\r\n* **Implement one or more algorithms** – Implement one or more algorithms that use loops and two-way or multi-selection statements with compound Boolean expressions to analyze the data.\r\n\r\n* **Use methods in the String class** – Use one or more methods in the <code style=\"background-color: #ececec; color: black; font-weight: bold;\">String</code> class in your program, such as to determine whether the name of an image file contains specific characters.\r\n\r\n* **Create a visualization** – Create an image or animation that conveys the story of the data by illustrating the patterns or relationships in the data.\r\n\r\n* **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.",
