Your goal is to create a store management system for your business.\r\n\r\n✅ **TO DO:** Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming and class structure and design to create your store management system:\r\n\r\n1. **Create a class hierarchy** – Develop a superclass that represents a product or service your business offers and one or more subclasses that extend the superclass to represent more specific types of products or services.\r\n\r\n2. **Declare instance variables** – Declare instance variables in the superclass that are shared with the subclasses and instance variables in the subclasses that are not shared with the superclass.\r\n\r\n3. **Constructors** – Write no-argument and parameterized constructors in the superclass and subclasses. Subclass constructors use the <code style=\"background-color: #ececec; color: black; font-weight: bold;\">super</code> keyword as appropriate to call the superclass constructor.\r\n\r\n4. **Implement accessor and mutator methods** – Write accessor and mutator methods for instance variables that should be accessible and/or modifiable from outside of the class.\r\n\r\n5. **Implement a <code style=\"background-color: #ececec; color: black; font-weight: bold;\">toString()</code> method** – Write <code style=\"background-color: #ececec; color: black; font-weight: bold;\">toString()</code> methods in the superclass and subclasses that return information about the state of an object.",
