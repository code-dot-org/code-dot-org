External style sheets are separate files that are linked to the HTML page.\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**What is CSS?**]\r\n\r\nCSS is a language that controls the way content on a web site appears.  It uses rule-sets to change the look of a page.  Each rule set has a selector, which specifies which elements on the page will be affected, and the rules, which explain how to display the elements.   Each rule consists of a property and a value for that property.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere’s an example of a rule-set that makes the text in an `h2` tag blue and cursive:\r\n\r\n```\r\nh2 {\r\n   color: blue;\r\n   font-family: cursive;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, `h2` is the selector, `color` and `font-family` are properties, and `blue` and `cursive` are the values for those properties.\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**How do I create a new style sheet?**]\r\nTo create a new style sheet, click on the \"Add CSS\" button above the code area.\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**What should I name my style sheet?**]\r\nYou can name your style sheet anything, but it's better to choose a relevant name, such as \"style.css\" or \"aboutmestyles.css\" so that it's clear what the file is.  Your file should always end in the \".css\" extension.\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**How do I rename a file?**]\r\nTo rename a file, you can right click (or control click) on the file name and choose the \"Rename\" option.  This will allow you to type in a new file name.  Clicking on a file name after it is already highlighted will also allow you to rename the file.\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**How do I add a style sheet to a web page?**]\r\n\r\nTo add a style sheet to a web page, open up the code for the web page.  Inside the head tag, add the following code `<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"style.css\">`.  Then change \"style.css\" to the name of your style sheet.\r\n\r\n\r\n:::\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n# Style this page!\r\nHere is an opportunity to be creative and have some fun with styles.\r\n\r\n \r\n # Do this\r\n * Link the stylesheet to the web page.\r\n * Make the paragraph text a different size.\r\n * Make the paragraph text a different color.\r\n",
