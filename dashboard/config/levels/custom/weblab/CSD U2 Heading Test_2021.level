Paragraphs in HTML can be any length of text from one word to a bunch of sentences. All of your text in your web page should be contained in an HTML element (headings or paragraphs). Paragraphs group together sets of sentences and put some space between that group of text and the next group of text.\r\n\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**How do I create multiple paragraphs?**]\r\n\r\nParagraphs are marked by opening (`<p>`) and closing (`</p>`) tags as well. To create more than one paragraph you will want multiple sets of opening and closing `<p>` tags. For example\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n        This is a paragraph.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        This is another paragraph.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**What are headings?**]\r\nHeadings are the different sized section titles throughout a web page. Headings add structure to your web page by breaking it up so it's easier for a user to read.\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**How do I make different sized headings?**]\r\nHeadings come in 6 different sizes. So far you have primarily used the biggest one `<h1>`. The number 1 in the HTML tag designates that this is the biggest heading. The smallest heading is `<h6>`. You can also try the `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, and `<h5>` tags which get smaller as the number gets larger.\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**What is HTML?**]\r\nHTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is used to add structure to the content of a web page. HTML uses tags to specify where certain structures start and end. These tags are sets of characters not found in the English language so that the content and structure can be differentiated. \r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**What is an HTML element?**]\r\nAn HTML element is a piece of a website that is marked by a start tag and sometimes closed with an end tag. The element also includes the content inside the tags. For example: \r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/fb4df62aa4d879f7021c567be2e28eea-image-1481135855001.png\" style=\"width:500px\">\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**What is an HTML tag?**]\r\n\r\nAn HTML tag is the special set of characters that tells the machine where the start or end of an HTML element is and what type it is.\r\n\r\n\r\n:::\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nThe author of this page added in a lot of content, but did not think about structure.  All of the text is mashed together.\r\n\r\nDo This:\r\n* Look through the content with your partner and decide what you think the best structure should be.\r\n* Use your heading and paragraph tags to code the structure into the page.\r\n",
