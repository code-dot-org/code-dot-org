Here are my top 3 favorites:</p>\\n    <ol>\\n    <li>Settlers of Catan</li>\\n    <p>One of my favorites is Settlers of Catan. It's a relatively simple game that can accommodate up to 6 players</p>\\n    <li>Blukus</li>\\n    <p>Blokus is a game of spatial reasoning and problem-solving, so everyone's mind gets a workout!</p>\\n    <li>Azul</li>\\n    <p>This is a fun, creative game where players take turns drafting colored tiles from suppliers to their player board. Later, players score points based on how they've placed their tiles to decorate the palace</p>\\n    <h2>Fishing</h2>\\n    <p. My dad really likes fishing because he thinks it is calming, although it might be a little boring. He says \\\"It's called fishing, not catching\\\"</p\\n    <h2>Going outside</h2>\\n    <p>Sometimes you just need to get some fresh air and enjoy the outside. Whether that's going to a local park or driving to a trail to go on a hike.</p>\\n  </body>\\n</html>\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"style.css\",\r\n      \"data\": \"\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n            ",
