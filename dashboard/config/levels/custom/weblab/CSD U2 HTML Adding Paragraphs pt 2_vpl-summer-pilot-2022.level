Paragraphs in HTML can be any length of text from one word to a bunch of sentences. Paragraphs group together sets of sentences and put some space between that group of text and the next group of text.\r\n\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**How do I make multiple paragraphs?**]\r\n\r\nHere's an example of several paragraph tags in a row. This code would be placed inside of the body of your web page.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<p>This is a paragraph. It has two sentences.</p>\r\n<p>This is another paragraph.</p>\r\n```\r\n\r\n:::\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n# Use Paragraph Tags\r\n\r\nThe `<p>` `</p>` tags or \"paragraph\" start and end tags are placed around text to indicate that it is part of a paragraph. Placing text between paragraph start and end tags lets the computer know that it should be treated differently, often just spacing it out from other text.\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\n* Place the text you just wrote inside at least two separate paragraphs by surrounding it with `<p>` and `</p>` tags\r\n* Compare the results with a neighbor. What has changed about the way your text is displayed?",
