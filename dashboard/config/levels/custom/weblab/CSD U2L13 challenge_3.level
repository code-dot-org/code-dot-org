Find the \"gallery\" container.\r\n2. Add a `div` container with the class attribute \"image-card\" for all \"image-cards.\" \r\n3. Add a `div` container with the class attribute \"image\" for all images.\r\n4. Add a `div` container with the class attribute \"info\" for all paragraphs of information. \r\n\r\n**_The `div` tags for the first \"image-card\", \"image\" and \"info\" one has been done for you._**\r\n:::\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n::: details [**In the CSS file:**]\r\n1. Establish Flex layout and \"wrap\" for the \"gallery\" container.\r\n2. Set the content of the \"image-card\" to grow at a value of 1 so they all grow at the same rate.\r\n3. Establish Flex layout for the \"image-card\" so that its child elements can use Flex too\r\n4. Set the \"info\" container content to align itself to the center.\r\n\r\n:::\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n::: details [**EXTRA CHALLENGE**]\r\nCan you figure out how to set the order of the \"image-card\" for the giant squid to be the first image in the gallery, just like the image above?\r\n\r\n_Hint: You will probably have to give the \"image-card\" a different class attribute in order to set its order!_\r\n:::\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n_Make sure you click on the \"expand\" icon often to see the web page in full screen._ <br><img src=\"https://images.code.org/567dfb99176eca65ae2f69fd18c22448-image-1707239268931.png\" style=\"width: 250px;\">\r\n\r\n![]()",

Covering more than 70% of our planet's surface, the ocean is a colossal expanse, yet we have explored less than 5% of its hidden depths.
