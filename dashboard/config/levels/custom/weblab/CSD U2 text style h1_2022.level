You can see a full list of CSS color names at <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp\" target=\"_new\">W3Schools - HTML Color Names</a>.  You can still use colors that are not included in the named list, but you will need to use their RGB values.  You can read more about using colors in CSS at <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors_legal.asp\" target=\"_new\">W3Schools - CSS Legal Color Values</a>\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**How does the code work?**]\r\n\r\nHere is the code that is making the `h1` heading red:\r\n\r\n```\r\nh1 {\r\n  color: red;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n* `h1` is the _selector_.  It specifies which elements will have to follow the rules inside the curly braces.\r\n* `color: red;` is the rule that makes the text inside the `h1` tags red.\r\n  * `color` is the _property_.  It explains what the rule is about, in this case the text color.\r\n  * `red` is the _value_.  It explains how the rule should be applied, in this case making the text red.\r\n\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**Why do I need all the punctuation?**]\r\n\r\nThe punctuation, such as the curly braces `{}`, the colon `:`, and the semicolon `;`, help the computer to understand the rules in the style sheet.  The curly braces hold all the rules for a particular selector.  Each rule should end in a semicolon, and the properties and values are always separated by a colon.\r\n\r\n:::\r\n::: details [**What is a style sheet?**]\r\n\r\nA style sheet is a document that controls how a web page will appear.  External style sheets are separate files that are linked to the HTML page.\r\n\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**What is CSS?**]\r\nCSS is a language that controls the way content on a web site appears.  It uses rule-sets to change the look of a page.  Each rule set has a selector, which specifies which elements on the page will be affected, and the rules, which explain how to display the elements.   Each rule consists of a property and a value for that property.\r\n\r\nHere’s an example of a rule-set that makes the text in an `h2` tag blue and cursive:\r\n\r\n```\r\nh2 {\r\n   color: blue;\r\n   font-family: cursive;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, `h2` is the selector, `color` and `font-family` are properties, and `blue` and `cursive` are the values for those properties.\r\n:::\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n# CSS and Text Color\r\n\r\nThis HTML file uses a style sheet (\"style.css\") to give the page a particular style.  The style sheet contains information about what each of the HTML elements should look like.\r\n\r\n# Do this\r\n\r\n* Find the code in the style sheet (click on \"style.css\" in the files list) that is making the h1 heading red.\r\n* Change the code for the color of the h1 heading from `red` to a different color.",
