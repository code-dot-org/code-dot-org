I feed them and give them water every day, and even though it's a lot of work, they are totally worth it.\\n    \\n    Lula\\n\\n    Lula's been my dog for two years, and she's really fun to play with.  I like to take her to the park.  Her favorite toy is an old tennis ball.\\n    \\n    Slowpoke\\n\\n    Slowpoke is my turtle.  I have had him for as long as I can remember, but he became mine for real when I turned 10 because I promised to take care of him.\\n\\n    Hamster\\n\\n    Hamster is the name of my fish.  I named him hamster because I wanted a hamster and not a fish, but I like him anyway.  He basically just swims around all day, but I still like him.\\n\\n  </body>\\n</html>\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n            ",
