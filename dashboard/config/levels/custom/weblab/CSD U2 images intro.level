The attribute `src` stands for **s**ou**rc**e and tell the name of the image. Image files names include extensions which tell the computer which type of image they are working with. Common extensions are .jpg, .jpeg, .png. <br><br>\r\n\r\nIn addition to have the src attribute, image elements also have the `alt` attribute which describe the image. This is important in case the image doesnâ€™t load or for people who have trouble with their eyesight. <br><br>\r\n\r\nAn `<img>` tag is an example of a  **void element** because it starts and closes in one tag. To mark this we put the `/` which usually goes in the close tag at the end of the image tag.\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>\n\n**What is a void tag?**\n\n</summary>\r\nAn `<img>` tag is an example of a  **void element** because it starts and closes in one tag. To mark this we put the `/` which usually goes in the close tag at the end of the image tag. Void tags do not need a closing tag because there is no text content which must be wrapped in tags. The content that shows on the screen is specified through the tags attributes.\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>\n\n**Why does an image tag not have a closing tag?**\n\n</summary>\r\nAn image tag is a void tag and void tags do not need a closing tag because there is no text content which must be wrapped in tags. The content that shows on the screen is specified through the tags attributes.\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>\n\n**What is an attribute?**\n\n</summary>\n\nAttributes are extra information included in a tag.  Attributes have names and values. The name tells what type of information is being provided and then the value gives the specific information for that tag. \r\n\r\nFor example &lt;img&gt; tags have two attributes, src and alt. src specifies the name of the image file and alt tells the browser in readable text what the image is.\r\n\n\n</details>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nThe recipe page would look a lot better with a picture of the scotcheroos, so we added one onto this page.  It might look better somewhere else on the page, though.\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n* Look at the file list on the left of your workspace, and find the file named \"scotcheroos.jpeg\"\r\n* Use the inspector tool to find the code that made the image appear on the page.\r\n* Make sure you and your partner agree on how the image tag works.\r\n* Try to move the picture to the top of the page.",
