A heading is a short piece of text that goes at the top of a section of content, like a title.\r\n\r\nStudents will go on to learn that headings come in 6 different sizes. The most common heading is `<h1>`. The number 1 in the HTML tag designates that this is the biggest heading. The smallest heading is `<h6>`.\r\n\r\n# Do This:\r\n\r\n1) Find the headings in the web page below and use the Inspector Tool to see the code that makes them.\r\n2) Take a minute to think about what the different heading tags do.\r\n3) Change the code so that \"Drawing\" and \"2 years\" match the headings on the rest of the page.\r\n\r\n::: details [**Show Me How**]\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/f98617a07b46476bc721e8c1124b2515-image-1677103360748.gif\" style=\"width:500px\">\r\n\r\n**More resources are in the \"Help and Tips\" tab**\r\n:::\r\n\r\n![]()",
