You will know that the Inspector Tool is on because the button will turn white and say \"Inspector: On\".\r\n- Once you turn on the Inspector Tool, you can hover over anything in the preview area and Web Lab will highlight the code that is making that part of the page appear. Notice that some parts of the code have special `< >` markers surrounding the words\r\n- Use the inspector tool and try to determine which `< >` code create the following effects on the website:\r\n\t- What code makes the text bigger and bolder?\r\n    - What code makes text appear as a list?\r\n    - What code makes the text appear on separate lines?\r\n    - What's a piece of code that doesn't appear to do anything on the screen?\r\n\r\n![]()",
