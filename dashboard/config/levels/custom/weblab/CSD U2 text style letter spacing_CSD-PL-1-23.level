With not enough light, it can look like the orchid is growing great, but will not bloom flowers. So give your orchid light.\\n  </p>\\n  \\n  <h3>Watering Orchids</h3>\\n  \\n  <p> \\n    Improper watering is probably the top reason orchids die. Unfortunately, there is no one trick solves all when it comes to watering an orchid. Depending on where you live will affect how much you water your orchid. The only advice is to water the orchid right as it starts to dry out. How do you know when it's drying out? Some tips to help is to see if the top of the potting mixture is dry. Also if dry it will be lighter than when watered. And if all else fails, you can put your finger or a stick into the potting mixture to check if the potting mixture is moist or not.\\n  </p> \\n\\n  <h3>Should I Fertilize?</h3>\\n  \\n  <p>\\n    If you want to fertilize your orchid, make sure to choose a fertilizer with little or no urea in it because an orchid cannot use urea that well. And then if you do get fertilizer, use it once per week in the summer and then once every two weeks in the winter and fall.\\n  </p> \\n</body>\\n</html>\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"style.css\",\r\n      \"data\": \"/* 2) Change the code for the h2 tag so that the letters are spaced out by two pixels */\\n/* 3) Change the letter spacings of the paragraph and h3 tags */\\nh1 {\\n  color: lightpink;\\n  letter-spacing: 5px;\\n  text-align: center;\\n}\\n\\nh2 {\\n  color:lawngreen;\\n  text-align: center;\\n}\\n\\nh3 {\\n  text-align:center; \\n}\\n\\np {\\n  font-size: 14px;\\n  text-align: center;\\n}\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n            ",
