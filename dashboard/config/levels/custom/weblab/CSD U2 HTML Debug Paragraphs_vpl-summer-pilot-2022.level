Paragraphs in HTML can be any length of text from one word to a bunch of sentences. Paragraphs group together sets of sentences and put some space between that group of text and the next group of text.\r\n\r\n:::\r\n::: details [**Why does HTML seem to work even when it's broken?**]\r\nHTML is read by your web browser to generate web pages. Since people often make little mistakes when writing their web pages, browsers are programmed to make a best guess of what you intended to do. Sometimes different browsers are even programmed to make different guesses! The only way to ensure your code looks like you intend is make sure you're always using tags correctly.\r\n\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**Why does the code sometimes turn pink?**]\r\n\r\nWeb Lab is programmed to automatically detect some mistakes in HTML.  When it notices a mistake, it turns that code pink.  The mistake might be in pink, or it might be somewhere before the pink code.  You'll need to carefully debug to find your mistake.\r\n\r\n:::\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n# Debug: Fix the Broken Tags\r\n\r\nThis simple web page has some issues which are preventing the content from being displayed correctly. Identify and fix the issues. This practice is also called \"debugging\" your code.\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\n* Fix the broken code so that the web page displays correctly\r\n* Compare the problems you fixed with a neighbor",

This is a central skill that students will develop throughout the course.  Emphasize that debugging is a normal part of the programming process, and that all programmers, even experts get bugs.  More information can be found in the \"Debugging Guide\" linked at on the CS Discoveries curriculum page at https://curriculum.code.org/csd."
