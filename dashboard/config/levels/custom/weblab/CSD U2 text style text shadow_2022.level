The first value is how much the shadow will be shifted horizontal and the second value will be how much the shadow will be shifted vertically. And if you want, you can change the color along with other properties. Read more about it at <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_text-shadow.asp\" target=\"_new\">W3Schools - CSS text-shadow Property</a>\r\n\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**What does `px` mean / What is a pixel?**]\r\n\r\nPixel, which is abbreviated `px`, is how elements are measured in CSS.  It’s the size of a single point of light on the screen.\r\n\r\n\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**Why doesn't <code>text-shadow: 0px 0px;</code> do anything?**]\r\n\r\nMost properties have default values.  The default values are the styles that an element will have automatically, before you add your style sheet.  The default value for `text-shadow` is `0px 0px`, so it doesn't change from how it already looked.\r\n\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**What are the possible values for text shadow??**]\r\n\r\nYou can choose between negative and positive numbers. Negative numbers move the shadow either left or up while positive numbers move the shadow to the right or down.\r\n\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**Why do I need all the punctuation?**]\r\n\r\nThe punctuation, such as the curly braces `{}`, the colon `:`, and the semicolon `;`, help the computer to understand the rules in the style sheet.  The curly braces hold all the rules for a particular selector.  Each rule should end in a semicolon, and the properties and values are always separated by a colon.\r\n\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**What is a style sheet?**]\r\n\r\nA style sheet is a document that controls how a web page will appear.  External style sheets are separate files that are linked to the HTML page.\r\n\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**What is CSS?**]\r\n\r\nCSS is a language that controls the way content on a web site appears.  It uses rule-sets to change the look of a page.  Each rule set has a selector, which specifies which elements on the page will be affected, and the rules, which explain how to display the elements.   Each rule consists of a property and a value for that property.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nHere’s an example of a rule-set that makes the text in an `h2` tag blue and cursive:\r\n\r\n```\r\nh2 {\r\n   color: blue;\r\n   font-family: cursive;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, `h2` is the selector, `color` and `font-family` are properties, and `blue` and `cursive` are the values for those properties.\r\n:::\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n# Text Shadow\r\n\r\nThe `text-shadow` property sets a shadow for the text elements.\r\n\r\n* Find the CSS code that is giving the letters in \"Stradivarius Violins\" a shadow in the `h1` tag.\r\n* Give the `h2` tag a shadow spaced two pixels to the right and up from the original text.\r\n* Give a text shadow to other tags as well.\r\n",

But why? What makes them so different from violins created today?\\r\\n  <h3>\\r\\n    Some History\\r\\n  <\\/h3>\\r\\n  <p>\\r\\n    A Stradivarius actually refers to a collection of string instruments  such as violins, violas, cellos, harps and others. Called Strads for short, they were made between the 17th and 18th century by the Stradivari family, but most well known member is Antonio Stradivari.\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n  <h3>Is it Even Worth it?<\\/h3>\\r\\n  <p> \\r\\n    The truth is, Strads do not sound that much different than violins created today. In studies with professional violinists, it was shown that the professionals could not really tell the difference between a Strad and a much newer violin. \\r\\n  <\\/p> \\r\\n\\r\\n  <h3>So Why?<\\/h3>\\r\\n  <p>\\r\\n    So why spend millions of dollars for a violin that sounds just like other violins then? Well, some people deem Strads to be a strong part of history. So many famous historical figures, from royalty to other composers, have held and played these instruments. Many times, historical pieces of like art can sell for millions, and these instruments are no different. They are historical and beautiful, so when you have a Strad, it's not just about the beautiful sound, but also all the stories it carries with it.\\r\\n  <\\/p> \\r\\n<\\/body>\\r\\n<\\/html>  \\r\\n\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n",
