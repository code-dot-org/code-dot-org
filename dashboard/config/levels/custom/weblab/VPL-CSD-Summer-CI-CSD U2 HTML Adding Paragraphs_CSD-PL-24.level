As students add content to their projects, they'll need to do it between the `<body>` and `</body>` tags because it should be part of the body of your webpage.\r\n\r\nThe `<p>` `</p>` tags or \"paragraph\" start and end tags are placed around text to indicate that it is part of a paragraph. Placing text between paragraph start and end tags lets the computer know that it should be treated differently, often just pacing it out from other text.\r\n\r\nA student, Sofia, has already started adding text to her webpage. She started to add paragraph tags so each sentence would appear on its own line, but hasn't finished.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/391e34e673c238090ce87c314b3fdd7e-weblab-inspector.gif\" style=\"width:300px; float:right; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;\">\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\n1) Finish adding `<p>` and `</p>` tags to Sofia's code so each sentence appears on a separate line\r\n- Use the Inspector tool to verify that each line appears on its own\r\n\r\n::: details [**Show Me How**]\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/cdc75459cb46bd58d5af50df0ca56e3d-image-1677101838977.gif\" style=\"width:500px\" alt=\"A gif showing how to place text in a paragraph.\">\r\n:::",
