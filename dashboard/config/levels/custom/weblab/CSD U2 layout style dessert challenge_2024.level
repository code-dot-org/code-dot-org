They can take on all different shapes and forms with incredibly differing tastes. And each one is unique and special in its own and deserves to be learned about and hopefully one day tasted. <\\/h5>\\r\\n    <h2>Here Are Some Desserts<\\/h2>\\r\\n    <h1>Tiramisu<\\/h1>\\r\\n    <p>Tiramisu is an Italian dessert whose name means \\\"pick me up\\\" or \\\"cheer me up\\\". Originally it is made with finger biscuits, egg yolks, coffee, sugar, cocoa powder, and mascarpone. The biscuits are dipped into the coffee and the mixed between the othe rincredients all whipped together.  But over time, there have been variations of it too. Most claim that tiramisu originated in the 1960s in Venato, Italy. However, it did not become a huge hit in the United States until the 1990s.  \\/p>\\r\\n    <img src=\\\"tiramisu.jpg\\\"\\r\\n         alt=\\\"Tiramisu\\\">\\r\\n    <h6>Andrey Cojocaru, Pixabay, Pixabay License<\\/h6>\\r\\n    \\r\\n    \\r\\n    <h1>Chinese Egg Tarts<\\/h1>\\r\\n    <p>Egg tarts are a very famous Chinese dessert, but can also be found in many other countries around the world like Portugal and Brazil. All the dessert is just a pastry crust with an egg custard filling that is then just baked. Egg tarts most likely started out in the city of GuangZhou in China drawing inspiration from the European custard tart. And over time it's become a big hit.<\\/p>\\r\\n    <img src=\\\"egg_tarts.jpg\\\"\\r\\n         alt=\\\"Egg tarts\\\">\\r\\n    <h6>See-ming Lee, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 2.0<\\/h6>\\r\\n  <\\/body>\\r\\n<\\/html>\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"egg_tart.jpg\",\r\n      \"url\": \"https://images.code.org/23f8df3653d832a6e2cf02a57d7fa3f2-image-1566597542710.jpg\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"tiramisu.jpg\",\r\n      \"url\": \"https://images.code.org/b1b1c8bf290cb34cb587c15145f51130-image-1566597591800.jpg\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}",
