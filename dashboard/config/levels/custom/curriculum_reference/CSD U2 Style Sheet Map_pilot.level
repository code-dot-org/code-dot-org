While they have previously been using HTML tags to label and categorize their content, they're now learning how to control the style of the different elements in their page using CSS. Students may have some misconceptions at this point since their browser has used default styles for their different kinds of content (e.g. `<h1>` tags by default make text larger). As they move through these lessons they should come to see that tagging content really just allows the browser's default styles, or the styles they define using CSS, to be applied to the correct pieces of content in their web pages.\r\n\r\nSome students may also be confused by the fact that \"Content-Structure-Style\" and \"Cascading Style Sheets\" have the same initial letters.  CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and refers to the language they will use to style their content.  Content-structure-style is a paradigm that they use to separate out the different information that the browser needs to render a page, but should not be abbreviated \"C-S-S\", to avoid confusion.",
