In the case of an inside joke, it would mean explaining not only the situation that led to the joke, but all of the ways the joke has been built-up over time. Or in the case of a phrase like “Semper Fi”, it may seem impossible because the chatbot is unable to “live through” the experiences required to relate to other marine corps veterans who use the phrase. Emphasize that even if this were possible, it would require more than just the system prompting and retrieval we’ve been using.",
