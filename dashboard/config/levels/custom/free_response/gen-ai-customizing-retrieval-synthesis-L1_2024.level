My job involves spreading awareness about environmental issues and coordinating community involvement in our local initiatives. It's all about communicationâ€”crafting messages that resonate with people and organizing events that bring our community together for a good cause.\r\n\r\n### Why I'm Here\r\nI'm leading a project to get more people involved in our local cleanup efforts. Litter is a big issue in our city, ruining the look of our public spaces and harming our environment. I think using technology could really help make our cleanup events more fun and easy to join, especially if people can use it to find upcoming events. A chatbot could be a real game-changer, giving us a direct way to teach people about the bad effects of litter and empowering them to do something about it. By using this chatbot in our campaigns, I want to change the way our community gets involved with our environmental programs, making it simpler and more interesting for everyone to help make our city healthier and more sustainable.\r\n\r\n**Defining the Problem:** There is low community engagement in environmental initiatives, and people are not well-informed about the negative impacts of littering.\r\n\r\n> We've been asked to help develop a chatbot for this person. Before diving in, let's take a moment to **Prepare** and plan how we can develop this chatbot\r\n> \r\n> 1) How could we use a **System Prompt** when making the chatbot? What parts of this problem is a System Prompt most helpful for?\r\n> 1) How could we use **Retrieval** when making the chatbot? What parts of this problem is Retrieval most helpful for?",
