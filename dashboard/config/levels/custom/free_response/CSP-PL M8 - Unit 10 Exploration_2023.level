It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect.

How much math do students need to understand to be able to meet the learning objectives in this lesson?\r\n##### 2. In each of these lessons, math plays a role.  Students with strong math backgrounds will likely participate differently than students without strong math backgrounds. What are some ways students without strong math backgrounds can contribute intellectually to this lesson?\r\n",
