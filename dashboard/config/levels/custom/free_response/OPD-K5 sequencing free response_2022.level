The \"driver\" writes code while the \"navigator\" directs the design and setup of the code.  The two programmers switch roles often.  \r\n\r\n**Sequencing** describes the process of ordering steps in a linear manner.\r\n\r\n**Algorithms** are lists of steps to complete a task. Programs are algorithms written as code for a computer to execute.\r\n",
