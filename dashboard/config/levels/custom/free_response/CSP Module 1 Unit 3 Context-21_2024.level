We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect.

Facilitators will use these reflections to inform their planning for the upcoming synchronous call, but the primary purpose of these reflections is to allow you time to process or apply what you learn in the asynchronous work.
