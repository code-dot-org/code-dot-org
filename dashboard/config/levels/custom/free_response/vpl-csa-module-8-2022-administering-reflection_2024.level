It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect.

Especially since the pre-assessment is short, they may see the final score and be discouraged that they didn’t score better.  \r\n\r\nAs a reminder, to you and your students, the pre-assessment is a tool to identify students’ strengths and areas of opportunity.  This is the first step in creating a plan to prepare for the AP Exam.  \r\n\r\nIn fact, the AP CSA Exam has cut-off scores that are distributed differently than how students may be used to distributions.  Perhaps in your school a 95% or 92% is an “A”.  The College Board has a different scale it uses.  The scale may change each year, but the table below shows a very rough guideline for AP cut scores based on historical AP data.\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/5debdeb1bf178457ccc433bf683f891a-image-1672795424307.23.26 PM.png\" width=\"40%\" alt=\"Example breakdown of scores\">\r\n\r\n## Reflect\r\n\r\n* Think back to how you want students to feel during AP Test prep. What can you do before or after the pre-assessment to help students feel the way you want them to feel?\t\r\n",
