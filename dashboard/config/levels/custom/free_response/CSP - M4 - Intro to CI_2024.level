It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect. How would you describe the difference between computer science and coding? How would you explain sequencing and algorithms to your students? ",

    "long_instructions": "# Getting Started with Academic Status\r\n\r\n**Goal:** In this section, our goal is to brainstorm ways students may demonstrate a variety of Computer Science skills in the classroom.  Eventually, as teachers we want to be able to use these insights to act in ways that help all students develop their own identities as computer science students. _(Estimated time: ~15 minutes)_\r\n\r\n## Understanding Status in the Classroom\r\n##### To better understand our students' experiences in the CS classroom, we are going to consider the implications of academic status. We are going to separate **social status** from **academic status**.  We will focus on **academic status**, or the perception of a student’s academic capability. \r\n\r\n##### While our perspective and a student’s perspective about their academic status may vary, providing positive reinforcement for our students helps to make our classrooms feel accessible and inclusive. As a teacher, we can influence a student’s academic status by broadening, labeling, and publicly recognizing what it means to be “smart” in a computer science classroom.\r\n\r\n###### **Note**: You will notice we put “smart” in quotes throughout this module.  We use this word a lot in society, but in education we know there are multiple intelligences and not just one way to be “smart”. We acknowledge that status can change over time - throughout the year or throughout the class period.\r\n___\r\n\r\n## Reflection Prompt:\r\n##### What are some ways students see others as “smart” when it comes to computer science?\r\n",
