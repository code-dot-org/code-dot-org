    "teacher_markdown": " Discussion Goal: Students should note how a model card requires a testing and evaluation component, as well as a limitations and warnings component. If the chatbot had been tested in these manners, potential flaws could have been discovered and avoided. Students may also note how a Foresight in AI chart helps imagine unexpected consequences from unintended users or those affected, which could have helped predict this kind of harmful impact.",
