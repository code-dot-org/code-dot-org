It tracks how many bee colonies were lost each year from 2015 to 2020 in states in different regions of the United States, including California, Florida, Illinois, Texas, and Maine._\r\n\r\n_**How Spread Out is the Data?**_\r\n\r\n_The data has a big range! It goes from as low as 9% of colonies lost in one year in Maine to as high as 64% in Illinois and Florida in other years. This tells us that bee colony losses can vary a lot depending on the state and the year._\r\n\r\n_**What is a Typical Response?**_\r\n\r\n_On average, about 38% of bee colonies were lost each year when you look at all the states together. This average helps us understand that losing around one-third of bee colonies yearly isn't uncommon, but the number can really differ from one state to another._\r\n\r\n_**Answering the Data Question**_\r\n\r\n_I think the big differences in how many bee colonies are lost in different states and years mean that a lot of factors like farming methods, pesticide use, local weather, and bee diseases might be affecting the bees. Each state has different conditions, which can change how many bees are lost._\r\n\r\n_**Adding Evidence**_\r\n\r\n_Looking at the data, states with big ups and downs in bee losses, like Illinois and Florida, are also places with a lot of farms. For instance, in Illinois in 2017, the bee loss shot up to 57% and then went down again. This could be because of changes in how farms in the area were operating or because of the weather that year. This kind of pattern suggests that what happens on farms, like the kind of chemicals used, can really impact bee health._\r\n\r\n_**Reflection**_\r\n\r\n_If I had more time, I’d like to look more into the specific chemicals and pesticides used on farms in these states and see exactly how they affect the bees. I'm somewhat confident in my findings because the data matches up with what we know hurts bees, like bad weather and harmful farming practices. But, without more details on other possible causes, like natural predators or diseases that weren’t recorded, some of my guesses might not be totally right. Another thing I'm curious about is how things like cities expanding into bee habitats might be affecting the bees. There’s still a lot to learn about what’s causing all these bees to die._"
