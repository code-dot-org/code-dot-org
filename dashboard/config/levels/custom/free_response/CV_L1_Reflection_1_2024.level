This definition is sure to evolve and grow as the module progresses. Some possible examples for a working definition might include:\r\n* Computer vision is like when your computer tries to figure out what's in a picture, kind of like how we recognize our friends' faces or stuff in photos\r\n* Computer vision helps computers 'see' and understand the images and videos like we do, but through cameras and algorithms\r\n* It's like teaching a computer to see and interpret the world around it, so it can recognize objects, people, and even actions\r\n* It's a part of artificial intelligence where computers are trained to interpret and understand the visual world\r\n"
