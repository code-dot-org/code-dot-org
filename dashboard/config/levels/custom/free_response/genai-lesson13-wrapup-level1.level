    "teacher_markdown": " Discussion Goal: This is the first of several wrap-ups that make connections between real-world news stories and the types of activities students participate in class. There is no right or wrong answer here, and a difference of opinion amongst peers can be helpful. The main thing to look for is that students can ground their responses in the activity they completed today, referencing temperature and hallucinations as part of their rationale. For example, after today, a student might think “maybe this could be okay, as long as the temperature of the AI is set very low”.",
