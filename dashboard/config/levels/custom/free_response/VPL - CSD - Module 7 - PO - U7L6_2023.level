It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect.

Students will be tasked with helping a computer learn to classify food as fruits or vegetables, graph 20 different fruits on two axes comparing “sweetness” to “easy to eat”, and then try to separate the data into groups - a fruit area, and a veggie area.\r\n\r\n## Lesson Objectives\r\n* ##### Explain how computers can separate data to make a decision\r\n\r\n## Investigation Tasks\r\n\r\n* ##### Review the lesson plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
