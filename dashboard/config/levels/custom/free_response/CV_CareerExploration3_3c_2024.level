    "long_instructions": "##The Details\r\n\r\nComputer vision is deeply entrenched in the history of planning for surgery: CT scans and other forms of diagnostic imaging make possible the construction of anatomical models. This imaging data is used to generate 2D projections called templates, 3D digital reconstructions, or even 3D printed models. The models then allow surgeons to explore various approaches and entry pathways prior to surgery, minimizing time of surgery and invasiveness.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, the application of emerging technologies like deep learning and virtual reality in preoperative planning has begun to streamline surgery even further. According to a recent study involving 193 knee surgery cases, AI-based preoperative planning has the potential to reduce the average number of intraoperative corrections a surgeon needs to make by up to 50%.\r\n\r\nIn image-guided surgery, a surgeon uses this real time visual and spatial information to navigate with enhanced precision. This technology is at the heart of minimally invasive surgical (MIS) procedures. Images taken during surgery can also be fused with preoperative images in augmented reality environments.\r\n\r\nWhile still far from common, we are also beginning to see computer vision-enabled navigation, AI-driven decision making, and robotic maneuverability come together in partially and even fully autonomous robotic surgical systems.\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/64cd54d9cd1012a358d519b130bc7372-image-1719522677947.png)\r\n##Explore further\r\nTimer permitting, click this link to explore this and other computer vision solutions more in-depth: [Computer Vision in Healthcare](https://medium.com/voxel51/how-computer-vision-is-changing-healthcare-in-2023-e49d63d9922f).\r\n\r\n*What is your opinion-- is this an effective and trusted use of computer vision within the healthcare industry?*\r\n\r\n",
