If you attach the clips to other items that conduct electricity, they can also work as buttons. For example, you can try paperclips or aluminum foil and the buttons will still work.\r\n\r\n## Do This\r\n- Find materials around the classroom that you think will conduct electricity. Find at least 5 different types of items\r\n- Grab two wires and connect them to your Circuit Playground according to the code below so the button will work\r\n- Connect your items to the alligator clips and test your device. See which items are conductive and work as buttons, and which ones do not\r\n\r\n**Record your results in the box below!** Which items worked as buttons? Which ones didn't?\r\n\r\n",
