    "long_instructions": "##The Details\r\nIn healthcare, computer aided detection (CADe) and computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) refer to any applications in which a computer assists a doctor or in understanding and evaluating medical data. Within the context of computer vision, this typically means images coming from MRI, CT, X-ray, or another form of diagnostic imaging technique. However, CAD can even be (and has been) applied to camera images of faces.\r\n\r\nComputers can assist doctors in detection by identifying suspicious regions in images and alerting the physician to these concerning areas. In some cases, CADe amounts to predicting high confidence regions of interest and projecting bounding boxes for these regions onto the original image. In other cases, region of interest identification is followed by instance segmentation. In still other cases, anomaly detection may be applied to catch abnormalities.\r\n\r\nComputer-aided diagnosis takes images and other patient record information as input, and outputs evaluates the likelihood that the patient has a given disease or condition. In cancer diagnosis, for instance, this often means predicting whether a tumor is benign or malignant.\r\n\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/69283df78ff42617c6fa1dd3165f58f1-image-1719521635931.png)\r\n\r\n##Explore further\r\nTimer permitting, click this link to explore this and other computer vision solutions more in-depth: [Computer Vision in Healthcare](https://medium.com/voxel51/how-computer-vision-is-changing-healthcare-in-2023-e49d63d9922f).\r\n\r\n*What is your opinion-- is this an effective and trusted use of computer vision within the health industry?*\r\n",
