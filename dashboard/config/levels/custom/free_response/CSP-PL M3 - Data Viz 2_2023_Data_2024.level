It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect. How would you describe the difference between computer science and coding? How would you explain sequencing and algorithms to your students? ",

In this lesson students create two different kinds of charts: a bar chart and a histogram. \r\n\r\n##### You may read the full lesson plan if you like, but we have highlighted the key beats of the lesson below:\r\n\r\n> #### **U5L2 - Exploring One Column**\r\n> ##### 1. In the opener, students review the reasons charts are useful for looking at data. \r\n> ##### 2. As a class, students practice reading a bar chart and review the kinds of questions a bar chart is and is not useful for answering. \r\n> ##### 3. Students watch a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/OjUEFHo3Yw0\" target=\"blank\">video</a> showing them how to use the Data Visualizer in App Lab.\r\n> ##### 4. Using an <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PxBRHtxwaV4IbHBJFW7IuIN-Ib0T0LybcjcwywJrLMg/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"blank\">Activity Guide</a> to support and document their work, students build different bar charts in the Data Visualizer and discuss why some are or are not useful. \r\n> ##### 5. As a class, students learn how to make histograms for building charts in instances where bar charts may not be useful. \r\n> ##### 6. Using an Activity Guide to support and document their work, students build different histograms using the Data Visualizer. (Note: this is the part of the activity you will do today). \r\n> ##### 7. The lesson concludes with a brief review of what they learned and how it connects to the Data Visualization Process. \r\n\r\n## Do this:\r\n* ##### Using your own copy of the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PxBRHtxwaV4IbHBJFW7IuIN-Ib0T0LybcjcwywJrLMg/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"blank\">Activity Guide</a> and the Data Visualizer found in <a href=\"https://studio.code.org/s/csp5-2024/lessons/2/levels/1\" target=\"blank\">U5L2, Level 1</a>, create your own histogram.  Follow the directions on page two of the Activity Guide to create your histogram. \r\n\r\n## Reflect: \r\n##### What aspects of the Data Visualization process did you use in this activity? ",
