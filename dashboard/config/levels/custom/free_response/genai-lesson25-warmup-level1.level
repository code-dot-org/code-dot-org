Students might also consider how new items on restaurant menus are tested (for example, Taco Bell has its own Test Kitchen) or how new pharmaceutical products are tested and approved before being allowed in public use (which is also how we find out the side effects). Make sure the discussion generates a variety of responses, and consider using this as an opportunity to highlight voices that may not regularly speak up.",
