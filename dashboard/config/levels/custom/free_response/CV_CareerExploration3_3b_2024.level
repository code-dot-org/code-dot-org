    "long_instructions": "##The Details\r\nComputer vision can be used to precisely monitor the progression of a disease over time. Just as a doctor measures patient weight, height, and blood pressure during an exam, and compares these to the patient’s past measurements to assess patient health, computer vision models allow doctors to track various diseases by comparing markers in biomedical images taken at different points in time.\r\n\r\nIn some applications, progression can be monitored by precisely tracking the size of objects like cavities or lesions. More generally, computer vision applications in disease progression monitoring are characterized by a deep learning model assigning a numerical score to an image or video. These scores allow physicians to quantify the severity and time of onset for a specific patient.\r\n\r\nBy precisely monitoring progression, computer vision models can help physicians to detect the onset of a disease more rapidly. For glaucoma, a 2018 study concluded that deep learning accelerated time to detection by more than a year.\r\n\r\nWhile computer vision applications in disease monitoring primarily involve applying machine learning models to images, there are also applications involving video data. In a 2022 paper, researchers found that by evaluating the movement patterns of Parkinson’s disease patients in the act of rising from a chair, the researchers could robustly estimate disease severity. To interpret patient movement, the researchers estimated patient pose in each frame, and then quantified the velocity and smoothness of motion across video frames.\r\n\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/b05fc0fa2e91308574685f8f3d39bb7f-image-1719522066641.png)\r\n##Explore further\r\nTimer permitting, click this link to explore this and other computer vision solutions more in-depth: [Computer Vision in Healthcare](https://medium.com/voxel51/how-computer-vision-is-changing-healthcare-in-2023-e49d63d9922f).\r\n\r\n*What is your opinion-- is this an effective and trusted use of computer vision within the healthcare industry?*\r\n\r\n",
