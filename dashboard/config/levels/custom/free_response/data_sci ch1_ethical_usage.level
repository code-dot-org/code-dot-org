This helped me to keep the analysis simple and direct. I made sure to only use data that was already available to the public, so I didn’t need to get any private information from beekeepers or from specific farms._\r\n\r\n_**Keeping Privacy in Mind:**_\r\n\r\n_The good thing about this dataset is that it doesn’t tell you about specific people or exactly where the bee colonies are, other than which state they’re in. By adding up all the monthly data into one number for each year, I made sure the information stayed even more general. This way, nobody’s private details can be figured out from my project, which is really important to keep things fair and private._\r\n\r\n_**Watching Out for Biases:**_\r\n\r\n* _Why I Chose Only Five States: I picked these states because they are in different regions of the country and have different weather and types of farms, which I thought could affect the bees a lot. This choice means my project doesn’t represent the whole country, but it lets me dive deep into these areas._\r\n* _How I Handled the Data: By turning monthly data into yearly data, I might have missed some important details that only happen in certain months, such as peak loss periods. This was a trade-off to make the trends clearer and the project more manageable._\r\n* _What’s Missing: My project stops at the year 2020. Since things like weather and farming can change a lot over time, what happens to bee colonies might change too. It would be great to keep this study going with new data every year to see if things get better or worse for the bees._"
