It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect.

This means actively attending to gender, race,  ethnicity, ability or socioeconomic status.”*\r\n\r\n## Goals\r\n\r\n* Identify teacher support available within lessons and the curriculum that support differentiation to promote inclusion\r\n* Identify current classroom strategies you use that meet various needs of learners and promote inclusion\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n\r\n* Review the lesson plan for the model lesson, <a href=\"https://studio.code.org/s/csd5-2022/lessons/5\" target=\"_blank\">Lesson 5:  Representing Numbers</a>\r\n* Preview the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/15Y6Mo3fMUtHq16SSskABgcYE-5xfk-Ewv0z_o4uaLdI/preview\" target=\"_blank\">CSD Guide to Differentiation 2022</a>\r\n\r\n## Reflection\r\n\r\n**Prompts:**\r\n* What teacher supports and strategies are available within Lesson 5 (e.g. Teacher Tips, etc) and the CSD Guide to Differentiation 2022?\r\n* What strategies do you currently use in your classroom that promote inclusion and meet the unique learning needs of your students? \r\n\r\n\r\n",
