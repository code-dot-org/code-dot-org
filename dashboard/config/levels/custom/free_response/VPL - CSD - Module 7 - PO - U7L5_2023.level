It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect.

Students are guided to the conclusion that surveying their users can help them make the best decision by looking for patterns in the data and basing their decisions on these patterns.\r\n\r\n## Lesson Objectives\r\n* ##### Describe how a model makes a decision (for example: with randomness, or a decision tree, or using data)\r\n* ##### Look for patterns in data to help make a decision\r\n\r\n\r\n## Investigation Tasks\r\n\r\n* ##### Review the lesson plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
