    "teacher_markdown": "This question aims to evaluate studentsâ€™ ability to consider the broader implications of how data is visualized, including the potential social or personal impacts of misleading information and the responsibility of data scientists and analysts in presenting data ethically, without bias, and in ways that do not mislead or deceive stakeholders. Students should be able to articulate the consequences of ethical and unethical data presentations, reflecting on how these practices affect real-world decisions and perceptions. A good response could look like: \"Misleading visualizations can have serious consequences, such as influencing public policy based on flawed data interpretations. For example, if health data is presented in a way that downplays the severity of an issue, it could lead to inadequate funding or delayed policy responses, potentially affecting the health outcomes of populations. Ethical visualization practices are crucial to ensure that decisions are made based on accurate and fully represented data.\"",
