The best data type is based on how it is used in the program and the possible values the variable will store.\r\n\r\n**Sample Responses:**\r\n\r\n1. Population of a country: The population of a country should be represented as an integer. Each person in the population is represented as a whole number because you can not have a fraction of a person.\r\n\r\n2. Shoe size: Shoe size should be represented as a double because there are shoe-size systems that include half size. Therefore, a decimal is needed to represent the half sizes.\r\n\r\n3. Phone number: A phone number should be represented as a String. While a phone number may appear to be an integer, phone numbers are a string of numbers that are not used for calculations.",
