We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect.

Then, students research other examples of how AI is impacting society, focusing on users who are impacted by the examples they find. Finally, students share their findings with each other.\r\n\r\n## Lesson Objectives\r\n* ##### Describe how Artificial Intelligence is having an impact on society.\r\n\r\n## Investigation Tasks\r\n\r\n* ##### Review the lesson plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
