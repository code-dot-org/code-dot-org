It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect.

This is a great opportunity to intentionally make space for your students’ ideas.  For example, a student who is really into art might think of representing tubes of paint using code.  They might think of attributes that you would never consider and have their own ideas about what is important to check for when thinking of checking for equality between two tubes of paint. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Reflect\r\nThink about your students and how they would respond to this content.  Consider:\r\n\r\n* What classes would your students create to represent real world objects?  \r\n* What attributes would be important for those objects? \r\n* How would your students think about equality for those objects? What attributes would be important to take into account when checking for equality?  Which would be unimportant to your students?",
