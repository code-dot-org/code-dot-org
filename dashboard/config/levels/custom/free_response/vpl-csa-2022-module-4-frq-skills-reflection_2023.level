Now that you have seen a real FRQ question from the College Board, let’s look at Code.org’s FRQ day question from Unit 5 to compare the structure and content to FRQs from the College Board. \r\n\r\n## Do this:\r\n\r\n* Navigate to the **Links** section of the <a href=\"https://studio.code.org/s/csa5-2022/lessons/14\" target=\"blank\">lesson plan for Unit 5, Lesson 14.</a>\r\n* Review the FRQ from the FRQ day. In Unit 5.  We recommend trying the FRQ yourself during this time. \r\n* Score your answer using the scoring guidelines provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Reflect\r\nWhat similarities and differences do you notice between the Code.org FRQ day question and the question from the College Board you reviewed?",
