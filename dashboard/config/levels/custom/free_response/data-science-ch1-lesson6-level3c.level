In this activity, students will need to choose data from the charts that they find to be persuasive and to articulate a decision that can be based on that data. Although interpretations of the data might vary, here is a sample response for this dataset:\r\nIn the Popularity of Past Event Spaces dataset, it is clear that the gym is the most popular space for students to gather with a density reading of 4.6 students per meter squared. In particular, the dance floor portion of the gym attracts most students. This shows the importance of choosing music that broadly appeals to all students since dancing seems to be the most popular activity during school events.\r\n",
