Try to have at least 2 students share what they wrote.\r\n\r\n Discussion Goal: This discussion foreshadows the activity that students will do today, where they help brainstorm issues to address in a community. As students share, focus on the observation that students are making that influences their desire to improve their community. Some examples might be:\r\n\r\n- Observing trash on the street or dead greenery next to a highway\r\n- Observing that some buildings or streets are difficult to navigate for people with wheelchairs or mothers with strollers\r\n- Observing stray animals or other wildlife that struggle in busy areas",
