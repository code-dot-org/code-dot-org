Your job is to guess words it will accept and words it will reject\r\n#####- For example: the word “Teeth” is accepted by the Green Glass Door\r\n#####- And the word “Mouth” is rejected by the Green Glass Door\r\n\r\n####Suggest some words and see what happens! Look for patterns in the words that are accepted or rejected!####",
    "teacher_markdown": "For the Teacher: In this game, you know the secret rules (explained below) and are reacting to the suggestions that the class makes. As the class suggests words, you tell them whether or not words are accepted or rejected. This game requires students to notice patterns in the words that are accepted or rejected, and use those patterns to inform the guesses they make. The goal of the activity is for students to eventually discern the rules of the game from these patterns.\r\n\r\nThe Rules: The secret of the game is: words with double letters are accepted and all others are rejected. This is why Teeth is accepted (because of the double e’s) while Mouth is not (because no letter is repeated). This is also where the name of the game comes from - Green Glass Door all have double letters.\r\n\r\nPlaying the Game: Ask students to suggest words and write them down somewhere visible, then tell the class whether the Green Glass Door accepts or rejects each word. Instead of doing this one-at-a-time, it can be helpful to take words in batches - like 3 to 5 at a time - and then mark each one as accept or reject in a batch. It’s important to leave all guesses in a visible spot so students can look at the data to inform their next guesses. Over time, students may start to notice the pattern - that words with double-letters are accepted - and start guessing those more frequently. If students are struggling to catch on, it can be helpful to rewrite the list so several accepted words are together and several rejected words are together. You can also provide your own examples, or reference the name of game - Green Glass Door - as a hint.\r\n\r\nManaging Expectations: This activity has a specific type of engagement that some students may struggle with: the activity deliberately starts with 0 knowledge, so most answers are likely to be incorrect rather than correct. Some students may struggle with randomly guessing and getting it incorrect more often in the beginning. However, this is exactly the mindset that is necessary to carry forward into the rest of the lesson and is an important part of how machine learning really works: machines make an enormous amount of incorrect guesses that are gradually refined over time before eventually getting more and more accurate.\r\n\r\nEnding the Game: As the game continues, some students will discovered the rule while others may not. Encourage the students who think they know to keep it a secret until others have caught on. Using your judgement, when enough students feel like they know the rule, continue to the next slide to reveal the rule of the game",
