    "teacher_markdown": "Discussion Goal: This prompt follows a similar pattern as many levels in this lesson (where students are helping a fictional person solve a problem or accomplish a task) so make sure students stay focused on the user-story and their needs. A key goal in this discussion is to draw out all of the intersecting factors that could cause a prompt like this to snowball. Students may think this is a simple prompt around writing social media - if so, push them to consider:\r\n- Social media follows a specific format, including hashtags and tagging, which may be hard to describe in a prompt\r\n- A key part of marketing is considering the audience - who are the people Hannah needs to reach?\r\n- Hannah needs a tone that represents her voice, but also allows her to advertise (and get paid) by her sponsor, which is a difficult needle to thread.\r\n\r\nEmphasizing all of these intersecting points is a great tie-in to today’s lesson.",
