However, getting a chatbot to talk about this artwork is difficult - there isn't a lot of information about the artform, and most of it doesn't match his experiences. But, Ethan has an opportunity to interview a master loom artist in his community to learn more about the practice to help with his chatbot.\r\n\r\nWhat are two pieces of advice you would you give Ethan for how he could use this interview and Retrieval to improve his chatbot? Give specific examples of the kind of information that would be helpful and why.",
