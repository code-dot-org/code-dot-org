But there's a bug and the program doesn't work as it's intended.\r\n\r\nRead through the following program, seeing if you can find where the bug might be.  After discussing the following questions with your partner, write down your predictions and run the code to see what the program does.\r\n\r\n* What will happen when you run this program and click on one of the buttons?\r\n* What advice would you give to the person who wrote this program so that they can avoid this type of bug in the future?\r\n\r\n",
