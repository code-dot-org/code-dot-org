We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect.

Students learn through doing and exploration rather than through direct instruction or memorizing facts. Let's begin by considering how we, as educators, create and support a classroom environment that allows students to grow and develop in an active role. \r\n\r\n## Reflection\r\n\r\n* #### What does it mean for students to be active in your classroom?  \r\n* #### What sorts of things are students doing in your classroom? \r\n* #### What are you doing to support active learning?\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n##### **Note**: You can change the size of the text box by clicking and dragging the bottom-right corner of the text box.\r\n",
