Students should also say there needed to be a base model to start with, and the data was used to adjust the model to act more like a law chatbot than a typical chatbot.\r\n\r\nOnce students have answered, you can visit the model to check: https://huggingface.co/AdaptLLM/law-LLM. This is one of three models fine-tuned to answer content-specific questions.",
