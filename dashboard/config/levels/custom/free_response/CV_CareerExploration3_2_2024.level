    "long_instructions": "##How Can Computer Vision Further Assist Healthcare Workers?\r\n\r\nNow that you have explored some of the professions in healthcares and the ways in which computer vision is expanding within the industry, use your knowledge to help problem-solve.\r\n\r\nThe following were identified as some of the main issues associated with the modern healthcare system:\r\n\r\n* **Rising costs of healthcare**: in real terms, in the United States healthcare costs have risen by 290% since 1980. Costs are so high that in a recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll, 43% of respondents said that a family member had put off or postponed necessary health care as a result.\r\n* **Shortage of healthcare workers**: despite the millions of workers employed in the healthcare industry, 132 countries are experiencing shortages of physicians, with an estimated 12.8 million more doctors needed worldwide to alleviate this problem. The United States is expected to face a shortage of up to 124,000 physicians and supportive roles by 2034.\r\n* **Time-intensive EHR**: according to a study involving 155,000 US physicians, on average, physicians spend more than 16 minutes per patient ecounter using electronic health records (EHR). This time was split between chart review, documentation, and ordering.\r\n\r\nWith a partner, focus on one of the healthcare professions that were provided and brainstorm a possible way in which one or more of the computer vision techniques listed below might assist help to address one of the major issues in healthcare currently.\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/fed54377ea4e77292ad20882d4831dde-image-1719520912071.png)\r\n\r\nInclude the following:\r\n* The name of the healthcare-related job that you examined?\r\n* What is the major issue that you will be addressing?\r\n* How might one of the computer vision techniques seen here assist to alleviate this major issue in some way (*small or large*)?\r\n\r\n",
