It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect. How would you describe the difference between computer science and coding? How would you explain sequencing and algorithms to your students? ",

    "long_instructions": "# Introduction to the Create Performance Task\r\n\r\n**Goal:** The purpose of this section is to help you understand the structure and requirements of the Create Performance Task. *(Estimated time: ~15 minutes)*\r\n\r\n## The Create Performance Task\r\n\r\n##### The Create Performance Task isn't covered until Unit 9. Modules 7 and 8 will go more in-depth with the Unit 9 content, but this serves as a **quick** introduction to the Create Performance Task for you as the teacher.\r\n\r\n> ##### ⚠️ **NOTE:**\r\n> ###### In the 2023-24 school year, the College Board has made updates to the Create Performance Task in response to the implications of the widespread availability of ChatGPT and other similar generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools.\r\n> ###### As a result, the College Board has created an <a href=\"https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles/course/frequently-asked-questions/about-create-performance-task-updates\" target=\"blank\">FAQ page</a> about these updates. Rest assured that the Code.org curriculum and Modules 7 and 8 will reflect these updates and prepare you and your students to complete the Creat Performance Task.\r\n\r\n\r\n## High-Level Description of the Create Performance Task\r\n\r\n##### For the Create Performance Task (worth 30% of students' score), students create a program of their choice. The College Board requires that students are given **nine in-class hours** to work on the Create Performance Task. \r\n\r\n##### Students submit their Create Performance Task to the College Board Digital Portfolio including:\r\n\r\n* ##### A video of running program\r\n* ##### A PDF of program code\r\n* ##### A Personalized Project Reference (more on this at the link below)\r\n\r\n##### All three components of the Create Performance Task are typically due by the end of April. Check the College Board website for the specific date and time.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n##### **On the day of the Multiple Choice Exam, May 15th**, students will complete written responses about their program. Students will have access to their student-authored Personalized Project Reference and write responses to prompts related to the code contained in this reference. \r\n\r\n## Do This:\r\n* ##### Read pages 1-5 of the <a href=\"https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf\" target=\"blank\">Student Handouts</a>.  \r\n* ##### Consider what aspects of the Create Performance Task your students have already started to prepare for by completing the CSP curriculum.\r\n\r\n## Reflect: \r\n##### What do you think your students are prepared for? What will they need additional support with?\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12px;\">**Note:** Your cohort's facilitators will be able to see your response, but your response will not be seen by other participants in your cohort. Facilitators will use these reflections to inform their planning for the upcoming synchronous workshop, but the primary purpose of these reflections is to allow you time to process or apply what you learn in the asynchronous work. For that reason, feel free to write as much or as little as is helpful for you - this might be two paragraphs, two sentences, a list, etc. You don't need to worry about spelling or punctuation in this space either - this is your space! </span>\r\n",
