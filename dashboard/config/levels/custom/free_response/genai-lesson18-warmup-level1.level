In this discussion, focus on real-world examples and the impact this misinformation could have on problems they are trying to solve. For example, having outdated weather information meant that you needed to cancel a party or buy additional supplies to handle the weather on a particular day. Focusing on the connection to students’ lived experiences and the impact will tie into the focus on user-stories and real-world scenarios in today’s lesson.",
