Perhaps nowhere is computer visionâ€™s liberating effect on people more pronounced than in assisting people with vision loss. Computer vision makes it easier for them to live on their own and attend work and school.\r\n\r\nComputer Vision technology can assistby providing audio descriptions of their surroundings, identifying objects, and helping them navigate their environment. In the same way, Augmented Reality technology provides people with physical disabilities with real-time assistance and information about their environment, making it easier for them to perform tasks and navigate unfamiliar places.\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/6f61b787675296b259df9eddeae96907-image-1719523430991.png)\r\n\r\n##Explore further\r\nTimer permitting, click this link to explore this and other computer vision solutions more in-depth: [Computer Vision in Healthcare](https://medium.com/voxel51/how-computer-vision-is-changing-healthcare-in-2023-e49d63d9922f).\r\n\r\n*What is your opinion-- is this an effective and trusted use of computer vision within the healthcare industry?*\r\n\r\n",
