Some mammals that sleep a lot, like those sleeping around 20 hours, don’t live as long as some that sleep less, around 10 hours.\r\n\r\nWhich mammals have the longest lifespans, and what are their sleep and habitat patterns?\r\n- The mammals with the longest lifespans in the graph are those that live in both habitats and they sleep less, around 10 to less than 20 hours. It seems like having a versatile habitat might help some mammals live longer.\r\n\r\nIs there a pattern in lifespan based on the combination of sleep hours and habitat?\r\n- It's kind of mixed. Mammals that live both on land and water tend to have longer lifespans across different sleep hours. However, those that live only in water or only on land usually have shorter lifespans, regardless of how much they sleep.\r\n",
