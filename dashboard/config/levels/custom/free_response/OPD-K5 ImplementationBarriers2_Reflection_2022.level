Take this time to think about the influence you may have in addressing these additional barriers.  Here are some ideas for you to consider during this reflection.\r\n\r\n### What can I influence in order to address barriers?\r\n\r\n* Requesting tech support or additional devices.\r\n* Collaborating with teachers, administrators, or support staff.\r\n* Setting aside time to prepare to teach Computer Science Fundamentals.\r\n* Adjusting classroom routines and procedures to make space for teaching Computer Science Fundamentals.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Prompts\r\n\r\n* What additional barriers to teaching and implementing Computer Science Fundamentals courses might you encounter?\r\n* Describe **two** next steps you want to take to address these additional barriers.\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n",
