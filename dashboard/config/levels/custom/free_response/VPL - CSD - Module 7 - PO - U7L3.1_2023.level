It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect.

They participate in a color pattern activity to simulate building a machine learning model without help, then they play a game called \"Green Glass Door\" as an example of supervised learning, and finally, they will sort several scenarios into “supervised” or “unsupervised” learning.\r\n\r\n## Lesson Objectives\r\n* ##### Describe the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning.\r\n\r\n## Investigation Tasks\r\n\r\n* ##### Review the lesson plan.\r\n\r\n### Next Up\r\n##### Click continue review key vocabulary introduced in this lesson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
