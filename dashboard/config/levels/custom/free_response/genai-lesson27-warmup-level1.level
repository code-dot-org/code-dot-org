For example, students might think of tutoring chatbots or writing assistance chatbots that could be helpful to them personally. They might also think of chatbots that help brainstorm recipes or ideas as something a family member might find useful. As students name examples of chatbot, try to focus on the kind of problem this chatbot is solving and how it’s personally relevant to students or to members of their community.",
