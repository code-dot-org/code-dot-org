It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect.

What do you see in this example that you would like to see your students do in the project as well?  Consider how the code is structured, what makes the code readable, where you see creativity in the project, etc. \r\n3. Share your thoughts to these prompts in the space below. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n**Up next:** We will look at the rubric for the project and determine what, if anything you would want to add to the rubric for your students.",
