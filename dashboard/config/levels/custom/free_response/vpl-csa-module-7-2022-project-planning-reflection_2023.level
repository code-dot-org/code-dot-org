This Project Planning board is similar to a “Scrum Board” that is used in software engineering.\r\n\r\n\r\nComputer Science Educator Jen Manly describes how she uses the Scrum board in her classroom in a  <a href=\"https://csteachers.org/entity/details?ViewId=1fb80017-bc30-48e8-ad6b-7a11c251f6b5&EntityId=8102d14d-a2a2-4fa3-a2b2-471f1f4d9637&EntityTypeId=65b83fde-7436-497a-a0f0-f4112cd76e61\" target=\"blank\">CSTA Blog post</a>.  She says,\r\n\r\n>The Scrum framework makes project management a breeze. With the use of a Scrum board, students create a visual artifact to manage their tasks. This serves many purposes; it helps the team to manage their work, of course, but it also aids in classroom management and assessment. If a student is off task, a quick glance at their board gives insight into what they’re supposed to be working on. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Reflect\r\n* How do you plan to use the Project Planning Board in your classroom?  Will you use a physical copy?  A digital version?\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n**Up Next:** Learn about project management vocabulary. ",
