It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect.

Problems should be purposeful. Students should understand “why” the problem is important before deciding “how” to solve the problem. Both the “why” and the “how” should be relevant to the student (facilitates motivation) and to the learning objectives (facilitates learning). \r\n\r\n\r\n## Reflection\r\n\r\n* What does it mean for learning to start with the “why” before moving on to the “how”? \r\n* How might students make connections between the \"why\" and \"how\", better support their own learning?\r\n",
