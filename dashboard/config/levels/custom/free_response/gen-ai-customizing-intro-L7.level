Mid temperatures are better for a combination of the two (like making an argument, that requires both logical and emotional appeals).\r\n\r\nStudents may also call out places where bias and hallucinations are important. Lower temperatures can be better for places where we want to try and eliminate hallucinations, although we will learn some better tricks for this later in the unit."
