My job is to make our city a must-visit destination for tourists from all over the world. My main task is to come up with effective ways to promote our city's attractions, culture, and events. I create marketing materials, manage social media content, and help organize events that can draw visitors.\r\n\r\n### Why I'm Here\r\nThinking about boosting tourism post-pandemic, I believe a chatbot could really help personalize the way we interact with potential tourists. By providing tailored travel suggestions, fun historical facts, and updates on current events, a chatbot can make planning their visit easier and more exciting. This tool could be a key part of our strategy to enhance tourists' experiences, making them feel uniquely cared for and informed. This way, they're more likely to enjoy longer stays and participate in more activities, which is exactly what we need to boost our local tourism industry.\r\n\r\n**Defining the Problem:** The local tourism industry needs revitalization post-pandemic, with a need to attract tourists through personalized and engaging information.\r\n\r\n> We've been asked to help develop a chatbot for this person. Before diving in, let's take a moment to **Prepare** and plan how we can develop this chatbot\r\n> \r\n> 1) How could we use a **System Prompt** when making the chatbot? What parts of this problem is a System Prompt most helpful for?\r\n> 2) How could we use **Retrieval** when making the chatbot? What parts of this problem is Retrieval most helpful for?",
