It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect.

In Unit 6 - Creating Apps with Devices, students use the process when **programming** their device. If you need a refresher on the Problem Solving Process, refer to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q10YfeMqY95SAq0VAB3wnLPK2aDuJEoD2j82n-i183Y/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Problem Solving Process with Programming</a>. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/09a4bce7db7bc095f011b8e3ab0f314b-image-1596498378646.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; height:30%; width:30%\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Respond to the following questions:\r\n\r\n##### * What challenges do you anticipate students will encounter during the “try” phase as they begin to use a device? \r\n##### * What support will you have in place in your classroom to help students during this time?\r\n___\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12px;\">If more space is needed, click and drag the bottom-right corner to adjust the size of the text box.</span>\r\n\r\n",
