It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect. How would you describe the difference between computer science and coding? How would you explain sequencing and algorithms to your students? ",

Perhaps you noticed a similar structure for each of the user stories provided in the Unit 3 project on the previous level.  They all follow the structure “As a [role or persona] I want to [action], so that I can [benefit].”\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nLet’s look at some examples for how to use this structure for user stories in a variety of contexts.  \r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/4ed935fc11025c7ad3ff18a4fccbffc3-image-1659554019550.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Writing your own user stories in the Unit 3 project\r\n\r\nIn the Unit 3 project, students can choose to write their own user story using this same structure as shown above.\r\nFor students who choose to write their own user story for the Unit 3 project, we recommend that they start with determining what data they will use first.  Students can spend a lot of time looking for data to meet their needs, so starting with data and then developing a user story for a user who would benefit from analyzing that data can help students jumpstart their project process. \r\n\r\n## Try it yourself!\r\n\r\nLet's try writing some of our own user stories. \r\n\r\n* Assume you were given  <a href=\"https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2018/2018-10-16/recent-grads.csv\" target=\"blank\">this dataset </a> on college majors.  Consider, who would find this data helpful?  What would they want to do with the data and why?  \r\n\r\n* Based on the data, write one or more user stories in the space below, using the format “As a [role or persona] I want to [action], so that I can [benefit].”\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n**Up next:**  We will brainstorm questions that user stories can generate to help software engineers and students develop their projects. \r\n",
