My role involves organizing activities and managing services that cater to the needs of elderly members of our community. I work to create a welcoming and supportive environment that helps reduce feelings of loneliness and isolation among our seniors.\r\n\r\n### Why I'm Here\r\nMany of our elderly members are not just physically isolated but also digitally disconnected, which can intensify feelings of exclusion. I see a great opportunity to use a chatbot to bridge this gap. By developing a chatbot that can start friendly chats, remind them of upcoming events, and offer easy-to-understand tech support, we can make our members feel more connected and integrated into the community. This chatbot could act like a virtual companion, helping them navigate both the social and technological aspects of their lives more confidently. This aligns perfectly with my goal to improve our elderly members' engagement and well-being.\r\n\r\n**Defining the Problem:** Elderly community members feel isolated and struggle with using modern technology, affecting their social engagement and access to community resources.\r\n\r\n> We've been asked to help develop a chatbot for this person. Before diving in, let's take a moment to **Prepare** and plan how we can develop this chatbot\r\n> \r\n> 1) How could we use a **System Prompt** when making the chatbot? What parts of this problem is a System Prompt most helpful for?\r\n> 1) How could we use **Retrieval** when making the chatbot? What parts of this problem is Retrieval most helpful for?",
