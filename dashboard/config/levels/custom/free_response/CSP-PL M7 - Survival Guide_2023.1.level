It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect. How would you describe the difference between computer science and coding? How would you explain sequencing and algorithms to your students? ",

It contains activities to help students prepare for working independently on the Create Performance Task.  The survival guide is intended to supplement the directions provided by the College Board and focus on areas that students may struggle with.\r\n\r\n## Do this:\r\n* Make your own copy of the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TgVzXFCMqLLu8U2wHCWfj6rC9yUSBAWLOsdaEV8xxF8/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"blank\">Create Performance Task Survival Guide</a>\r\n* Read pages 1-2 in the Create Performance Task Survival Guide.  Write down any questions you have.\r\n* Complete the “Function Requirements” activities found on pages 3-5 of the Create Performance Task Survival Guide.\r\n* Check your answers to the “Function Requirements” by using the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W2Rr1AaABirBXR2leyUsKct-CJSQu8PbutRzSYxKw34/edit\" target=\"blank\">Answer Key</a>.  Once again, write down any questions you have. \r\n* Skim the rest of the activities in the Create Performance Task Survival Guide to get an idea of the other tasks included in this lesson.\r\n\r\nThe Create Performance Task Survival guide is done before students start officially working on their task, at which point your ability to answer questions is more limited.  In the next section, we are going to look at what restrictions the College Board puts on how you support students during the Create Performance Task. \r\n\r\n## Reflect: \r\n\r\n* What section of the Create Performance Task Survival Guide was most helpful to you?  \r\n* Which section do you think students will find most helpful?  Why?",
