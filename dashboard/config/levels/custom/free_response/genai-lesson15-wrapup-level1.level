The goal is to connect the skills students are learning to a real-world interest they have, potentially seeing themselves or a community member as a “user-story” supplied in these levels. Encourage students to make connections with how these skills might help themselves in their personal or future professional lives, or how there may be gaps in what chatbots are being used for and they have an opportunity to change that.",
