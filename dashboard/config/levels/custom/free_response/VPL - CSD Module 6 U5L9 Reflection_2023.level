It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect.

Chapter 2 shifts the focus from representing data information to solving problems using data.  The Problem Solving Process supports students in drawing conclusions within Data and Society, Chapter 2. Respond to the following prompts to guide you as you plan to teach Lesson 9.\r\n\r\n**Prompts:** \r\n\r\n* Problems should be purposeful.  How might you modify the scenario in Lesson 9 to be more relevant to your students?\r\n\r\n* How might students use the Problem Solving Process for data to draw conclusions in Lesson 9?\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12px;\"> If more space is needed, click and drag the bottom-right corner to adjust the size of the text box.</span>\r\n",
