Using the second histogram I made I can see that they are both 5 years old, both have green eyes, and while their fur isn’t exactly the same color, they are similar with Peebles having grey fur and Wally having black and white fur. The other cats that are 5 years old are orange or brown with stripes and have yellow eyes.\r\n",
