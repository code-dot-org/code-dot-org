Ideally this question relates to experiences students have in their science classes - if not, consider extending the question towards a math context as well where we are asked to show our work step-by-step. The same rationale applies - it helps us see how we got to a certain point in the problem, and it helps others coming later understand what we did to get here. As the discussion winds down, emphasize how this notebook could be thought of documentation for the experiment, similar to the type of documentation provided by a model card from yesterdayâ€™s lesson.",
