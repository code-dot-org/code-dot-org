It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect.

Facilitators will use these reflections to inform their planning for the upcoming synchronous workshop, but the primary purpose of these reflections is to allow you time to process or apply what you learn in the asynchronous work. For that reason, feel free to write as much or as little as is helpful for you - this might be two paragraphs, two sentences, a list, etc. You don't need to worry about spelling or punctuation in this space either - this is your space! </span>\r\n\r\n",
