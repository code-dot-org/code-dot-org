It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect.

It also began with a general reflection of what active learning can look like in the classroom.  After reviewing the first four lessons of The Design Process, let's revisit what active learning can look like when starting The Design Process.\r\n\r\n### **Respond to the following questions:**\r\n\r\n* #### What can active learning look like when introducing The Design Process?\r\n* #### What are students doing?  What are you doing?\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n##### **Note**: You can change the size of the text box by clicking and dragging the bottom-right corner of the text box.",
