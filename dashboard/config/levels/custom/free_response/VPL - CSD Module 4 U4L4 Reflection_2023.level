It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect.

Decomposition? \r\n* How can you highlight opportunities for students to engage in the process of continuous improvement in order to modify and enhance creative projects? \r\n* How can you highlight opportunities for students to break large problems into smaller components in order to begin taking small steps towards the larger goal?\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12px;\"> If more space is needed, click and drag the bottom-right corner to adjust the size of the text box.</span>\r\n",
