Use the map tool to explore how these seals are behaving in different parts of the ocean and answer the data questions:\r\n- Do the seals swim the same paths?\r\n- Is there a pattern to where the seals are located during certain months?\r\n\r\n####[CODAP Link](https://codap.concord.org/app/static/dg/en/cert/index.html#shared=https%3A%2F%2Fcfm-shared.concord.org%2FQjFK059P5aXrftUaUlty%2Ffile.json)\r\n\r\n#####Do This\r\n\r\n#####1.

    "teacher_markdown": "Example student responses:\r\n\r\nDo the seals swim the same paths?\r\n- While the four seals generally swim the same area, they don’t take the exact same path. The map shows me that one of the seals goes far more north than the other three.\r\n\r\nIs there a pattern to where the seals are located during certain months?\r\n- I can tell from the map that the four seals generally swim around the same latitude during the same months. January they are close to the shore, moving further out to sea at the months progress until mid-summer when it looks like they have gone as far as they are going to go and then start heading back to the shore in September and October until they are finally back close to shore in December.\r\n",
