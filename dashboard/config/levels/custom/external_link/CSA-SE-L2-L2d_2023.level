Traverse through exciting landscapes, solve riddles, and engage in quests using just your text commands.*\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/21304bf12cc1cae9b42110e7df85e8c9-texttrekkers.gif)\r\n\r\nâœ… **Do This:** Clone the repository and use Copilot as the Driver to implement a method to process the user's input and return a response.\r\n\r\n### Using Copilot as the Driver\r\n\r\n**Step 1:** Enter this prompt in the chat to prime Copilot to act as the driver:\r\n\r\n<p style=\"background-color: #E5E4E2; color: black; font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.5em; padding: 20px;\">\r\nCan you act as a pair programmer for me while I work on this project? I'd like you to act as the driver while I act as the navigator. You will suggest code a few lines at a time and also explain what the code does. I will keep track of the bigger picture and check your code to make sure it's doing what we want it to do.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n**Step 2:** Write your code to complete the program. Every **1-2 minutes**, check in with Copilot like you would if your driver was one of your peers. For example, you could:\r\n\r\n* Have it decompose the problem into steps\r\n\r\n* Prompt Copilot for code for a specific step and enter it into your editor\r\n\r\n* Provide feedback to Copilot on code that it generated to improve the solution or suggest a different way to write the code\r\n\r\n* Suggest fixes to Copilot for any syntax or logic errors\r\n\r\n* Make sure that the code it suggests will solve the problem",
