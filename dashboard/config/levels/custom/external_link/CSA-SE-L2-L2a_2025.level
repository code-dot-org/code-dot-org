I'd like you to act as the driver while I act as the navigator. You will suggest code a few lines at a time and also explain what the code does. I will keep track of the bigger picture and check your code to make sure it's doing what we want it to do.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n**Step 2:** Write your code to complete the program. Every **1-2 minutes**, check in with Copilot like you would if your driver was one of your peers. For example, you could:\r\n\r\n* Have it decompose the problem into steps\r\n\r\n* Prompt Copilot for code for a specific step and enter it into your editor\r\n\r\n* Provide feedback to Copilot on code that it generated to improve the solution or suggest a different way to write the code\r\n\r\n* Suggest fixes to Copilot for any syntax or logic errors\r\n\r\n* Make sure that the code it suggests will solve the problem",
