I’m going to write some code and periodically, I'll ask you to help check that I'm on the right track. You can ask me questions and give suggestions, but don't give me solutions.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n**Step 2:** Write your code to complete the program. Every **1-2 minutes**, check in with Copilot like you would if your navigator was one of your peers. For example, you could:\r\n\r\n* Ask what step you should do next\r\n\r\n* Get feedback on your solution so far, such as to see if there is a better way to write the code you've written\r\n\r\n* Check if you have any syntax or logic errors or suggest fixes\r\n\r\n* Make sure that your code will solve the problem",
