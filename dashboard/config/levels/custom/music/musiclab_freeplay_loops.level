Here's some code that just plays a melody.\n## Do This:\n1. Press the Run button to take a listen!\n2. Add a new play block to finish the song!\n - Click the Sounds toolbox\n - Drag out the play block\n - Attach it to the bottom of the existing blocks\n - Click the name and select a new sound to play. \n - Try finding the right part to play at the end.\n\nAs you add blocks, you should notice that new bars appear in the timeline to show you where your new sounds will play.\n",

But songs can get pretty long, so we'd need a ton of blocks if we added them one by one! Thankfully, repeating things is also common in code. \r\n\r\nIn the Control category of the toolbox, you'll find the repeat block. Anything you put inside it will be repeated the number of times set by the block. \r\n\r\n## Do This:\r\nUse the repeat block to repeat the sounds that make up your beat a few times. You should notice the beat repeats the same number of times you set it in the loop.",
