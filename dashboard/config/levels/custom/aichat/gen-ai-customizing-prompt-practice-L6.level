Let's add an extra sentence to help guide the chatbot with how it should respond and see which values are the most appealing.\r\n\r\n### Do This\r\n\r\n1) Add a sentence to the end of the system prompt telling the chatbot to use specific tones. Choose 3 different tones to try.\r\n    - For example: Academic and Thoughtful, or Friendly and Jovial, or Sarcastic and Grumpy.\r\n2) For each of these tone: ask the chatbot questions about basketball and notice how the response changes.\r\n    - Which one would you recommend for a new basketball player?\r\n\r\nTest the chatbot! Have a conversation with at least 4 messages, then press the `Continue`(#7435b2) button!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n::: details [**Click here to see example messages to try in this level**]\r\n* What are fouls?\r\n* What is a double dribble?\r\n:::\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",
