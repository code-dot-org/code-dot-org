It has the same system prompt as the original chatbot.\r\n\r\nLet's evaluate this chatbot now - will it work for a student in a middle school biology and health class? Or is it better for advanced medical students becoming doctors?\r\n\r\n### Do This\r\n\r\n1) Test **the same prompts from before** in this chatbot. For example:\r\n    - \"Describe the gall bladder and what it does in your body\"\r\n    - \"Describe the Circle of Willis and what it does in your body\"\r\n    - \"Describe the  liver and what it does in your body\"\r\n    - \"Describe the Choroid Plexus and what it does in your body\"\r\n2) Read over the responses and rate how understandable they are:\r\n    - (1) A small child could understand these responses\r\n    - (2) A high school student could understand these responses\r\n    - (3) A college student could understand these responses\r\n    - (4) Someone training to become a doctor could understand these responses\r\n    - (5) Only experts, like doctors, can understand these responses\r\n3) How did the responses change with this new model? What's similar to before, and what's different?",
