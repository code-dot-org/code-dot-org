People can describe things they do in their day, and the chatbot should provide tips or suggestions for how to be mindful of the environment in these activities. It's important to not make people feel bad about their habits, otherwise they may stop listening to the advice of the chatbot.\r\n\r\n**Prepare:** What is your strategy for addressing this user? What aspects of a prompt will be most important?\r\n\r\n**Try:** Design a chatbot that meets the needs of this person\r\n\r\n**Reflect:** Test the chatbot! Have a conversation with at least 4 messages, then press the <code style=\"color:white; background-color:#7435b2\">Continue</code> button!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n::: details [**Click here to see example messages to try in this level**]\r\n* On my way to school each day, I stop by the drive-through coffee shop for my morning mocha\r\n* I know it's bad to waste food so I always finish my lunch\r\n:::\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",
