It could be used by someone studying for an exam or wanting to learn more about how their biology works.\r\n\r\nWe've been asked to evaluate how approachable the chatbot is - will it work for a student in a middle school biology and health class? Or is it better for advanced medical students becoming doctors?\r\n\r\n### Do This\r\n\r\n1) Test at least 4 prompts asking the chatbot to describe how one of your organs or muscles work in your body. For example:\r\n    - \"Describe the gall bladder and what it does in your body\"\r\n    - \"Describe the Circle of Willis and what it does in your body\"\r\n    - \"Describe the  liver and what it does in your body\"\r\n    - \"Describe the Choroid Plexus and what it does in your body\"\r\n2) Read over the responses and rate how understandable they are:\r\n    - (1) A small child could understand these responses\r\n    - (2) A high school student could understand these responses\r\n    - (3) A college student could understand these responses\r\n    - (4) Someone training to become a doctor could understand these responses\r\n    - (5) Only experts, like doctors, can understand these responses"
