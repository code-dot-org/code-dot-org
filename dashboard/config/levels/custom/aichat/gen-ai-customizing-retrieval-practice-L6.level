For example, when asking about famous scientists, the chatbot seemed to only respond with white men even though there's a diversity of renowned scientists. This is a situation that Retrieval can help with by adding information about diverse figured to the chatbot.\r\n\r\n### Do This\r\n\r\n1) Ask the chatbot for 3-5 examples of people famous in certain areas, and notice if a response includes a limited set of examples\r\n    * For example: \"Who are 5 famous scientists\" or \"Who are 3 astronauts who have gone to space\"\r\n2) Search for other famous people in these areas from more diverse backgrounds\r\n3) Find a description of these people and their accomplishments, then add them to Retrieval\r\n    * For example: looking for descriptions on Wikipedia\r\n4) Press the `Update`(#7435b2) button to save your work!\r\n5) Ask the chatbot the same questions and verify that the answers are updated to include the examples you've provided.",
