He can usually come up with one or two catchy lines for the song, but then will struggle to generate the rest of it. He wants a chatbot app that lets him type in one of his song lyrics, and then will generate a chorus based on the lyric and appropriate for his folk-loving listeners.\r\n\r\n**Prepare:** What is your strategy for addressing this user? What aspects of a prompt will be most important?\r\n\r\n**Try:** Design a chatbot that meets the needs of this person\r\n\r\n**Reflect:** Test the chatbot! Have a conversation with at least 4 messages, then press the <code style=\"color:white; background-color:#7435b2\">Continue</code> button!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n::: details [**Click here to see example messages to try in this level**]\r\n* I dreamed a dream of cloudy clouds\r\n* I left my heart in a heart-shaped box\r\n:::\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",
