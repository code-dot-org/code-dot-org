The user should be able to ask \"what are my rights when [X] happens?\" or \"what are my rights when I'm in [X]\" and the chatbot will respond. This requires very specific and accurate information, so Veronica has decided to use Retrieval to help her create the chatbot.\r\n\r\n### Do This\r\n1) Visit a website that helps people understand their rights in different situations\r\n    - For example: the [ACLU Know your Rights page](https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights) or the [CAIR Know your Rights Guides](https://www.cair.com/know_your_rights/download-know-your-rights-guides/)\r\n2) Decide on a situation or context that is meaningful for you\r\n    - For example: patient rights in the medical system, or your rights to free speech\r\n3) Create a system prompt that helps people understand these rights\r\n4) Add at least 5 pieces of retrieval based on your source.\r\n5) **Test the chatbot carefully!** This is a situation where incorrect information could be harmful to someone trying to use this chatbot.",
