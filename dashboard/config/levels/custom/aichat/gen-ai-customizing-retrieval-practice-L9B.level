The chatbot needs help knowing about recent successes or achievements to talk about, and it could use some local expertise from someone who attends the school (ie: you!) about the things that make it interesting.\r\n\r\nYour chatbot should include at least 5 pieces of retrieval information.\r\n\r\n**Alternative Task:** Instead of making this chatbot about school, you could alternatively make it about a club you're in or a class you really like or even a group you're a part of outside of school. The goals are still the same: it should help promote, and you'll need to provide some additional information via retrieval.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n::: details [**Some Tips to Consider on this Level**]\r\n* Consider giving the chatbot a specific role and tone\r\n* Consider finding recent accomplishments and using that as retrieval\r\n* Consider including your own personal experiences as retrieval\r\n:::\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",
