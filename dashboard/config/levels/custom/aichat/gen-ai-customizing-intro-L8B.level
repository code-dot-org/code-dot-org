Let's investigate how accurate it can be.\r\n\r\n### Do This\r\n\r\n1) Ask the chatbot to solve 4-5 different math problems\r\n    - These can be simple calculations, like \"What is 9 times 5 plus 4\"\r\n2) Read the response carefully and notice if any responses seem incorrect\r\n    - Hallucinations usually _sound_ correct in the context of the response, so it's important to read closely!\r\n3) Update the temperature and ask the same questions. Do the answers change? Does the accuracy change?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n::: details [**Click here to see example messages to try in this level**]\r\n* What is 9 times 5 plus 4?\r\n* If I have 55 dollars and I need to split it amongst 3 people, how much money does each person get?\r\n* If my meal costs $32.05 and there's a 1.02% tax and I want to tip 20%, what is my total bill?\r\n:::\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",
