For example, the 👋 and 👍 emojis can mean different things in different cultures - and sometimes they mean something offensive! <a href=\"https://pumble.com/blog/culture-emoji/\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more here</a>.\r\n\r\nMariah wants to use a chatbot to help make sure she has the right cultural norms and etiquette when visiting another country.\r\n\r\n### Do This\r\n\r\nSearch for information about the cultural do's and don'ts when visiting China to use as sources for the chatbot. For example: you may find details on international consulate websites or travel blogs. Then design a chatbot that offers advice on interacting with people while in China to not offend anyone or embarrass yourself.\r\n\r\n**A Note About Testing:** When testing the chatbot, don't ask questions like \"How do Chinese people do [X]\" - this is likely to generate biased stereotypes based on how language models are trained. Instead, ask questions like \"When in China, what is the proper way to [X]\" or \"What are things for tourists to avoid when doing [X] in China\".\r\n\r\n**Alternative Task:** Instead of making this chatbot specific to visiting China, you can substitute another country like Egypt, Ghana, India, or the US.",
