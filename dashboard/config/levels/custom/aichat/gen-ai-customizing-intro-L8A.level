Let's investigate how accurate it can be.\r\n\r\n### Do This\r\n\r\n1) Ask the chatbot to translate 4-5 sentences into a different language that you are familiar with.\r\n2) Read the response carefully and notice if any responses seem incorrect\r\n    - Hallucinations usually _sound_ correct in the context of the response, so it's important to read closely!\r\n3) Update the temperature and ask the same questions. Do the answers change? Does the accuracy change?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n::: details [**Click here to see example messages to try in this level**]\r\n* Can you translate \"Hello how are you?\" into Spanish?\r\n* Can you translate \"It is a beautiful day in the neighborhood\" into Korean?\r\n* Can you translate \"I remember it all too well\" into Arabic?\r\n:::\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",
