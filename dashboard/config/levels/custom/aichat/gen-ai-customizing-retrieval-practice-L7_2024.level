For this kind of chatbot, having accurate information is incredibly important, so Sam wants to use Retrieval to make sure the right facts are provided to the chatbot. Our job is to help Sam add this information to the chatbot.\r\n\r\n### Do This\r\n\r\n1) Find an online resource that provides information about voting in an upcoming local election.\r\n    - For example: see if your [county recorder website](https://www.recorder.pima.gov/BallotFAQs) or [secretary of state websites](https://azsos.gov/elections/voters/voting-elections) have election FAQs.\r\n2) Identify at least 5 pieces of information from these websites that should be included in the chatbot. Some examples might include:\r\n    - The date of the next election\r\n    - What identification is needed\r\n    - Rules for early voting or mail-in voting\r\n3) Add that information to the retrieval section of the chatbot. You can copy-and-paste directly from the website.\r\n4) Press the <code style=\"color:white; background-color:#7435b2\">Update</code> button to save your changes!\r\n5) Ask the chatbot questions and verify it gives accurate information based on what you've provided!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n::: details [**Click here to see example messages to try in this level**]\r\n* When is the date of the next election?\r\n* What forms of ID do I need when voting?\r\n* How can I participate in mail-in voting?\r\n:::\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",
