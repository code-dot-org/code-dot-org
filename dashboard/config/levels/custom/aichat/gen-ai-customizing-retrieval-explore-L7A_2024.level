It should include details that might not be easily accessible just by searching for information about your city - something you, as a local, know about that might not be obvious.\r\n\r\n### Do This\r\n\r\n1) Update the system prompt so it's about where you live (or a place you've lived before)\r\n2) Update the the retrieval statements so it's now a chatbot about where you live (or a place you’ve lived before). \r\n    - Be sure to include at least 5 retrieval statements.\r\n    - Retrieval statements should be 1-2 sentences at most\r\n\r\nTest the chatbot! Have a few different conversations and see how will it references your retrieval statements.
