She would like a chatbot where she can paste in one of these emails and it will generate a concise 3-bullet summary of the email with simplified language.\r\n\r\n**Prepare:** What is your strategy for addressing this user? What aspects of a prompt will be most important?\r\n\r\n**Try:** Design a chatbot that meets the needs of this person\r\n\r\n**Reflect:** Test the chatbot! Have a conversation with at least 4 messages, then press the <code style=\"color:white; background-color:#7435b2\">Continue</code> button!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n::: details [**Click here to see example messages to try in this level**]\r\n* _I hope this email finds you well. I am a microbiologist specializing in pathogenic microbial mechanisms, particularly focusing on virulence factors and host-pathogen interactions. I am keen on exploring potential collaborative opportunities to further our understanding of microbial pathogenesis. Could we schedule a meeting to discuss potential research synergies and avenues for collaboration?_\r\n* _I trust this correspondence finds you in good health and academic prosperity. As a fervent scholar entrenched in the domain of microbiology, specifically delving into the intricate realms of pathogenic microbial processes, with a pronounced emphasis on elucidating virulence factors and elucidating the complexities of host-pathogen interplay, I am impassioned by the prospect of forging synergistic alliances to augment our collective comprehension of microbial pathogenesis. Might I humbly beseech thee to consider the possibility of convening for a scholarly discourse? It is my ardent aspiration to engage in erudite discussions to explore potential avenues of mutual research endeavor and collaborative inquiry._\r\n:::\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n",
