But, the chatbot doesn't have some of the most recent movies that have come out even though those are some of the best ones to recommend. We need to use Retrieval to update the chatbot with information about these latest movies.\r\n\r\n### Do This\r\n\r\n1) Search for 5 movies that have come out in the last year\r\n    - You can find recent movies at https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/world/2024/\r\n2) Go to a website that provides movie summaries\r\n    - For example, searching for movies on https://wikipedia.org \r\n3) Copy-and-paste the plot summary of those movies into the Retrieval section of the chatbot\r\n4) Press the <code style=\"color:white; background-color:#7435b2\">Update</code> button to save your work!\r\n\r\nTest the chatbot! Ask it about some of the movies you added that were released recently. Also ask it about other new releases that you _didn't_ include to verify that the chatbot isn't aware of recent movie releases. When you're done, press the <code style=\"color:white; background-color:#7435b2\">Continue</code> button!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n::: details [**Click here to see example messages to try in this level**]\r\n* What is the plot of the latest Trolls movie?\r\n    * (without retrieval, the chatbot won’t know about Trolls Band Together released in 2023)\r\n* What is the plot of the latest Mission Impossible movie?\r\n    * (without retrieval, thet chatbot won’t know about Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning released in 2023)\r\n:::\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",
