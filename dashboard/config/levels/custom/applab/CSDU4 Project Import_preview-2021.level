This will be your copy of the app, and the copy that you will start to add code to in the next lesson.  (Don't forget that you'll also need to import your own screen into this project.)\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/5d65a02b58a119dffb36329404c1c6cf-image-1608041435242.png\" width=\"100px\" style=\"float: right\"/>\r\n\r\n* Collect all of the sharing urls for your team's pages, **including your own**. Each team member can find the share url for their own screen by going back to the [last level of the previous lesson](https://studio.code.org/s/csd4-2021/lessons/12/levels/11/) and clicking the Share button in the upper-left corner\r\n* Import each of the screens, one at a time\r\n\t* If you run into an ID error with one of the screens, discuss the issue with the screen's creator so it can be fixed and imported\r\n* Set the main screen as the default. Don't worry about adding any code at this point; we'll get to that in the next level.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/939ac3816bd5b5dfc2d796d27c4fcf37-image-1608041630703.png\" width=\"200px\"/>\r\n\r\n",

This and the next level can be quite time consuming, so if you are running short on time, consider jumping to the Screen Pair activity described in the Extension Activities for this lesson.\r\n\r\n#### Team Time\r\n\r\nThough students are working on their individual copies of their team app at this point, encourage teams to be active and vocal through this portion of the lesson. Any issues that students encounter when importing their teammates' screens can only be resolved through teamwork, and will likely be a problem for all members of the team.",
