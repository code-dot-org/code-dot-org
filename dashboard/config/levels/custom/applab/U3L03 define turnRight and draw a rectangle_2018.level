We've started you out with a stub that **defines** a function called `right()`.  Start by adding code inside the function definition that will turn the turtle to the right (by turning left three times) when called. \r\n\r\nThen **use** this function in some code to draw a rectangle, as shown below.  Make sure the turtle ends facing the same direction and in the same location it started. *Note that the rectangle below is 2 moveForwards tall and 1 moveForward wide*\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/fd6e8b4d2218a242bae19ac9c78b5d5f-image-1447799438050.gif)\r\n\r\n**Note**: Your program will still do the same thing.
