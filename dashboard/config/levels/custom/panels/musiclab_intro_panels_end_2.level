Be sure to explore the sound library - there is a lot to explore and use to make an amazing track.\n\nYou'll see even more new things in the toolbox, including:\n\n- A beat-making block\n- Sound effects like reverb and filter\n\n- A synthesizer block\n\n- A block for randomizing what gets played\n\n ...and more!
