  "content": "A canvas element is a rectangular area which you include in apps to allow the user to draw and manipulate images. The Turtle is actually implemented using a canvas.\n\ncanvas element must be created before using any other canvas blocks. If the width and height are not specified, the canvas will be the same size as the app window. Each time *createCanvas()* is invoked, it creates a new canvas with default values for stroke width (1), stroke color (\"black\"), and fill color (\"transparent\"). Changing those values only affects the active canvas, and only one canvas may be active at a time. Canvas blocks, such as [line()](/docs/applab/line) and [rect()](/docs/applab/rect), can draw only within the bounds of a canvas. Any drawing outside the bounds of the canvas will not be visible.\n\nWhen *createCanvas()* is invoked the first time, the canvas it creates becomes the active canvas. Other canvas blocks (like [line()](/docs/applab/line) or [setStrokeWidth()](/docs/applab/setStrokeWidth)) only affect the active canvas. Creating additional canvas elements does not change the active canvas. To change the active canvas, you must use [setActiveCanvas()](/docs/applab/setActiveCanvas).",

The x values increase as you move right, and y values increase as you go down.\n- Drawing outside of the dimensions of the canvas will not be visible. The dimensions span from 0 to the width of the canvas horizontally (x), and from 0 to the height of the canvas vertically (y).\n- A canvas is a UI element, so if it is assigned an id, then it can be manipulated with the UI Controls blocks.\n- Change the position of the canvas using [setPosition()](/docs/applab/setPosition).\n- The [setPosition](/docs/applab/setPosition) block can change the display size of the canvas, but it does not change the bounds of the canvas (the range of x and y values that are valid for drawing). Instead, the drawing within the canvas will be stretched (or squished) to fit the size specified."
