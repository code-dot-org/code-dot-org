Variables are simply names you use to refer to stored data in your apps.  You can name your variables whatever you want so long as the name is not already used by the system.  Variable names can not have spaces or special characters.  In practice, it is helpful to name your variables in a way that describes the value they store.  For instance, if the variable you create is to store a person's name you might name that variable personName.",

Scope refers to which blocks of code can access that variable by name.  For instance, if you declare a variable inside a function, that variable name can only be accessed inside that function. Variables declared at the top of your program are *global* and can be accessed anywhere in your program."
