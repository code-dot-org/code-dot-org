  "tips": "- [penDown()](/docs/applab/penDown) is often used with penUp. The default starting configuration for the turtle is with the pen down.\n- [dot()](/docs/applab/dot) is not effected by penUp.\n- Turtle drawing commands are not effected by the [show()](/docs/applab/show) and [hide()](/docs/applab/hide) commands, which control if the turtle icon is displayed or not.\n- If you are not seeing the turtle's movement, slow the program execution down by adjusting the tortoise/hare slider bar in the Debug Console or by using the [speed()](/docs/applab/speed) command."
