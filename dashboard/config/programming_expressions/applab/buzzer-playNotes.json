All of the notes are played as a whole note; if you want to change how long a particular note is played for, you can use the `buzzer.playSong()` method.\r\n\r\nThis method accepts two parameters: a one-dimensional array full of notes, and a tempo to play them at. Tempo is an optional parameter, but if left undefined defaults to 120bpm. ",
