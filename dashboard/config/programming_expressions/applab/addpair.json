  "content": "An object is a way to collect data and assign a unique label to each item. One example of a real-life object is a dictionary - every word has a corresponding definition. Here's how a dictionary would look as an App Lab object:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar dictionary = {\r\n\t\"tortilla\": \"a thin, flat pancake of cornmeal or flour, eaten hot or cold, typically with a savory filling as a part of Mexican cuisine.\",\r\n    \"naan\": \"a type of leavened bread, typically of teardrop shape and traditionally cooked in a clay oven as part of Indian cuisine.\",\r\n    \"injera\": \"a white leavened Ethiopian bread made from teff flour, similar to a crêpe.\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the example above, each word in the dictionary is the key - it's what you use to look up values in the dictionary. The definitions are the values - they are what are trying to look up in the dictionary.\r\n\r\nYou can add new elements to an object using `addPair`. You can think of this as a _pair_ of objects because you're adding two things: the key, and the value. In the dictionary example, this is like adding both the word and the definition to the dictionary:\r\n\r\n- \"crepe\": \"a thin pancake, used to make sweet or savory dishes. Crepes are common in Vietnamese cuisine\"\r\n\r\nWe could add this to our dictionary with the code:\r\n\r\n```\r\naddPair(dictionary, \"crepe\", \"a thin pancake, used to make sweet or savory dishes. Crepes are common in Vietnamese cuisine\")\r\n```",
