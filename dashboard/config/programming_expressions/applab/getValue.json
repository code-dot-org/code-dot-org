One example of a real-life object is a dictionary - every word has a corresponding definition. Here's how a dictionary would look as an App Lab object:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar dictionary = {\r\n\t\"tortilla\": \"a thin, flat pancake of cornmeal or flour, eaten hot or cold, typically with a savory filling as a part of Mexican cuisine.\",\r\n    \"naan\": \"a type of leavened bread, typically of teardrop shape and traditionally cooked in a clay oven as part of Indian cuisine.\",\r\n    \"injera\": \"a white leavened Ethiopian bread made from teff flour, similar to a crêpe.\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the example above, each word in the dictionary is the `key` - it's what you use to look up values in the dictionary. The definitions are the `values` - they are what are trying to look up in the dictionary. \r\n\r\nYou can use `getValue` to look up a value from its key. This would be like looking up the definition of a word in the dictionary.",
