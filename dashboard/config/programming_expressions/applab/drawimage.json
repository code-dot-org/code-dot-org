  "content": "The [`drawImage`(#f78183)](/docs/applab/drawImage/) function draws the element specified by `id` at position (x, y). The (x, y) position is relative to the top-left corner of the active canvas, and it specifies where to draw the top-left corner of the image. The [`Width`(#d3e965)](/docs/weblab/width/) and [`Height`(#d3e965)](/docs/weblab/height/) parameters are optional. If they are not provided, the image is drawn full-size. If width and height vaue are specified, then the image is stretched (or squished) to fit the size specified.\n\nAn image element can be created using [`image()`](/docs/applab/image). A second canvas can be created with [`createCanvas()`](/docs/applab/createCanvas).\n\n**Note**: A canvas element must exist before the image can be drawn. Create a canvas element in Design mode first, or call [`createCanvas()`](/docs/applab/createCanvas) before calling `drawImage()`.",
