For circle(), the x and y coordinates specify the center of the circle, relative to the top-left corner of the canvas (x:0 y:0). The radius is measured in pixels. Circles are drawn using the current stroke width and current stroke color, and then filled with the current fill color (if the fill color is anything other than the default \"transparent\").\n\n\n",

Create a canvas element in Design mode first, or call [createCanvas()](/docs/applab/createCanvas) before calling circle.\n- If you're having trouble getting a circle to show up, make sure that you're trying to draw the circle within the bounds of the active canvas.\n- Change the width of the line, color of the line, and fill color used to draw all subsequent circles using on this canvas [setStrokeWidth](/docs/applab/setStrokeWidth), [setStrokeColor](/docs/applab/setStrokeColor). and [setFillColor](/docs/applab/setFillColor).\n- When drawing thick lines, the radius of the circle defines the center of the perimeter line. The outside radius of the circle will be the specified radius plus half the stroke width."
