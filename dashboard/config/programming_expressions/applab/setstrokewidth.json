If there is more than one canvas, each one can have a different stroke width.\n- When a new canvas is created, its stroke width will be the default value of 1 pixel.\n- A canvas element must be created before the stroke width can be changed. Create a canvas element in Design mode first, or call [createCanvas()](/docs/applab/createCanvas) before calling *setStrokeWidth()*."
