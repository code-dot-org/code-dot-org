  "content": "Data drives the functionality of modern apps, and being able to analyze and learn something from that data is a valuable skill. Basic charts are used to see patterns and relataionships in data that you cannot see by just looking at the raw data.\n\nA chart screen element with the element ID of *chartId* must be added to your app in design mode. The available chart types are \"bar\", \"line\", \"pie\" and \"scatter\". *chartData\" is an array of JSON objects to use in the chart.\n\nBar Chart - The first attribute in the JSON object needs to contain strings (or unique numbers like years), which specify the names of the bars on the x-axis. The second JSON attribute (and subsequent attributes) needs to contain numbers, which determines the height if each bar with a certain color.\n\nLine Chart - The first attribute in the JSON object needs to contain strings (or unique numbers like years), which specify the names of the values on the x-axis. The second JSON attribute (and subsequent attributes) needs to contain numbers, which determines the y-axis values for each dot to connect with a certain color.\n\nPie Chart - The first attribute in the JSON object needs to contain strings (or unique numbers like years), which specify the names of the sections of the pie chart. The second JSON attribute needs to contain numbers, which determines the percentage amount of the pie chart it gets.\n\nScatter Chart - The first attribute in the JSON object needs to contain strings (or unique numbers like years), which specify the names of the values on the x-axis. The second JSON attribute (and subsequent attributes) needs to contain numbers, which determines the y-axis values for each dot with a certain color.\n",
