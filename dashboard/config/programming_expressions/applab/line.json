  "content": "You can draw many things with the basic canvas drawing functions of circle, line and rect. For line(), the (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) coordinates specify the endpoints of the line, relative to the top-left corner of the canvas (x:0 y:0). Lines are drawn using the current stroke width and current stroke color.\n\nWhen drawing thick lines, the line coordinates define the center of the line. The ends of the line will be rounded, forming semi-circles beyond the ends of the line.",
