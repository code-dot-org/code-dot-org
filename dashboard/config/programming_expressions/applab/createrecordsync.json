The object cannot have an \"id\" property. The record created in the table is then returned as a parameter to the callback function. Data is only accessible to the app that created the table. To View your app's table data, click 'View data' in App Lab and click the table name you want to view.",

  "tips": "### Tips\r\n\r\n- The javascript object properties must match the App Lab table column names. Both are case sensitive.\r\n- Duplicate records are allowed in a table but will have different id values assigned automatically.\r\n- Use with [readRecords()](/docs/applab/readRecords/), [deleteRecord()](/docs/applab/deleteRecord/), and [updateRecord()](/docs/applab/updateRecord/) records to view, delete, and update records in a table."
