  "tips": "- If you want to test if a value is less than, you can use the [<](/docs/applab/lessThenOperator) operator.\n- JavaScript will automatically perform type conversion for you when comparing two values (e.g. the integer 5 will register as equivalent to the string \\\"5\\\").\n- When comparing two strings, JavaScript will compare them alphabetically based on character by character comparison left to right. All the upper case letters come before the lower case letters.\n- Comparison operators include < <= == > >= !="
