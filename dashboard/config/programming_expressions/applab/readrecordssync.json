The apps you use everyday are driven by data \"in the cloud\".\n\n**First time using App Lab table data storage?** Read a short overview of what it is and how to use it [here](/docs/concepts/tableDataStorage/).\n\nYou can request a subset of records to be returned using the terms parameter, which must be a javascript object variable or a javascript object defined using curly brace and colon notation (see examples below). Terms can be used to read records with exact matches to columns of a record. To retrieve all records, an empty object is passed as the *terms* parameter. Data is only accessible to the app that created the table. \n\nTo View your app's table data, click 'View data' in App Lab and click the table name you want to view.\n",
