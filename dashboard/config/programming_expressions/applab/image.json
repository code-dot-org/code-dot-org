You can add images to your apps, and even make them dynamic, responding to user interaction. An event handler must be created for each type of user interaction with an image using [`onEvent()`(#fff176)](/docs/applab/onEvent/) and the *id*. There are two ways to fill in the url string for the second parameter.\n\n**1. Copy the URL of an image on the web.**\nIn most browsers you can simply *right-click (ctrl+click on a Mac)* on an image and you'll see a menu with a few option.

This will insert the name of the file into the URL field.  Because you have uploaded it, it doesn't need to be an HTTP reference.\n\n",
