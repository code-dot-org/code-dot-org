  "content": "Makes the buzzer play at a specific frequency and duration.\n\n[`buzzer.frequency()`(#f78183)](/docs/applab/buzzer.frequency/) determines what tone the buzzer will play, and for how long this tone will play for. This command is more customizable than `.note()` because you can choose the frequency you want up to around 500hz (About the 4th octave on the musical scale). Any frequency above 1000hz cannot play on the buzzer.\n\n[`buzzer.frequency()`(#f78183)](/docs/applab/buzzer.frequency/) has a parameter for duration too. If the duration is not specified, then the tone will play continuously.\n",
