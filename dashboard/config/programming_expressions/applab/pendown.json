  "tips": "- [penUp()](/docs/applab/penUp) is often used with penDown. \n- The default starting configuration for the turtle is with the pen down.\n- The color and width of the turtle line can be changed using [penColor(color)](/docs/applab/penColor) and [penWidth(width)](//docs/applab/penWidth).\n- Turtle drawing commands are not effected by the [show()](/docs/applab/show) and [hide()](/docs/applab/hide) commands, which control if the turtle icon is displayed or not.\n- If you are not seeing the turtle's movement, slow the program execution down by adjusting the tortoise/hare slider bar in the Debug Console or by using the [speed()](/docs/applab/speed) command."
