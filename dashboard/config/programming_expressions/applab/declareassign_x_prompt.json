  "content": "Many apps process data. To be able to process data your apps need to keep track of the data in memory. Variables are simply names you use to refer to stored data in your apps. You can name your variables whatever you want so long as the name is not already used by the system. Variable names can not have spaces or special characters. In practice, it is helpful to name your variables in a way that describes the value they store. For instance, if the variable you create is to store a person's name you might name that variable personName.\n\nTo process data in our apps we need to assign values to memory locations we have previously named using var to declare a variable. The prompt() function causes a pop-up window to display with the given message and the app waits for the user to type something in and click OK. The variable getting the value always goes on the left hand side of the assignment operator =.",

  "tips": "- Whatever the user types in the pop-up window is stored as a string in the variable. However, Javascript will convert a string of a number to a number if you use it in an arithmetic equation. See the change counting example above.\n- The block of code where you declare the variable defines the variable's scope. Scope refers to which blocks of code can access that variable by name. For instance, if you declare a variable inside a function, that variable name can only be accessed inside that function. Variables declared at the top of your program are global and can be accessed anywhere in your program.\n- Excessive use of prompt() can get annoying, use this sparingly."
