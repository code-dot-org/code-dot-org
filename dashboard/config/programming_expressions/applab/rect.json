  "content": "You can draw many things with the basic canvas drawing functions of circle, line and rect. For rect(), the x and y coordinates specify the upper left of the rectangle, relative to the top-left corner of the canvas (x:0 y:0). The width and height are measured in pixels. Rectangles are drawn using the current stroke width and current stroke color, and then filled with the current fill color (if the fill color is anything other than the default \"transparent\").",

  "tips": "- A canvas element must exist before a rectangle can be drawn. Create a canvas element in Design mode first, or call [`createCanvas()`](/docs/applab/createCanvas) before calling rect().\n- If you're having trouble getting a rectangle to show up, make sure a canvas is created first and that where you're trying to draw the rectangle fits within the coordinates of the canvas.\n- Change the width of the line, color of the line, and fill color used to draw all subsequent rectangles on this canvas using [setStrokeWidth](/docs/applab/setStrokeWidth), [setStrokeColor](/docs/applab/setStrokeColor). and [setFillColor](/docs/applab/setFillColor).\n- When drawing thick lines, the width and length of the rectangle is relative to the center of the perimeter line. The outside perimeter of the rectangle will be one half the stroke width larger all around."
