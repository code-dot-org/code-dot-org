For volume, this means the function should be played at a full volume.\n- medium: For volume, this reduces the loudness slightly. For filter, this adds a small amount of the effect. For delay, this adds a noticeable echo.\n- low: For volume, this plays the function's sounds quietly. For filter, this muffles the sound, e.g. only plays the 'low' parts of the sounds. For delay, this adds a small amount of echo."
