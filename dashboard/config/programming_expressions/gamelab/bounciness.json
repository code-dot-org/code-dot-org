A value of 0 is perfectly inelastic, no bouncing. A value between 0 and 1 is inelastic, this is the most common in nature. A value greater than 1 is hyper-elastic, velocity is increased like in a pinball bumper\r\n\r\nThe default bounciness is 1. All sprite properties can be both accessed and updated.",
