Use `textFont()` and `textSize()` to change the default font, Arial, and the default size, 12 pixels. Use `textAlign()` to change where the text is displayed relative to the (x,y) position specified. The default is that (x,y) is the top left corner of the text.\r\n\r\nText that does not fit completely within the display area will not be drawn or seen.
