For arc(), the x and y coordinates specify the center of the arc, relative to the top-left corner of the display area (x:0 y:0). The width and height of the rectangle that the arc is inscribed in are measured in pixels. The start parameter specifies what angle in degrees to start the arc at, 0 degrees is to the right. The stop parameter specifies what angle in degrees to end the arc in a clockwise direction from start.\r\n\r\nArcs are drawn using the current stroke weight and current stroke color, and then filled with the current fill color (unless [`noStroke()`(#4dd0e1)](/docs/gamelab/noStroke/) or [`noFill()`(#4dd0e1)](/docs/gamelab/noFill/) commands have been run).",

  "tips": "- If you're having trouble getting a ellipse to show up, make sure that [`noFill()`(#4dd0e1)](/docs/gamelab/noFill/) or [`noStroke()`(#4dd0e1)](/docs/gamelab/noStroke/) haven't been called, and where you're trying to draw the ellipse fits within the coordinates of the display (400 x 400).\r\n- Anything you draw will overlap previous things you drew. The sequence of drawing statements is usually important.\r\n- The default stroke is black, the default stroke weight is 1 pixel, and the default fill is gray. Change the width of the line, color of the line, and fill color used to draw all subsequent shapes using [`strokeWeight()`(#4dd0e1)](/docs/gamelab/strokeWeight/), [`stroke()`(#4dd0e1)](/docs/gamelab/stroke/), and [`fill()`(#4dd0e1)](/docs/gamelab/fill/).\r\n- When drawing thick lines, the width and length of the arc is relative to the center of the perimeter line. The outside perimeter of the arc will be one half the stroke weight larger all around."
