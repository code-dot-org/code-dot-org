  "content": "Draws a regular polygon (all sides equal, all angles equal) onto the display centered at x and y.\r\n\r\nYou can draw many things with the commands in the Drawing drawer of your Game Lab toolbox. For regularPolygon(), the x and y coordinates specify the center of the regular polygon, relative to the top-left corner of the display area (x:0 y:0). The third parameter is the number of sides  for the regular polygon, and the last parameter is the distance from the center to each vertex. Regular polygons are drawn using the current stroke weight and current stroke color, and then filled with the current fill color (unless `noStroke()` or `noFill()` commands have been run).",

  "tips": "- If you're having trouble getting a regular polygon to show up, make sure that `noFill()` or `noStroke()` haven't been called, and where you're trying to draw the regular polygon fits within the coordinates of the display (400 x 400).\r\n- Anything you draw will overlap previous things you drew. The sequence of drawing statements is usually important.\r\n- The default stroke is black, the default stroke weight is 1 pixel, and the default fill is gray. Change the width of the line, color of the line, and fill color used to draw all subsequent shapes using `strokeWeight()`, `stroke()`, and `fill()`.\r\n- When drawing thick lines, the size of the regular polygon is relative to the center of the perimeter line. The outside perimeter of the regular polygon will be one half the stroke weight larger all around."
