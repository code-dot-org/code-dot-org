  "tips": "- All four of the collisions are similar to including an \"if (sprite.isTouching(target))\" in the `draw` function, and then depending on the collision type, updating the sprite and target `velocityX` and `velocityY` properties.\r\n- Only one of the four types of collisions should be specified for each pair of sprites.\r\n- To fine tune your collision detection use `setCollider` to change the shape and size of the collider area and set `debug` to true for the sprites.\r\n- A sprite that is not visible can still collide with other sprites and user mouse interactions."
