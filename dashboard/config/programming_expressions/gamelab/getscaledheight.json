If no image or animation are set, it’s the scaled height of the placeholder rectangle.\r\n\r\nThe `sprite.scale` property can be used to scale a sprite larger or smaller and keep the height to width ratio constant.

  "tips": "- If sprite is scaled, `sprite.width` and `sprite.height` are not changed. Use `getScaledWidth()` and `getScaledHeight()` instead.\r\n- If `setCollider()` is called for a sprite before it is scaled, the collider is not scaled. But if a sprite is first scaled and then the collider set, the scale is also applied to the collider. "
