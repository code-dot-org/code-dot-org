Most programming languages have an *if statement*: to check to see if some expression is true, and if it is do something. \n\nAn *if statement* requires you to define an expression that evaluates to true or false. Just as in arithmetic there are some operators you can use to write expressions that evaluate to a number, programming languages also have a comparison operators (< <= == > >= !=) and boolean operators (&& || !) that let you write expressions that evaluate to true or false.\n\nThe *if statement* defines a block of code to execute between open and closing curly braces {}. If the condition is true then the block of code inside the curly braces is executed from top to bottom, exactly once. If the condition is false then the entire block of code is ignored.\n\n",
