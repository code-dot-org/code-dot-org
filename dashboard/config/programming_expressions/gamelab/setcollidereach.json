  "tips": "- When your games have complex interactions between sprites or the mouse set [`sprite.debug`(#f78183)](/docs/gamelab/debug/) to true so the sprite is shown with the outline of the collider, the depth, and center.\r\n- If `setColliderEach()` is called for a sprite before it is scaled, the collider is not scaled. But if a sprite is first scaled and then the collider set, the scale is also applied to the collider.\r\n- Groups of sprites all have the same functions and you use the dot notation (combining the name of the group, followed by a dot, with the function name) to call the function for that group of sprites.\r\n- Any changes to the properties of a sprite will not be seen until after `drawSprites()` is called."
