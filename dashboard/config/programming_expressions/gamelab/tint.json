This tint doesn't change the existing colors of a sprite, but is more like putting a pane of colored glass over the top of the sprite. Because of this, you may find that sprites with bold or dark colors become darker when you apply a tint.\r\n\r\nYou can assign the tint color in a number of ways, including:\r\n\r\n- A string containing a named HTML color, such as \"orange\" or \"teal\".  A full list of color names can be found at [W3 Schools - Colors](http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp)\r\n- A string containing a hexadecimal color, such as \"#FF7700\" or \"#00ADBC\"\r\n- An RGB string, like \"rgb(255, 0, 127)\";",

  "tips": "- A full list of color names can be found at [W3 Schools - Colors](http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp).\r\n- For more specific color selection, or to randomize color selection, use `gamelab/rgb()` as a parameter to fill instead of a color name.\r\n- You can make a sprite transparent by giving it a tint with alpha transparency (using the fourth optional parameter of `gamelab/rgb()`). If you want to make a sprite semi-transparent without changing it's color, use white as the tint color with an additional alpha transparency parameter (eg `gamelab/rgb(255, 255, 255, 0.5)` for 50% transparent).\r\n- Sprites all have the same properties and you use the dot notation (combining the name of the sprite, followed by a dot, with the label of the property) to both access and update the property for that sprite.\r\n- Any changes to the properties of a sprite will not be seen until after `drawSprites()` is called."
