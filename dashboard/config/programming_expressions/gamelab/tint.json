A full list of color names can be found at [W3 Schools - Colors](http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp)\r\n- A string containing a hexadecimal color, such as \"#FF7700\" or \"#00ADBC\"\r\n- An RGB string, like \"rgb(255, 0, 127)\";",

  "tips": "- A full list of color names can be found at [W3 Schools - Colors](http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp).\n- For more specific color selection, or to randomize color selection, use [`gamelab/rgb()`(#4dd0e1)](/docs/gamelab/rgb/) as a parameter to fill instead of a color name.\n- You can make a sprite transparent by giving it a tint with alpha transparency (using the fourth optional parameter of [`gamelab/rgb()`(#4dd0e1)](/docs/gamelab/rgb/)). If you want to make a sprite semi-transparent without changing it's color, use white as the tint color with an additional alpha transparency parameter (eg [`gamelab/rgb(255, 255, 255, 0.5)`(#4dd0e1)](/docs/gamelab/rgb/) for 50% transparent).\n- Sprites all have the same properties and you use the dot notation (combining the name of the sprite, followed by a dot, with the label of the property) to both access and update the property for that sprite.\n- Any changes to the properties of a sprite will not be seen until after [`drawSprites()`(#fff176)](/docs/gamelab/drawSprites/) is called."
