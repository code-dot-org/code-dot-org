  "content": "Apps usually need to make decisions and execute some code *if* something is true and some other code otherwise. Most programming languages have an *if/else statement*: to check to see if some expression is true, and if it is do something, otherwise do something else. \n\nAn *if/else statement* requires you to define an expression that evaluates to true or false. Just as in arithmetic there are some operators you can use to write expressions that evaluate to a number, programming languages also have a comparison operators (< <= == > >= !=) and boolean operators (&& || !) that let you write expressions that evaluate to true or false.\n\nThe *if/else statement* defines two blocks of code to execute between open and closing curly braces {}. If the condition is true then the block of code inside the first curly braces is executed from top to bottom, exactly once. If the condition is false then then the block of code inside the second curly braces is executed from top to bottom, exactly once.",
