The sequence of drawing statements is usually important.\r\n- The default stroke is black, the default stroke weight is 1 pixel, and the default fill is gray. Change the width of the line, color of the line, and fill color used to draw all subsequent shapes using [`strokeWeight()`(#4dd0e1)](/docs/gamelab/strokeWeight/), [`stroke()`(#4dd0e1)](/docs/gamelab/stroke/), and [`fill()`(#4dd0e1)](/docs/gamelab/fill/).\r\n- When drawing thick lines, the size of the shape is relative to the center of the perimeter line. The outside perimeter of the shape will be one half the stroke weight larger all around."
