For `rect()`, the x and y coordinates specify the upper left of the rectangle, relative to the top-left corner of the display area (x:0 y:0). The width and height are measured in pixels. Rectangles are drawn using the current stroke weight and current stroke color, and then filled with the current fill color (unless `noStroke()` or `noFill()` commands have been run).",

  "tips": "- If you're having trouble getting a rectangle to show up, make sure that `noFill()` or `noStroke()` haven't been called, and where you're trying to draw the rectangle fits within the coordinates of the display (400 x 400).\r\n- Anything you draw will overlap previous things you drew. The sequence of drawing statements is usually important.\r\n- The default stroke is black, the default stroke weight is 1 pixel, and the default fill is gray. Change the width of the line, color of the line, and fill color used to draw all subsequent shapes using `strokeWeight()`, `stroke()`. and `fill()`.\r\n- When drawing thick borders, the width and length of the rectangle is relative to the center of the perimeter line. The outside perimeter of the rectangle will be one half the stroke weight larger all around."
