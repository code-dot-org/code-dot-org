Setting zoom to 0.5 will zoom out make everything half size. All camera properties can be both accessed and updated.\r\n\r\nThe camera enables scrolling and zooming for scenes extending beyond the display area. A camera has a position, a zoom factor, and mouse coordinates relative to the view. The camera is automatically created and available for use.",
