For loops are different than repeat loops because they use a counter variable to track a value. That value can then be used in the code inside the block.\r\n\r\nThe counter variable begins with the starting value. Each time the program goes through the loop, the sequence of code inside the block is run. The step value is then added to the counter variable, and the loop continues to run until the counter reaches the stopping value. Once the for loop is finished, the program will continue where it left off.\r\n\r\n**Examples:**\r\n \r\nfor **counter** from **1** to **4** count by **1**  \r\nThe loop will run 4 times.\r\n\r\n1. counter = 1\r\n\r\n2. counter = 2\r\n\r\n3. counter = 3\r\n\r\n4. counter = 4\r\n\r\nfor **counter** from **3** to **9** count by **3**  \r\nThe loop will run 3 times.\r\n\r\n1. counter = 3\r\n\r\n2. counter = 6\r\n\r\n3. counter = 9",

For example, if a counter starts at 3, ends at 6, and has an interval of 2, the loop will run twice - when the counter value is 3 and 5. The counter will end with a value of 7, but the loop will not run again because it is greater than the stopping value. "
