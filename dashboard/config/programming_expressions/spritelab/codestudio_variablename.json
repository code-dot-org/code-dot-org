  "content": "Gets the value of the specified variable. \r\n\r\nVariables are used as placeholders for values such as numbers or words. Variables allow for a lot of freedom in programming. Instead of having to type out a phrase many times or remember a number, computer scientists can use variables to reference them. Variable values can change throughout a program. Each time the variable name is used, it gets the current value of the given variable and passes it to the block it is attached to. ",
