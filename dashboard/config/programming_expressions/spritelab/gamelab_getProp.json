This block has many uses, such as making a sprite properties match or debugging the code.\r\n\r\n- Size - the size of the sprite as a percentage. 100 is the full, default size. \r\n- Rotation - the clockwise rotation in degrees of the sprite\r\n- X position - the x position of the center of the sprite\r\n- Y position - the y position of the center of the sprite \r\n- Movement direction - the direction angle the sprite moves in. 0 moves the sprite forward (east) and 180 moves the sprite backward (west).\r\n- Tint - the tint, or color, overlayed on the sprite. The color may overlap and mix with the sprite’s existing color.\r\n",
