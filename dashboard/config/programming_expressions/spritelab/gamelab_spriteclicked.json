In this case, when a sprite is clicked, the blocks attached under the event block will begin to run sequentially. If the [`costume`(#df9399)](/docs/spritelab/gamelab_allSpritesWithAnimation/) block is used here, the code will run whenever any sprite with the matching costume is clicked.\n\nThis block has a drop-down menu with “when” and “while” options. “When” a sprite is clicked, the code will only run once. “While” a sprite is clicked, the code will run over and over again until the sprite stops being clicked on.
