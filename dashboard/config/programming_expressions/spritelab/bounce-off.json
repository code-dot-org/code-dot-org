  "tips": "* If a sprite’s is programmed with [`move in direction`(#5ef3ff)](/docs/spritelab/gamelab_moveInDirection/) blocks, this block does not change those directions in the code. This block will not affect the direction of sprites moving with behaviors such as “moving east”.\r\n* This block works best under the [`sprite touches sprite`(#62fc94)](/docs/spritelab/gamelab_whenTouching/) event for sprites with behaviors that use the [`move forward`(#5ef3ff)](/docs/spritelab/gamelab_moveForward/) block such as “wandering” or “swimming left and right”.\r\n"
