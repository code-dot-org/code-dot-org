  "tips": "* If a sprite’s is programmed with `move in direction` blocks, this block does not change those directions in the code. This block will not affect the direction of sprites moving with behaviors such as “moving east”.\r\n* This block works best under the `sprite touches sprite` event for sprites with behaviors that use the `move forward` block such as “wandering” or “swimming left and right”.\r\n"
