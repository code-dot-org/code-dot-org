When you *call* a function you are telling the computer to run that set of actions.\r\n\r\nClick `Create a Function` to define a new function. A pop-up will open that takes a function name, description of what the function does, and the code blocks for the function.  Basically, when you define a function you give a name to a group of code you want the computer to perform. The new function will show up in the function toolbox.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CreateFunction_02vtqz1.png\" height=175px>\r\n\r\nClicking on the `edit` button in any function block will reopen the pop-up and allow the function to be edited or deleted.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/FunctionExample.png\" height=250px>",

  "tips": "- The purpose of a function is to help you organize your code and to avoid writing the same code twice. You can you define a function once, and then call the function a number of times.\r\n- Make sure your function name is descriptive. It should be easy to understand what a behavior does without having to look at its code.\r\n- You can call a function within the definition of another function."
