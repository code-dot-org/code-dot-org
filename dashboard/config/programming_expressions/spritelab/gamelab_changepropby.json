  "content": "Changes the property of a sprite or group of sprites by a given value.\n\nSprites have several properties that allow them to be changed and customized. These properties can be changed throughout a project. \n\n- Size - the size of the sprite by percentage. 100 is the full, default size. Any number less than 100 makes the sprite smaller, and any number larger will make the sprite bigger.\n- Rotation - the direction or rotation the sprite is facing in degrees, 0 to 359.\n- x position - the x position of the center of the sprite. To remain on the canvas, this should be a number between 0 and 400. 0 is the normal default direction.\n- y position - the y position of the center of the sprite. To remain on the canvas, this should be a number between 0 and 400. 0 is the normal default direction.\n- Movement direction - the direction the sprite travels with the [`move forward`(#5ef3ff)](/docs/spritelab/gamelab_moveForward/) block. 0 is the default value and moves the sprite right (east). 180 moves the sprite left (west).\n- Hue - the shade of a color. 0 is the original color and 99 goes back to the original color. Any number in between is a different color, created by offsetting the original color by whatever value specified in the argument. (The larger the number, the more different the color is).\n- Saturation - the intensity of a color. 0 is white, and 99 is the original color. Any number in between is a lighter shade of the original color.\n- Brightness - how light or dark a color is. 0 is black (complete darkness) and 99 is the original color (complete brightness). Any number in between is a darker shade of the original color. \n\nUsing this block will add the specified value to the selected property.\n",
