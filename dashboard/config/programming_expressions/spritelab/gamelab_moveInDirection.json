  "tips": "- The block makes the sprite move the given number of pixels only once. To make the sprite continuously move in a direction, set the block to “while key pressed” instead “when key pressed” so that the sprite will move the number of pixels over and over again while the key is pressed.\r\n- Any math block can be used in place of the number block."
