In this case, when a specific sprite touches another specific sprite, the blocks attached under the event block will begin to run sequentially. If the [`costume`(#df9399)](/docs/spritelab/gamelab_allSpritesWithAnimation/) block is used in either parameter, the event will check for touches between any sprites of the matching costume(s).\n\nThis block has a drop-down menu with “when” and “while” options. “When” a sprite touches another sprite, the code will only run once. “While” a sprite is touching another sprite, the code will run over and over again until the sprites stop touching.
