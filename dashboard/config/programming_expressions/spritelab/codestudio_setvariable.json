Instead of having to type out a phrase many times or remember a number, computer scientists can use variables to reference them. Variable values can change throughout a program.\r\n\r\nIf no variable with the specified name has been created, this block can create a new named variable with the given value. If the variable already exists, its new value will replace its old value.",

Choosing to “rename all” variables with that name will automatically rename all the matching blocks used in your project."
