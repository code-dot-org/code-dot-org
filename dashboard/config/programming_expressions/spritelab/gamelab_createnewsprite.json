This is useful for creating a special sprite that you will want to refer to by name throughout your program. This block also customizes how the sprite looks and where it starts on the display. The drop down menu gives a variety of sprite costumes to choose from and also has the option to draw a costume. A location block can be attached at the end of the block to control where the sprite will appear on the display. ",
