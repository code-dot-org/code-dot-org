  "tips": "- Connect this block to events like `sprite clicked`. Code is executed quickly in Sprite Lab. If you tell a sprite to begin a behavior and then tell it to stop in the same sequence of code, there is not enough time to see the behavior in action.\r\n- This block can be used along with `set sprite property`, `jump to` and `change color` to restore a sprite to its initial state, which can be useful in games and simulations that can be “reset”.\r\n"
