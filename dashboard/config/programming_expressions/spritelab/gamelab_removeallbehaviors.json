If you tell a sprite to begin a behavior and then tell it to stop in the same sequence of code, there is not enough time to see the behavior in action.\r\n- This block can be used along with [`set sprite property`(#5ef3ff)](/docs/spritelab/gamelab_setProp/), [`jump to`(#5ef3ff)](/docs/spritelab/gamelab_jumpTo/) and [`change color`(#5ef3ff)](/docs/spritelab/gamelab_setTint/) to restore a sprite to its initial state, which can be useful in games and simulations that can be “reset”.\r\n"
