If the condition is true, the sequence of code inside of the block will run. If the condition is false, the code will be skipped over. \r\n\r\nClicking on the star brings up options to add “else if” and “else” conditions. “Else if” allows multiple conditions to be checked. If the first “if” condition is not true, the program will go down the line and check for the first “else if” condition that is true. If none of the conditions are true, and an “else” section exists, then the code inside of “else” will run. ",
