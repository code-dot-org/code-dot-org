  "tips": "- Connect [`hide title screen`(#acd2c6)](/docs/spritelab/gamelab_hideTitleScreen/) blocks to events like [`sprite clicked`(#62fc94)](/docs/spritelab/gamelab_spriteClicked/) to control the time the screen is shown. Code is executed quickly in Sprite Lab. If you show the title screen and then hide it in the same sequence of code, there is not enough time to see the screen in action."
