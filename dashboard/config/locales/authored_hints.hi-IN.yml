          If this seems like too much to do, try breaking it down into steps:

          1)  Have the actor change to a random size on click.
          2) Play a random sound when you click the actor.

          Now, make sure both of those actions are attached underneath the same event!

        harvey_tictactoe: You can use `jump` blocks to move to other spaces.
      level 'grade3_Loops_10_authored_hint:
        2-3_Bee_Loops_4_a: You should end up with five blocks inside your loop.
      level 'grade3_Loops_11_authored_hint:
        2-3_Bee_Loops_5_a: If you can't spot the blocks to put inside `repeat` right
          away, start by coding out each move and look for a pattern.
      level 'grade3_Loops_12_authored_hint:
        2-3_Bee_Loops_6_a: If you can't tell what should go into the `repeat` loop,
          try dragging blocks out one by one and see if you can find a pattern.
        2-3_Bee_Loops_6_b: There should be 6 blocks inside your `repeat` loop when
          you're done.
      level 'grade3_Loops_4_authored_hint:
        2-3_Bee_Loops_3B_a: You will need two different `repeat` loops, one after
          the other.
      level 'grade3_Loops_5_authored_hint:
        2-3_Bee_Loops_7_a: The first action will be a turn, rather than a move.
        2-3_Bee_Loops_7_b: 'If you can''t quite picture the loop from the beginning,
          try coding it out the long way, then look for a pattern.  '

        2-3_Bee_Loops_4A_a: The first action will be a turn, rather than a move.
        2-3_Bee_Loops_4A_b: The last piece of the program can be finished by writing
          code at the end of your program outside of your loop.
        2-3_Bee_Loops_4A_c: If you can't spot the loops yet, try coding it out the
          long way first, then see what you can combine into a `repeat` loop at the
          end.
      level 'grade3_Loops_8_authored_hint:
        2-3_Bee_Loops_2_a: You should end up with four blocks inside your loop.

        2-3_Bee_Loops_3_a: You should have 6 blocks inside your loop.

          The bee is looping these actions over and over again:
          - move forward
          - make honey
          - turn left
          - move forward
          - turn right
      sample6_authored_hint:
        sample6_a: Did you know that you can use more than one repeat loop in a puzzle?
        sample6_b: Sometimes repeat loops have lots of blocks inside, and sometimes
          they might only have one!
