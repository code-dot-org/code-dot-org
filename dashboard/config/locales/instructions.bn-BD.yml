      Course 4 Play Lab Params 1_instruction: |-
        Here's a function called `jump` that
        causes your main character to jump up 100 pixels. Run the program and use
        the jump function to collect all of the flags by moving the dog with the arrow

        Now we've got flags that are too

        so that we can have multiple jump heights.  \r
        \r
        We need to add a parameter
        to our jump function called "height".  The up arrow should cause the dog
        to jump 200 pixels and the down arrow should make it jump only 100 pixels.

        Edit the the "patrol" function to
        add an "actor" parameter, so that we can call it for each of the actors
        on the screen. Remember, the actors correspond to numbers 1, 2, and 3.
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 6_instruction: |-
        Add another parameter called "speed"

        NOTE:
        You don't need to make any changes to the program
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 8_instruction: |-
        Use the `when actor touches` block
        to send Dog back to the top-left ONLY if Dog touches any of the other actors.

        The race in that last puzzle wasn't
        very fair! Change the `dog_speed` variable to make sure you can collect more

      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 3_instruction: |-
        Use the left and right arrows to move,
        and the up arrow to jump. See if you can collect all of the flags.

        Now we're using a variable called "height"

        Nice, now let's make sure this game

        Use a loop to collect the nectar
        from each flower.
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 10_instruction: |-
        Use your for loop "counter" variable
        to control how far to move horizontally.
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 10a_instruction: |-
        Ready for a challenge?  Take what
        you've learned about loops and try to solve this problem. Remember: You may
        have to run through solutions multiple times before you figure out all of
        the steps.
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 11_instruction: |-
        Can you use the loop variable to
        control movement and nectar collection?
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 2_instruction: |-
        Add the code necessary to make sure
        the bee collects all the nectar. Look at how much code you need for this puzzle!
        (We'll learn a simpler way in the next puzzle.)
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 3_instruction: "Ah, the \"for loop\" makes this\nmuch
        easier! All the code you need is here, take a look at how it is put together\nthen
        click \"Run\" to see how it works. "
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 4 4_instruction: |-
        Now we need to move forward "counter"
        times, then get nectar "counter" times.  Can you use two "repeat" loops
        to solve this challenge?
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 4_instruction: "Replace the ??? in the \"for loop\"\nwith
        the largest amount of nectar the bee has to collect. "
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 5 5_instruction: |-
        Are you getting the hang of using
        the "for loop"? Let's help the bee get the rest of the nectar.
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 5_instruction: |-
        You can also use a "for loop"
        to count down. Try gathering this nectar by counting down from 5 to 1 by 1.
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 6_instruction: |-
        The last number in your for loop
        is called the "increment". Each time the loop is run, the counter variable
        changes by the value of the increment. Try collecting these flowers using
        an increment of 2.
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 7_instruction: |-
        Now, let's combine the "counter"
        variable with a math block! How can you use the "counter" variable to navigate
        this garden with the fewest number of blocks possible? What do you need to
        do to collect 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 nectar this time? The secret is in the "counter"
        variable!\r
        \r
        Remember: If your loop is counting up, the increment is added
        to your "counter" variable each time through.
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 8_instruction: |-
        You've got this! What should your
        increment be to collect 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 nectar?
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 9_instruction: |-
        If your loop is counting down, the
        increment is subtracted from your counter variable each loop. What should
        your increment be to collect 15, then 12, then 9, 6, 3 nectar?
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 95_instruction: |-
        Take a look at each piece of the
        "for loop" that you have just created.  Can you figure out which numbers
        you need to double to solve this puzzle? Why does it work?

      Pixelation - Lesson 15 - Color Free Play_instruction: |-
        Requirements: The icon
        must be 16x16 pixels. You must use the Pixelation Widget to encode the bits
        of color information. The image must be encoded with at least 12 bits per
        pixel.
      Pixelation - Lesson 15 - Color Shades 4x4_instruction: |-
        We start you out with
        the 4x4 image Maddie created in the video. Your task is to fill a 4x4 grid
        with colors using 12-bits per pixel. Here are the requirements: Row 1 - fill
        with shades of red. Row 2 - shades of green. Row 3 - shades of blue. Row 4
        - shades of gray.
      Pixelation - Lesson 15 - Color Shades_instruction: |-
        We start you out with the
        row of shades of red that Maddie created in the video. Experiment with 6-bit
        color by filling in the bottom row of the image with shades of a different
        color. Here is an example with some shades of blue. Try your own color!

      Pixelation Bee_instruction: |-
        This larger image of a bee encodes color with
        12 bits per pixel, but viewing in hex makes it easier to see the color of
        each pixel. If you switch to binary mode - hold on to your hat - it's a lot
        of bits. Here's another mind-blowing thing to try: slide the bits per pixel
        up to 24 bits per pixel. What happens? Can you explain this behavior?
      Pixelation Flappy_instruction: |-
        Here is a bigger image at 9 bits per pixel.
        With 9 bits per pixel you can express 512 different colors. Click through

      Standalone_Artist_1_instruction: |-
        Welcome to Artist! First off, let's try
        to make a simple square using the turn right block and move forward block.
        Each side should be 100 pixels long.
      Standalone_Artist_2_instruction: |-
        Draw this diamond with 120 and 60 degree
        angles and 150 pixel long sides.
      Standalone_Artist_3_instruction: |-
        Can you draw this hexagon with 100 pixel
        sides and 60 degree turns?
      Standalone_Artist_4_instruction: |-
        Now you've got a new block to play with,
        the loop. This will repeat a set of commands. What happens if you loop these
        commands 6 times?
      Standalone_Artist_5.5_instruction: |-
        Notice how we simplified the diamond code
        by turning it into a loop. You can loop that whole sequence 12 times to draw
        the flower. Hint: You'll need to turn 30 degrees after your diamond loop
        so you don't keep drawing over the same diamond.
      Standalone_Artist_5_instruction: |-
        How many times do you need to loop this diamond
        to draw the flower?
      Standalone_Artist_6_instruction: |-
        Loop this hexagon code 6 times to create
        the design. How many degrees will you need to turn each time? Hint: divide
        the number of degrees in a circle by the number of times you are looping.
      Standalone_Artist_7_instruction: |-
        A function is another programming tool to
        help you avoid repeating yourself. This function draws a flower, so you can
        use it any time you want to draw a flower. Use this and the new jump block
        to draw these flowers. Hint: The flowers are 150 pixels apart
      Standalone_Artist_8_instruction: |-
        Here's a function called "Draw a shape"
        that we've programmed to draw hexagons. Run the code to see what it does
        and then experiment with the function to see what happens. Can you make it
        draw a pattern of squares, triangles, or octagons?
      Standalone_Artist_9_instruction: |-
        Now go ahead and make whatever picture you'd
        like! You've even got an empty function that you can make do whatever you
        want!

        Edit the the "patrol" function to

      grade5_playlab_variables11_instruction: |-
        Add another parameter called "speed"
        to the "patrol" function. Try using a "set speed" block with the new "speed"
        parameter to help Penguin get both flags before the other sprites even get
        one.

        This time, when you press 'run',

        Pay attention to how
        this program is written!
      grade5_playlab_variables2_instruction: |-
        The race in that last puzzle wasn't
        very fair! Change the `dog_speed` variable to make sure you can collect more
        flags than Cat. The first to collect 10 flags wins!
      grade5_playlab_variables3_instruction: |-
        Use the left and right arrows to move,
        and the up arrow to jump. See if you can collect all of the flags.
      grade5_playlab_variables4_instruction: |-
        Now we're using a variable called
        "height" to control how high the dog can jump. Update the "height" variable
        so that the dog can jump high enough to reach all the flags.
      grade5_playlab_variables5_instruction: |-
        You've seen now how a variable can
        be used to set the height of an actor's jump. How else could  you use a variable?\r
        \r
        Let's

        Use the right arrow to throw pie.\r

        In
        our game, how should we score points? Add 1 to your "points" variable each
        time Dog hits Cat with a piece of pie. Use the "when actor 2 touches anything"
        event to trigger an update to your score. You can increment your variable
        by setting "points = points + 1." Get your score up to 10 (going one at
        a time!) to pass the level.
      grade5_playlab_variables6ask_instruction: |-
        This time, you need 100 points to
        win!  Don't worry though, you can choose how many points you earn each time
        you score a hit!\r
        Try adding the `ask` block and changing the number 1 out
        for the variable `value`.
      grade5_playlab_variables7_instruction: |-
        Nice, now let's make sure this game
        isn't too easy to play. Any time Dog (actor 1) gets hit by a sandwich from
        Cat (actor 2), you should lose a point. Start with 10 points so it's not
        too hard. Let your score drop down from 10 to 0 to pass the level.
