          description_short: Data
          description: Being able to digitally manipulate data, visualize it, identify
            patterns, trends and possible meanings are important practical skills
            that computer scientists do every day. The data rich world we live in
            also introduces many complex questions related to public policy, law,
            ethics and societal impact. Understanding where data comes from, having
            intuitions about what could be learned or extracted from it, and being
            able to use computational tools to manipulate data and communicate about
            it are the primary skills addressed in the unit.
