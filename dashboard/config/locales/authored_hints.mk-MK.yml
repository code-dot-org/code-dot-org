          of the square...100 pixels!
      2-3 Artist 7_authored_hint:
        2-3_Artist_7_a: The easiest way to solve this puzzle is to draw the first

      2-3 Artist Debugging 10_authored_hint:
        2-3_Artist_Debugging_10_a: Remember, you want the control panel 10 pixels
          *wider*...so be sure to **add** 10 to whatever number you change.
        2-3_Artist_Debugging_10_b: "**Trial and error is perfectly fine here!**  \n\nStart
          by changing one number at a time.   \n\nWhich numbers do what?  \n\nIf you

          before starting to draw!
        2-3_Artist_Debugging_9_b: You don't need to add another block to get the full
          turn, just add 60 degrees to the `turn left` block that's already there!

          between each side.
      2-3 Artist Functions 12_authored_hint:
        2-3_Artist_Functions_12_a: Try running the code first to see what you need

      Course 4 Artist Functions challenge_authored_hint:
        Course_4_Artist_Functions_challenge_a: Part of understanding how to use functions
          is figuring out which ones you need, and which ones you don't.
        Course_4_Artist_Functions_challenge_b: Use a `for loop`, then use its counter
          variable inside of a nested `repeat` loop.
        Course_4_Artist_Functions_challenge_c: Each iteration, you should draw a square
          then jump forward.
        Course_4_Artist_Functions_challenge_d: You will need to turn left by 90 degrees
          outside of your `repeat`, but still inside the `for loop`.
      Course 4 Artist Inspire_authored_hint:
        Course_4_Artist_Inspire_a: After you complete one square, try jumping forward
          half of it's length before turning and making another.
        Course_4_Artist_Inspire_b: Each square and jump is repeated four times (using
          a left turn inbetween) to make a full pinwheel-like unit.
        Course_4_Artist_Inspire_c: Each pinwheel is also repeated four times, with
          a right turn of **360/sides**.

        Course_4_Artist_Vars_13_a: You need two repeat loops (one inside the other)
          both repeating `sides` times.
        Course_4_Artist_Vars_13_b: "The inner repeat loop draws an octagon (turning
          to the left).   \n\nAfterwards, you need to move forward and turn right
          only in the outer loop."
        Course_4_Artist_Vars_13_c: To adjust the shape to stay the same size when
          the number of sides change, use the math block to divide the length in pixels
          by the number of sides.
      Course 4 Artist Vars 6_authored_hint:
        Course_4_Artist_Vars_6_a: To draw a regular polygon, turn **360/sides** each
          time.
      Course 4 Artist Vars 8_authored_hint:
        Course_4_Artist_Vars_8_a: If you divide your starting length by the number
          of sides, the length of each side will get shorter as the number of sides
          gets higher.
      Course 4 Bee Params 7_authored_hint:
        notice_pattern: 'Do you see a pattern in how the number of nectar changes? '
        count_with_for: Notice that the nectar goes up in steps. What kind of block
          can you use to do the same thing many times while counting up?
      Course 4 Bee Params 8_authored_hint:
        Course_4_Bee_Params_8_a: It's okay to ask for a honey number and a nectar
          number each time.  If there's none of something, the number can be 0.
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 2_authored_hint:
        Course_4_Play_Lab_Params_2_a: You will need to click "edit" on the jump function

      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 2_authored_hint:
        Course_4_Play_Lab_Vars_2_a: Make sure to set the number for `dog_speed` to

        Course_4_Playlab_For_Loops_4b_b: How can you make each character reach 330
          pixels in the same number of moves with different starting and stopping
          numbers?
        Course_4_Playlab_For_Loops_4b_c: Remember, it doesn't matter how much a character
          passes the flag by on its last step, as long as it takes each character
          the same number of steps to get to the flag.

          longer than their last, since the counter keeps getting larger.

        Course_4_SCF_2_c: "Before you draw the second row of octagons, you need to
          turn right by 45 degrees and jump forward 96 pixels.  \n\nOnce you're in

          jump backward 408 pixels. "
        Course_4_SCF_2_d: "Notice that because there are fewer octagons in the even
          rows, you don't have to jump back any further to get to the starting place
          for the odd rows.  \n\nThis means you can use the same function for all
          rows."

        Course_4_SCV_1_a: 'Variables are helpful because you can add to them each
          time through a loop. '
        Course_4_SCV_1_b: This puzzle has one loop that creates the polygon, one loop
          that repeats the polygon `sides` times, then another loop that does it all
          again after adding 5 to `sides`.
        Course_4_SCV_1_c: Using a variable for `sides` and one for `length` makes
          the code cleaner because you can loop the same code multiple times, instead
          of creating a new copy for each set of numbers.

        Course_4_SCV_5_b: Each time through the loop, the flowers have two less nectar
          and the bee needs to make one more honey.
        Course_4_SCV_5_c: Notice that at the beginning of the outside loop, the bee
          moves as many times as there is nectar in the next flower.

          an odd number of sides.\n        \nThe `set alpha` block uses division to
          fade the color as the counter gets higher."

          before you make a 60 degree rotation.

        brush_width: We set the brush width to 1, then the color to blue before we
          did anything else.
        double_loop: Try putting a `for loop` inside of a `repeat` loop.
        specifics: "The `for loop` runs from three to seventeen for each of the six
          \"petals\" before moving on to create the next, drawing shapes with only
          an odd number of sides.\n        \nThe `set alpha` block uses division to
          fade the color as the counter gets higher."
        after: When you're done with each "petal", be sure to `move forward` 20 pixels
          before you make a 60 degree rotation.

          Inside the `for loop` you will want to `move forward` then `get nectar` **counter times**.
          After the `for loop` you can just `move backward` **length times**.

          You may need to read this hint several times to understand it. The part in **bold** is a hint about how to use the two `repeat` loops you will need.

        courseD_bee_conditionals5_a: Think of every side of the rectangular path as
          a path by itself. Set up a nested loop with a `repeat` block on the outside
          and a `while there is a path ahead` loop on the inside. How many paths does

        courseD_bee_conditionals5_c: There are 3 sides of the rectangle with flowers,

          to continue along the path, `while there is a path ahead`. To continue down
          the path, the bee will need to `move forward`. While on the path, the bee
          needs to check for a flower. `if there is a flower`, the bee should `get
