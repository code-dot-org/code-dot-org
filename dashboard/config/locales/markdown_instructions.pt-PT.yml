        sign in to test applab levels (By design, applab levels only work if signed

        style='float: right; width: 250px'> A new group of commands has been added
        to the toolbox called **UI Controls** (User Interface Controls) which are
        commands that let you interact with, and respond to, the user of your app.
        To keep it simple, we'll start with just two commands: \r
        * `onEvent` which
        let's you run a function in response to some event occuring (such as a button
        click)\r
        * `button` which puts a button on the screen\r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        You
        will replicate the small app, shown below, which makes the turtle move with
        a button click. You will do three things:\r
        * Add a `button`\r
        * Add an
        `onEvent` block\r
        * Add `moveForward` inside the the onEvent function block\r
        \r
        Here's
        what you should do - you can come back to watch this as many times as you
        need to get it right.\r

      AppLab Intro 1 - Add Button_markdown_instruction: |-
        # Getting Started - Add
        a button\r
        \r
        You'll need a button on your home screen to go to your new
        screen. You can make a new button in two ways. \r
        \r
        1. If you like the
        style of the "Dogs" button you can make a copy of it. Click the button and
        then click "Duplicate".\r
        \r
        \t![](https://images.code.org/171aa97d90014f66f999ecf929b672c0-image-1504289310310.08.10
        AM.png)\r
        \r
        2. You can also make a new button from scratch by dragging
        it in from the Design Toolbox.\r
        \r
        \t![](https://images.code.org/501c9ddd3e5b737df5b9cf053ae198a7-image-1504289359851.09.09

        \r
        3. Click and drag to move your new button where you want it.\r
        \r
        3.
        Once you have a new button give it a clear name, "catButton". You can also
        change its text to read "Cats!".\r
        \r

            \r
        4. There's lots of other ways you can change the look
        of your button. Experiment with the full menu of options.\r
        \r
        5. Once you're
        done run your app to make sure your button appears. Then click "Finish"
        to move on to learn how to make your button actually work.
      AppLab Intro 1 - Add Event_markdown_instruction: |-
        # Getting Started - onEvent\r
        \r
        You're
        back in "Code Mode". You'll notice there's already a bit of code in this
        app. This `onEvent()` block runs some code when the `dogButton` is clicked.
        You're going to need a second `onEvent()` block to make your button work.
        There's two ways to do this.\r
        \r
        1. From Code Mode you can drag in the
        block \r
        \r
        \t![](https://images.code.org/c1ca564880152242c3bf92b2b9ad4fca-image-1504290427563.26.56
        AM.png)\r
            \r
        2. From Design Mode your button has an "Events" tab.
        Click 'Insert and show code' to add the code.\r
        \r
        \t![](https://images.code.org/90d6c0cb723ee4317244f99dcfbd3a66-image-1504290568475.29.18
        AM.png)\r
            \r
        3. Use the drop down to make sure you're making the event
        respond to the "catButton".\r
        \r
        \t![](https://images.code.org/ebef61f18259a2fb0d8addb90d9d8ba4-image-1504290674099.31.03
        AM.png)\r
            \r
        4. The `setScreen()` block changes the screen. Drag this
        block inside your `onEvent()` block and choose your `catScreen` from the list.\r
        \r
        \t![](https://images.code.org/00433d32665ec6f2aa6a0caac2626568-image-1504290788639.33.02

            \r
        5. Run your app. If everything worked correctly your cat
        button should now take you to your cat screen when you click it. When you're
        ready move on to learn how to add sounds to your app!

        # Getting Started - Add Sound\r
        \r
        App
        Lab can play sound too. You'll need to use the `playSound()` block to do
        it.\r
        \r
        1. Drag a `playSound()` block into your `onEvent`. This will make
        the sound play when your user clicks the button. Then click "Choose..."
        from the menu.\r

        You can add sound to your
        app too! Add them outside an `onEvent()` to play from the start of the adventure
        (good for background music) or inside an `onEvent()` to play when that button
        is clicked (good for "Win" / "Lose" sounds).\r
        \r
        1. Drag a `playSound()`
        block into your program\r
        2. Click the dropdown, then "Choose...", then
        "Sound Library" to find the library of sounds built into App Lab\r
        3. Try
        out the "Background" category for longer songs that will play for your entire
        adventure.\r
        4. Hit "Choose" to select the sound you like.\r
        5. You can
        also drag code inside an `onEvent` block to play sound only when an event
        happens. Shorter sounds work better here.\r
        \r
        Run your app. There should
        be sound playing now too!

        more you add to x, the faster the target will go.
      Big Game Animation 3_markdown_instruction: |-
        The `update-danger` function should
        work just like `update-target`, except that the danger should move from the
        right side over towards the left.\r
        \r
        Complete `update-danger` to make
        the danger fly across the screen.
      Big Game Animation 4_markdown_instruction: |-
        At this point in your game your
        danger should run across the screen from right to left, and your target should
        run across from left to right.\r
        \r
        They don't ever come back on screen
        once they've left, but we'll take care of that later.\r
        \r
        Take a minute
        to make sure your game is working like you want it to, and then click "Finish"
        to move on.
      Big Game Booleans 1_markdown_instruction: |-
        When you last worked on your game
        we got our target and danger sprites to fly across the screen, but they never
        come back. Click "Run" to see how your game is currently working, and then
        click finish and we'll work on making those sprites reappear on screen after
        they've left.
      Big Game Booleans 2_markdown_instruction: |-
        Now that your `onscreen?` function
        is checking `safe-left?` and `safe-right?` we need to fix those functions.\r
        \r
        When
        we used them for Sam the Bat we wanted to prevent Sam from leaving the screen,
        but now we want the Target and Danger to actually go all the way off screen
        before returning to the opposite side.\r
        \r
        Go to the "Functions" section
        of the toolbox and complete the `safe-left?` function so that it returns *true*
        if the sprite's x coordinate is greater than -50.\r
        \r
        If you're successful
        you should see the Danger go all the way off the left side before returning
        on the right side.
      Big Game Booleans 3_markdown_instruction: |-
        Now that you've got `safe-left?`
        working, let's fix `safe-right?`\r
        \r
        It should take in a sprite's x coordinate
        and return true if that coordinate is less than 450.\r
        \r
        Once your `safe-right?`
        is complete you should see the Target go off the right side of the screen
        and return on the left.
      Big Game Booleans 4_markdown_instruction: |-
        We've provided a couple of empty
        functions for `safe-left?` and `safe-right?` The first thing you need to do
        is complete the `onscreen?` function so that it checks whether both `safe-left?`
        and `safe-right?` are true.\r
        \r
        **TIP** - even after you add `safe-left?`
        and `safe-right?` your sprites won't return to the screen - why do you think
        that is?
      Big Game Booleans 5_markdown_instruction: |-
        At this point your Danger should
        run across the screen from right to left, your Target should run across from
        left to right, and they should both return to the opposite side, repeatedly.
        Take a minute to make sure your game is working like you want it to, and then
        click "Finish" to move on.
      Big Game Collision 1_markdown_instruction: |-
        At this point you've programmed
        a video game with a moving Target and Danger, both of which return to the
        screen once they've left, and a Player that responds to keyboard input. Click
        "Run" to see how your game is currently working, and then we'll dig into
        the final missing piece - collision detection!
      Big Game Collision 3_markdown_instruction: |-
        Let's fix this `distance` function
        so our collision detection works properly.\r
        \r
        Use the Distance Formula,
        so the distance function returns the distance between the player's center
        coordinates (px, py) and another sprite's center coordinates (cx, cy).\r
        \r
        We've
        provided a working `line-length` function to help you out.
      Big Game Collision 4_markdown_instruction: |-
        The `distance` function returns
        the distance between two sprites.\r
        \r
        Complete the `collide?` function
        so that it returns *true* if the distance between two points is less than
        100 pixels apart.\r
        \r
        If you're successful, your sprites will instantly
        collide - why do you think that is?

        your Target and Danger return to the screen once they've left. Click "Run"
        to see how your game looks right now, and then we'll get to making your Player
        move up and down.
      Big Game Player 2_markdown_instruction: |-
        To move the player up and down, we'll
        need to use a conditional block to figure out which key is pressed and respond
        accordingly.\r
        \r
        Computers read keypresses as numeric key codes - the up
        arrow is **38** and the down arrow is **40**. You can lookup other key codes
        in your student workbook.\r
        \r
        Edit the `update-player` function so the
        player moves up when the up arrow (keycode 38) is pressed, and moves down
        (keycode 40) when the down arrow is pressed.

        # Filtering Images\r
        If
        you've ever used Instragram you've probably encountered an image filter.
        Image filters read in each pixel, process it in some way, and the return the
        filtered pixel. In this tool we're going to start by filtering just a single
        pixel before moving on to a full image.\r
        \r
        You’ll notice there are three
        drop downs under the picture. A red replace, a green replace, and a blue replace.
        Next to it are drop downs for the colors. How many bits are we working with?
        Yes, we’re working with 3. We also learned that the bits control the colors.
        First bit controls R, second bit controls G, third bit controls B.\r

        that you've played with filtering a single color channel, it's time to see
        what happens if we filter more than one color.\r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        \r
        * Using
        the color dropdowns in the filter section, build a filter that changes the
        value of more than one color channel\r
        * Click on the top row of lightbulbs
        in the Diagram section to see how the filter will convert the input (top bulbs)
        to the output (bottom bulbs)\r
        * Look at how the numbers in the Binary section
        reflect changes to the colors\r
        * Complete the Level 4 table in your Activity
        Guide\r

        # Combining Filters\r
        \r
        Sometimes
        you'll need to filter more than one pixel to get the color change that you
        want.\r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        Check out Mario, he's lookin' pretty good in his
        red hat and overalls. Your job it to set up the filter so he looks like Luigi,
        with a green hat and overalls.\r
        \r
        * First, determine which bit(s) needs
        to change in order to the change you want\r
        * Once you've figured out which
        bit needs changing, set the filter dropdown appropriately\r
        * After you've
        got the filter working so that, try to come up with other filters that change
        *only* his hat and overalls - how many different clothing colors can you come
        up with?\r

        # Filtering Images\r
        Now
        that we've seen how a single pixel can be filtered to change its color, let's
        try applying a filter to an image made of multiple pixels. The filter you
        create will be applied to each pixel in the image - and you still have the
        light bulbs available to experiment with how your filter will work with individual
        colors.\r
        \r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        Here's a picture of a red mushroom - you're
        going to try and turn it into a yellow mushroom.\r
        \r
        * First, determine
        which bit needs to change in order to turn red into yellow\r
        * Once you've
        figured out which bit needs changing, use the filter dropdowns to make all
        of the red areas turn yellow\r
        * After you've got the filter working so
        that the red has turned yellow, see if you can come up with filters that turn
        the mushroom other colors\r

        \r
        Bit
        filters can be used to _undo_ filtering as well. Here's an image of a bird
        that's been filtered from it's original colors. Can you get it back to normal?\r

        style="float:right; width: 200px"/>\r
        Here's what our bird should look
        like. Use the filter to get him back to normal.\r
        \r
        * Decide which colors
        (and so which bits) you need to change. You might need to write your thoughts
        with pencil and paper.\r
        * Once you know which bits need changing, set the
        filter dropdown appropriately to test your answer\r
        * After you've fixed
        the image, write down both your process and your final filter in the Level
        6 section of your Activity Guide\r

        # 3 Bit Colors\r
        Each pixel is
        a square on a screen that emits light. Each pixel can have a certain number
        of bits assigned to it, and bits per pixel determine the colors that can be
        rendered.\r
        \r
        In this tool we're using 3 bits to define the one large
        blue pixel pixel. The first bit affects the red tint. The second bit affects
        the green tint. The third bit affects the blue tint.\r

        <summary>**What is whitespace?**</summary>\r
        Whitespace
        refers to any character that shows up as a blank space on the screen, such
        as a space, a tab, or a new line. Whitespace helps separate different parts
        of the document to make it easier to read.  For example, in HTML code new
        elements are usually put on a new line, even though it doesn't make any difference
        in how the page is displayed.\r

        <details>\r
        <summary>**What
        is indentation?**</summary>\r
        Indentation is the placement of text farther
        to the right, or left, to separate it from surrounding text.  Indentation
        helps to convey the program's structure.  In HTML, elements that are inside
        other elements are usually indented.  Here is an example:\r
        <pre>\r
           &lt;body&gt;\r
              &lt;p&gt;This

        <details>\r
        <summary>**What
        is formatting?**</summary>\r
        Formatting is arranging text in a way that makes
        it easier to understand.  HTML is usually formatted using indentation.  That
        means that elements that are inside other elements are further to the right
        in code.  Here is an example:\r
        <pre>\r
           &lt;body&gt;\r
              &lt;p&gt;This
        paragraph is inside the "body" element.&lt;/p&gt;\r

        An HTML element is a piece of a website that is marked
        by a start tag and sometimes closed with an end tag. The element also includes
        the content inside the tags. For example: \r

        So far, you've organized your content

        Headings
        are the different sized section titles throughout a web page. Headings add

        Headings come in 6 different
        sizes. So far you have primarily used the biggest one: &lt;h1&gt;. The number
        '1' in the HTML tag designates that this is the biggest heading. The smallest
        heading is &lt;h6&gt;. You can also try the &lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;, &lt;h4&gt;,
        and &lt;h5&gt; tags, which get smaller as the number gets larger.\r

        <summary>**What
        is HTML?**</summary>\r
        HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is
        used to add structure to the content of a web page. HTML uses tags to specify
        where certain structures start and end. These tags are sets of characters
        not found in the English language so that the content and structure can be

        <summary>**What is an HTML
        element?**</summary>\r
        An HTML element is a piece of a website that is marked
        by a start tag and sometimes closed with an end tag. The element also includes
        the content inside the tags. For example: \r
        <img src="https://images.code.org/fb4df62aa4d879f7021c567be2e28eea-image-1481135855001.png"

        <summary>**What is an
        HTML tag?**</summary>\r
        An HTML tag is the special set of characters that
        tells the machine where the start or end of an HTML element is and what type
        it is.\r
        </details>\r
        </div>\r
        \r
        So far, you've organized your content
        into paragraphs.  Another way HTML allows you to organize your code is by
        using **headings**.  A heading is a short piece of text that goes at the top
        of a section of content, like a title.\r
        \r
        Do This:\r
        * Find the headings
        in the web page below and use the Inspector Tool to see the code that makes
        them.\r
        * Make sure you and your partner agree on what the tags do.\r
        *
        Change the code so that "Drawing" and "2 years" match the headings on

        <summary>**How do I add images?**</summary>\r
        The
        `<img>` tag allows you to show images on your web page. <br><br>\r
        \r
        Example:\r
        <pre>&lt;img
        src="dog.png" alt="dog jumping"/&gt;</pre><br><br>\r
        \r
        In order to
        tell the browser which file to use, extra information, called an **attribute**,
        is added to the &lt;img&gt; tag inside the brackets. The attribute `src` stands
        for **s**ou**rc**e and tell the name of the image. Image files names include
        extensions which tell the computer which type of image they are working with.
        Common extensions are .jpg, .jpeg, .png. <br><br>\r
        \r
        In addition to have
        the src attribute, image elements also have the `alt` attribute which describe
        the image. This is important in case the image doesn’t load or for people
        who have trouble with their eyesight. <br><br>\r
        \r
        An `<img>` tag is an
        example of a  **self-closing tag** because it starts and closes in one tag.
        To mark this we put the `/` which usually goes in the close tag at the end
        of the image tag.\r
        \r
        </details>\r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**Why does an
        image tag not have a closing tag?**</summary>\r
        An image tag doesn't need
        a closing tag because there is no text content which must be wrapped in tags.
        The content that shows on the screen is specified through the tags attributes.\r
        </details>\r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**What
        is an attribute?**</summary>\r
        Attributes are extra information included
        in a tag.  Attributes have names and values. The name tells what type of information
        is being provided and then the value gives the specific information for that
        tag. \r
        \r
        For example &lt;img&gt; tags have two attributes, src and alt.
        src specifies the name of the image file and alt tells the browser in readable
        text what the image is.\r

        The
        `<img>` tag allows you to show images on your web page. <br><br>\r
        \r
        Example:\r
        <pre>&lt;img
        src="dog.png" alt="dog jumping"/&gt;</pre><br><br>\r
        \r
        In order to
        tell the browser which file to use, extra information, called an **attribute**,
        is added to the &lt;img&gt; tag inside the brackets. The attribute `src` stands
        for **s**ou**rc**e and tell the name of the image. Image files names include
        extensions which tell the computer which type of image they are working with.
        Common extensions are .jpg, .jpeg, .png. <br><br>\r
        \r
        In addition to have
        the src attribute, image elements also have the `alt` attribute which describe
        the image. This is important in case the image doesn’t load or for people
        who have trouble with their eyesight. <br><br>\r
        \r
        An `<img>` tag is an
        example of a  **self-closing tag** because it starts and closes in one tag.
        To mark this we put the `/` which usually goes in the close tag at the end
        of the image tag.\r
        \r
        </details>\r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**Why does an
        image tag not have a closing tag?**</summary>\r
        An image tag doesn't need
        a closing tag because there is no text content which must be wrapped in tags.
        The content that shows on the screen is specified through the tags attributes.\r
        </details>\r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**What
        is an attribute?**</summary>\r
        Attributes are extra information included
        in a tag.  Attributes have names and values. The name tells what type of information
        is being provided and then the value gives the specific information for that
        tag. \r
        \r
        For example &lt;img&gt; tags have two attributes, src and alt.
        src specifies the name of the image file and alt tells the browser in readable
        text what the image is.\r

        # The Details Matter\r
        \r
        The
        `src` attribute needs to point to the _exact_ filename of the image you want
        to use. That means you need to pay attention to spelling, capitalization,
        and the file extension. Each of the three images on this page is broken because
        of an improper `src` attribute. Using the file menu for reference, fix each
        of the image tags.\r
        \r
        _Note: Even though the images are not loading properly,
        our website is still showing descriptive text of what should be there because
        we used `alt` attributes. Cool!_

        In addition to have
        the src attribute, image elements also have the `alt` attribute which describe
        the image. This is important in case the image doesn’t load or for people
        who have trouble with their eyesight. <br><br>\r
        \r
        An `<img>` tag is an
        example of a  **self-closing tag** because it starts and closes in one tag.
        To mark this we put the `/` which usually goes in the close tag at the end
        of the image tag.\r
        \r
        </details>\r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**Why does an
        image tag not have a closing tag?**</summary>\r
        An image tag doesn't need
        a closing tag because there is no text content which must be wrapped in tags.
        The content that shows on the screen is specified through the tags attributes.\r
        </details>\r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**What
        is an attribute?**</summary>\r
        Attributes are extra information included
        in a tag.  Attributes have names and values. The name tells what type of information
        is being provided and then the value gives the specific information for that
        tag. \r
        \r
        For example &lt;img&gt; tags have two attributes, src and alt.
        src specifies the name of the image file and alt tells the browser in readable
        text what the image is.\r
        </details>\r
        </div>\r
        \r
        # The Details Matter\r
        \r
        The
        `src` attribute needs to point to the _exact_ filename of the image you want
        to use. That means you need to pay attention to spelling, capitalization,
        and the file extension. Each of the three images on this page is broken because
        of an improper `src` attribute. Using the file menu for reference, fix each
        of the image tags.\r
        \r
        _Note: Even though the images are not loading properly,
        our website is still showing descriptive text of what should be there because
        we used `alt` attributes. Cool!_

        # Adding Your Content\r
        \r
        You
        should now have found a handful of websites that you can use to help make
        your case for the cause you've chosen. If not, keep on researching! Otherwise
        it's time to start structuring the content of your page.\r
        \r
        For all of
        the content you find externally, you'll need to provide attribution to the
        original creator. For now, just include the url of the site where you found
        it in parenthesis. For example\r
        \r
        * According to the ASPCA only 10% of
        animals entering shelters have been spayed or neutered (http://www.aspca.org/animal-homelessness).\r
        *
        Kill shelters euthanize 2.7 million animals per year (http://www.aspca.org/animal-homelessness).\r
        \r
        #
        Do This\r
        \r
        The specifics of your page layout will depend on your topics
        and goals, but in general you should create the following structure\r
        \r
        *
        A first level header with a catchy title for your page\r
        * A second level
        header for each separate argument to support your cause\r
        * Paragraphs of
        content under each second level header\r
        * The urls of any sites where you
        found information\r
        * Don't worry about styling right now you are just getting

        <p>When you mix paint, red and green make
        brown, but RGB color mixing uses light instead of paint, so the colors mix
        differently.  RGB uses _additive color mixing_.  In additive color mixing,
        red and green make yellow, red and blue make magenta, and blue and green make
        cyan.  When you mix the three primary colors together (red, green, and blue),
        they make white.  You can read more at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_color">Wikipedia

        <summary>**What is a style sheet?**</summary>\r
        A
        style sheet is a document that controls how a web page will appear.  External
        style sheets are separate files that are linked to the HTML page.\r
        </details>\r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**What
        is CSS?**</summary>\r
        CSS is a language that controls the way content on
        a web site appears.  It uses rule-sets to change the look of a page.  Each
        rule set has a selector, which specifies which elements on the page will be
        affected, and the rules, which explain how to display the elements.   Each
        rule consists of a property and a value for that property.\r
        \r
        \r
        Here’s
        an example of a rule-set that makes the text in an `h2` tag blue and cursive:\r
        \r
        <pre>h2
        {\r
           color: blue;\r
           font-family: cursive;\r
        </pre>\r
        \r
        In this
        example, `h2` is the selector, `color` and `font-family` are properties, and
        `blue` and `cursive` are the values for those properties.\r
        </details>\r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**How
        do I create a new style sheet?**</summary>\r

        </details>\r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**What
        should I name my style sheet?**</summary>\r
        You can name your style sheet
        anything, but it's better to choose a relevant name, such as "style.css"
        or "aboutmestyles.css" so that it's clear what the file is.  Your file
        should always end in the ".css" extension.\r
        </details>\r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**How
        do I rename a file?**</summary>\r
        To rename a file, you can right click (or
        control click) on the file name and choose the "Rename" option.  This will
        allow you to type in a new file name.  Clicking on a file name after it is

        Copying
        your hyperlinks to all your pages allowed you to get to most of the pages
        on your website from any other page. One hyperlink is missing - the one to
        get you to your home page (index.html).\r

        **Add a hyperlink to your home
        page from all the pages, even your home page itself.** Adding it to your home
        page will keep your navigation header consistent on all pages.

        <summary>**How does the code work?**</summary>\r
        For
        the code to work, you need to both create a winter class and add elements
        to the class.\r
        \r
        The class is created in the style sheet, with the following
        code.\r
        \r
        <pre>.winter {\r
          color: rgb(195,230,255);\r
        }</pre>\r
        \r
        This
        code creates a class called `winter` and makes everything in the class our
        winter blue, which has the RGB values of (195,230,255).\r
        \r
        The code that
        adds a `h5` element to the winter class is `<h5 class="winter">`.  The `class=winter`
        inside the opening tag adds everything inside the tag to the class.\r
        </details>\r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**What
        rules can be added to a class rule-set?**</summary>\r
        A class rule-set can
        have the same rules as any other type of selector.  If a rule does not apply
        to the content of the class (for example, using `font-size` on an element
        with no text), then the computer will ignore that rule, but still use the
        rules that work.\r
        </details>\r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**Why does the selector
        have a period in front of it?**</summary>\r
        In CSS, a period in front of
        a selector means that the selector is the name of a class.  If there is no
        period, it means that the selector is the name of an HTML tag.\r
        </details>\r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**Why
        would a web developer use classes?**</summary>\r
        A web developer uses classes
        when some elements should be styled differently than others, even if they
        are the same tag.  Classes can also be used to give elements that have different
        tags the same style.\r
        </details>\r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**I got different
        RGB values, but mine are right, too.**</summary>\r
        Because RGB creates millions
        of different colors, some are so similar that people have a hard time telling
        them apart.  That means that there are multiple RGB values that are close
        enough to work for our winter color.\r

        <summary>**How does the code work?**</summary>\r
        For
        the code for the winter class to work, it needs to both create a winter class
        and add elements to the class.\r
        \r
        The class is created in the style sheet,
        with the following code.\r
        \r
        <pre>.winter {\r
          color: rgb(195,230,255);\r
        }</pre>\r
        \r
        This
        code creates a class called `winter` and makes everything in the class our
        winter blue, which has the RGB values of (195,230,255).\r
        \r
        The code that
        adds a `h5` element to the winter class is `<h5 class="winter">`.  The `class=winter`
        inside the opening tag adds everything inside the tag to the class.\r
        </details>\r

        <summary>**How
        do I create a new rule-set?**</summary>\r
        You can create a new rule-set by
        following the pattern that the `winter` and `spring` classes used in the style
        sheet.\r
        <pre>.winter {\r
          color: rgb(195,230,255);\r
        }</pre>\r
        \r
        The
        selector name and the color values will be different, but the following pattern
        is always the same.\r
        \r
        <pre>.classname {\r
          property1: value1;\r
          property2:
        value2;\r

        <summary>**Why does the selector
        have a period in front of it?**</summary>\r
        In CSS, a period in front of
        a selector means that the selector is the name of a class.  If there is no
        period, it means that the selector is the name of an HTML tag.\r

        A web developer uses classes
        when some elements should be styled differently than others, even if they
        are the same tag.  Classes can also be used to give elements that have different
        tags the same style.\r

        Whitespace
        refers to any character that shows up as a blank space on the screen, such
        as a space, a tab, or a new line. Whitespace helps separate different parts
        of the document to make it easier to read.  For example, in HTML code new
        elements are usually put on a new line, even though it doesn't make any difference
        in how the page is displayed.\r

        <summary>**What

        Indentation is the placement of text farther
        to the right, or left, to separate it from surrounding text.  Indentation
        helps to convey the program's structure.  In HTML, elements that are inside
        other elements are usually indented.  Here is an example:\r
        <pre>\r
           &lt;body&gt;\r
              &lt;p&gt;This

        means that elements that are inside other elements are further to the right

        <summary>**How
        do I add images?**</summary>\r
        The `<img>` tag allows you to show images
        on your web page. <br><br>\r
        \r
        Example:\r
        <pre>&lt;img src="dog.png"
        alt="dog jumping"/&gt;</pre><br><br>\r
        \r
        In order to tell the browser
        which file to use, extra information, called an **attribute**, is added to
        the &lt;img&gt; tag inside the brackets. The attribute `src` stands for **s**ou**rc**e
        and tell the name of the image. Image files names include extensions which
        tell the computer which type of image they are working with. Common extensions
        are .jpg, .jpeg, .png. <br><br>\r
        \r
        In addition to have the src attribute,
        image elements also have the `alt` attribute which describe the image. This
        is important in case the image doesn’t load or for people who have trouble
        with their eyesight. <br><br>\r
        \r
        An `<img>` tag is an example of a  **void
        element** because it starts and closes in one tag. To mark this we put the
        `/` which usually goes in the close tag at the end of the image tag.\r
        \r

        <details>\r
        <summary>**What
        is a void tag?**</summary>\r
        An `<img>` tag is an example of a  **void element**
        because it starts and closes in one tag. To mark this we put the `/` which
        usually goes in the close tag at the end of the image tag. Void tags do not
        need a closing tag because there is no text content which must be wrapped
        in tags. The content that shows on the screen is specified through the tags
        attributes.\r
        </details>\r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**Why does an image tag
        not have a closing tag?**</summary>\r
        An image tag is a void tag and void
        tags do not need a closing tag because there is no text content which must
        be wrapped in tags. The content that shows on the screen is specified through
        the tags attributes.\r
        </details>\r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**What is an attribute?**</summary>\r
        Attributes
        are extra information included in a tag.  Attributes have names and values.
        The name tells what type of information is being provided and then the value
        gives the specific information for that tag. \r
        \r
        For example &lt;img&gt;
        tags have two attributes, src and alt. src specifies the name of the image
        file and alt tells the browser in readable text what the image is.\r

        <summary>**Why does an image tag
        not have a closing tag?**</summary>\r
        An image tag is a void tag and void
        tags do not need a closing tag because there is no text content which must
        be wrapped in tags. The content that shows on the screen is specified through
        the tags attributes.\r
        </details>\r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**What is an attribute?**</summary>\r
        Attributes
        are extra information included in a tag.  Attributes have names and values.
        The name tells what type of information is being provided and then the value
        gives the specific information for that tag. \r
        \r
        For example &lt;img&gt;
        tags have two attributes, src and alt. src specifies the name of the image
        file and alt tells the browser in readable text what the image is.\r

        The
        recipe page would look a lot better with a picture of the scotcheroos, so
        we added one onto this page.  It might look better somewhere else on the page,
        though.\r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        * Look at the file list on the left of your workspace,
        and find the file named "scotcheroos.jpeg"\r
        * Use the inspector tool to
        find the code that made the image appear on the page.\r
        * Make sure you and
        your partner agree on how the image tag works.\r
        * Try to move the picture
        to the top of the page.

        You can **add hyperlinks to your web
        page using the `<a>` element**.  The text you want to display as the hyperlink
        goes between the opening and closing hyperlink tags. The `<a>` element has
        an attribute `href` which is the location to link to.  The location of a local
        page is just the file path for that page. <br> <br>\r
        \r
        For example to
        link to the unique houses page you would add the following code inside your
        `<body>` element. <br><br>\r

        A web site
        should include more than one web page, and they should connect to each other.   Here's
        an example of a project with multiple pages that are connected by hyperlinks
        (the blue underlined words that take you to another page when you click on
        them).\r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        * Use the inspector tool to see the code that creates
        the hyperlinks on the top of index.html.\r

        There are two types of lists in HTML, ordered and unordered lists.\r

        \r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**What

        An unordered list is just a set of bulleted
        items.\r
        <br /><br />\r
        An unordered list element has the tag `<ul> </ul>`.
        This is an abbreviation for <strong>U</strong>nordered <strong>L</strong>ist.
        Each item in the list is marked by a list item element `<li> </li>`. This
        is an abbreviation for <strong>L</strong>ist <strong>I</strong>tem.  The list
        item element is a child element, which means that it goes inside of its parent

        Making an unordered list has two
        steps: making the list and adding the list items.  To make the unordered list,
        write the unordered list tags `<ul> </ul>`.  Next, add your list items **inside**
        the unordered list tags.  To make each list item, use the list item tags `<li>
        </li>` and write the list item inside the tags.\r
        <br /><br />\r
        It can

        <summary>**What are the two types of lists?**</summary>\r

        There are two types of lists in HTML, ordered and unordered lists.\r
        </details>\r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**What
        is an ordered list?**</summary>\r
        An ordered list is a set of bulleted items
        which are numbered.\r
        <br /><br />\r
        An ordered list element has the tag
        `<ol>` . This is an abbreviation for <strong>O</strong>rdered <strong>L</strong>ist.
        Each item in the list is marked by a list item element `<li>`;. This is an
        abbreviation for <strong>L</strong>ist <strong>I</strong>tem.  The list item
        element is a child element, which means that it goes inside of its parent
        element, the ordered list (`<ol>`).\r
        \r
        </details>\r
        \r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**How
        do I make an ordered list?**</summary>\r
        Making an ordered list has two steps:
        making the list and adding the list items.  To make the ordered list, write
        the ordered list tags `<ol></ol>`.  Next, add your list items **inside** the
        ordered list tags.  To make each list item, use the list item tags `<li></li>`
        and write the list item inside the tags.\r
        <br /><br />\r
        It can be helpful
        to indent your `<li>` tags so it's clear they are contained in the `<ol>`
        tag.\r

        The punctuation, such as the

        to understand the rules in the stylesheet.  The curly braces hold all the
        rules for a particular selector.  Each rule should end in a semicolon, and

        <details>\r
        <summary>**What

        <summary>**What
        is CSS?**</summary>\r
        CSS is a language that controls the way content on
        a web site appears.  It uses rule-sets to change the look of a page.  Each
        rule set has a selector, which specifies which elements on the page will be
        affected, and the rules, which explain how to display the elements.   Each
        rule consists of a property and a value for that property.\r
        \r
        \r
        Here’s
        an example of a rule-set that makes the text in an `h2` tag blue and cursive:\r

           color: blue;\r
           font-family: cursive;\r
        </pre>\r
        \r
        In this
        example, `h2` is the selector, `color` and `font-family` are properties, and
        `blue` and `cursive` are the values for those properties.\r

        To make a new rule set, you'll need
        a selector and a list of rules.  The selector is the name of the tag you want
        the rules to be applied to.  The rules are a list of property and value pairs.  You'll
        also need to pay careful attention to the punctuation in the rule set.  Look
        at the code below for an example of how the code should look.  You'll need
        to change the specifics for your page.\r

        The punctuation, such as the

        to understand the rules in the style sheet.  The curly braces hold all the
        rules for a particular selector.  Each rule should end in a semicolon, and
        the properties and values are always separated by a colon.\r

        to be bigger.\r
        * Add a new rule to your rule-set for your h3 tag to make
        the text bigger or smaller.

        the text inside the `p` tags align to the left side of the paragraph.\r

        * `text-align` is the _property_.  It explains what the rule is about, in
        this case the text alignment.\r
         * `left` is the _value_.  It explains how
        the rule should be applied, in this case making the text align to the left

        Most properties have default

        before you add your style sheet.  The default value for `text-align` is `left`,

        CSS is a language that controls the way content on

        rule set has a selector, which specifies which elements on the page will be

        <summary>**What are the two types of lists?**</summary>\r

        There are two types of lists in HTML, ordered and unordered lists.\r
        </details>\r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**What
        is an unordered list?**</summary>\r
        An unordered list is just a set of bulleted
        items.\r
        <br /><br />An unordered list element has the tag &lt;ul&gt; . This
        is an abbreviation for <strong>U</strong>nordered <strong>L</strong>ist. Each
        item in the list is marked by a list item element &lt;li&gt;. This is an abbreviation
        for <strong>L</strong>ist <strong>I</strong>tem.  The list item element is
        a child element, which means that it goes inside of its parent element, the
        unordered list (&lt;ul&gt;).\r
        </details>\r
        \r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**How
        do I make an unordered list?**</summary>\r
        Making an unordered list has two
        steps: making the list and adding the list items.  To make the unordered list,
        write the unordered list tags `<ul></ul>`.  Next, add your list items **inside**
        the unordered list tags.  To make each list item, use the list item tags `<li></li>`
        and write the list item inside the tags.\r
        <br /><br />\r
        It can be helpful
        to indent your &lt;li&gt; tags so it's clear they are contained in the &lt;ul&gt;
        tag.\r

        <summary>**How
        do I add images?**</summary>\r
        The `<img>` tag allows you to show images
        on your web page. <br><br>\r
        \r
        Example:\r
        <pre>&lt;img src="dog.png"
        alt="dog jumping"/&gt;</pre><br><br>\r
        \r
        In order to tell the browser
        which file to use, extra information, called an **attribute**, is added to
        the &lt;img&gt; tag inside the brackets. The attribute `src` stands for **s**ou**rc**e
        and tell the name of the image. Image files names include extensions which
        tell the computer which type of image they are working with. Common extensions
        are .jpg, .jpeg, .png. <br><br>\r
        \r
        In addition to have the src attribute,
        image elements also have the `alt` attribute which describe the image. This
        is important in case the image doesn’t load or for people who have trouble
        with their eyesight. <br><br>\r
        \r
        An `<img>` tag is an example of a  **void
        element** because it starts and closes in one tag. To mark this we put the
        `/` which usually goes in the close tag at the end of the image tag.\r
        \r
        </details>\r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**What
        is a void tag?**</summary>\r
        An `<img>` tag is an example of a  **void element**
        because it starts and closes in one tag. To mark this we put the `/` which
        usually goes in the close tag at the end of the image tag. Void tags do not
        need a closing tag because there is no text content which must be wrapped
        in tags. The content that shows on the screen is specified through the tags
        attributes.\r
        </details>\r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**Why does an image tag
        not have a closing tag?**</summary>\r
        An image tag is a void tag and void
        tags do not need a closing tag because there is no text content which must
        be wrapped in tags. The content that shows on the screen is specified through
        the tags attributes.\r
        </details>\r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**What is an attribute?**</summary>\r
        Attributes
        are extra information included in a tag.  Attributes have names and values.
        The name tells what type of information is being provided and then the value
        gives the specific information for that tag. \r
        \r
        For example &lt;img&gt;
        tags have two attributes, src and alt. src specifies the name of the image
        file and alt tells the browser in readable text what the image is.\r
        </details>\r
        </div>\r
        \r
        You
        can now add your own images to your personal website.  If you don't have

        # Possible
        Solution #2 - Compound Conditionals\r
        \r
        Another way that you might have
        phrased the challenge problem is:\r
        \r
        \tIf the up arrow was pressed AND
        the sprite hasn't gone off the top of the screen, move up.\r
        \r
        This structure
        of asking both questions at the same time is accomplished using a **compound
        conditional**. Compound conditionals use the boolean operators `AND` and `OR`
        to ask multiple questions at once. `AND` only returns true if _both_ of the
        questions it's asking are true, while `OR` will return true if _either_ of
        its questions are true. In JavaScript (and many other languages) `AND` is
        represented by two ampersands (`&&`) while `OR` is represented by two pipes
        (`||`) - their blocks look like this: \r
        \r

        \r
        We
        could pseudocode this solution as \r
        \r
        \tIf the up arrow was pressed AND
        sprite.y > 0\t// Both Questions\r
            \tmove up\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t // Only

        code from the challenge again, but this time the up arrow uses a compound
        conditional. \r

        # Possible Solution
        #1 - Nested Conditionals\r
        \r
        The way you phrase the previous challenge
        says a lot about how you might approach solving it. For example, you might
        have phrased moving up and staying on screen as:\r
        \r
        \tIf the up arrow
        was pressed then check if the sprite hasn't gone off the top of the screen
        and move up.\r
        \r
        This structure of first asking one question, and then
        asking a second question if the first was true is accomplished using a **nested
        if statement**. Nested if statements put one if statement inside another if
        statement. You can think of this as asking a question and then based on the
        answer asking another question before making a decision. We could pseudocode
        the previous phrase as:\r
        \r
        \tIf the up arrow was pressed\t// First Question\r
            \tIf
        my y > 0\t\t\t\t// Second Question\r
                \tmove up\t\t\t\t// Only runs

        with that color. The nice thing about using `background()` instead of `rect()`
        is that it will fill the screen regardless of how big it is, making your code

        Using the counter pattern with a sprite's
        x and y property makes a sprite move smoothly across the screen. In this program
        **the counter pattern is being used with the `sprite.velocityX` property**
        instead.\r

        \r
        \r
        So far we've looked at a lot of ways to check if a
        single condition is true, but often a program needs to check the state of
        many conditions simultaneously before making a decision. For this challenge,
        let's assume the following scenario:\r
        \r
        - The sprite should move up,
        down, left, and right if the corresponding arrow key is pressed.\r
        - The
        sprite should _not_ go all the way off the screen in any direction.\r
        \r
        #
        Do This Together\r

        # Multiple Paths to
        the Same Outcome\r
        \r
        You may have seen several different approaches to
        solving the previous challenge - one of the beatiful things about programming
        is that it is as much about personal expression as it is about problem solving.
        You could have 10 people attempt to create the same program, and each would
        be unique and reflective of the person who programmed it!\r
        \r
        There are
        two primary approaches to checking for multiple conditions:\r
        \r
        ### Nesting
        Conditionals\r
        \r
        If you think about asking one question first, and then
        asking the second question only if the first was true, you could nest your
        conditionals, like so:\r
        \r
        ```javascript\r
        if (keyDown('up') {\r
          if
        (sprite.y > 0) {\r
            sprite.y = sprite.y - 1;\r
          }\r
        }\r
        ```\r
        \r
        ###
        Compound Booleans\r
        \r
        If you think about asking if both the first and second
        question are true at the same time, you could use `&&` (and) to combine booleans,
        like so:\r
        \r
        ```javascript\r
        if (keyDown('up') && sprite.y < 0) {\r
        \tsprite.y
        = sprite.y - 1;\r
        }\r
        ```\r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        \r
        This program uses a nested
        conditional to check the up arrow and a compound boolean to check the down
        arrow. Use one (or both) techniques to check the left and right arrows as
        well.

        * **Run the program** to see what happens.\r
        \t* The `red`
        value **already counts up by 1**\r
        \t* The `blue` value **doesn't change**
        and so the circle becomes purple, not red.\r
        * Use what you know about counters
        to **add code that will make the circle transition smoothly to red**\r
        *
        **Note:** When the `color` command sees a value outside the range of 0 - 255
        it just rounds. For example, 300 becomes 255 and -100 becomes 0.

        # Expressions\r
        \r
        We're
        going to start learning about **expressions** and how to use them in programs.
        Here are two expressions, a short one and a longer one.\r
        \r
        `1 + 2`\r
        \r
        `(1000
        - 400) / (3 * 20)`\r
        \r
        These expressions have two important components:\r
        \r
        *
        **values:** numbers, text, or information in your program \r
        * **operators:**
        commands telling the computer to perform an action with those value `+`, `-`,
        `*`, `/`\r
        \r
        Don't worry if this is a lot of vocabulary all at once. Try
        using some expressions first to get a feel for how they work.\r
        \r
        # Do

        * **Change some of the
        values and operators in the 4 expressions**. How does it change the rectangle?\r

        # Expressions Evaluate
        to a Single Value\r
        \r
        As you probably just noticed expressions can be used
        in places where you might normally use a number. That's because your computer
        can **evaluate or calculate the single number that is the result of the expression**.
        When your computer runs the command\r
        \r
        `strokeWeight(10 + 20)`\r
        \r
        It
        will first calculate the value of the expression `10 + 20` to be `30` and
        use that value to set the strokeWeight. In fact, **every expression will eventually
        be evaluated to a single value**.\r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        \r
        This program uses
        console.log to show the single value of a couple long expressions.\r
        \r
        *
        **Run the program** to see that the expressions result in a single value\r
        *
        **Create and display the results of some expressions of your own**. It doesn't
        matter what they are, just throw in something long and complex and convince
        yourself a single value always comes out.

        # Random Numbers

        \r
        `10 * randomNumber(1,5)`\r
        \r
        is a perfectly valid
        expression. This is because **`randomNumber` will generate a single random
        value** that can then be used in the expression just like a number.\r

        The animation is working, but
        it's a bit too fast. We're flipping the pages in our virtual flipbook too
        often, so we'll need to slow that down.\r
        \r
        The frequency that our draw
        loop is run is called the **frame rate** - the number of times per second
        the screen is refreshed.\r
        \r
        The default frame rate for Game Lab is 30
        frames per second (or FPS), which is great for a video game, but not so good
        for our animation. We can slow down the frame rate using the `World.frameRate`
        block.\r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        \r
        * Use the `World.frameRate` block at the very
        beginning of your program, setting it to a number (frames per second) that
        slows the animation down a bit. \r
        * Test it out with different numbers to
        see which frame rate you like (the default is 30, and it can't go any higher
        than 60).

        # Doing More With Conditionals\r
        Using
        conditionals to figure out which key was pressed is pretty useful, but we
        can also use conditionals with any value in our program, including sprite
        properties!\r

        With your neighbor, discuss the kinds of boolean questions
        you could use with the following sprite properties:\r
        \r
        - `sprite.x` and
        `sprite.y`\r
        - `sprite.width` and `sprite.height`\r
        - `sprite.shapeColor`\r
        -
        `sprite.visibility`\r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        Here's a program similar to one you
        just made, it uses `keyDown()` to move the sprite around the screen when you
        click the arrow keys. You're going to add some additional conditionals to
        this program to do the following:\r
        \r
        - Change the color of the sprite
        if it goes into the top quarter of the screen\r
        - Rotate the sprite if it
        goes into the left quarter of the screen\r
        - Make the sprite invisible if
        it goes into the bottom quarter of the screen\r
        - Make the sprite larger
        if it goes into the right quarter of the screen\r
        \r

        for the `keyDown()` block, you'll notice that it's now in the 'Game Lab'

        **Dot
        Notation:** Sprites all have the same properties, which is really useful.
        It means that once you know the label of a sprite, you know the labels of
        its properties. All you need to do is combine the name of your sprite and
        the name of your property with a period or "dot" in between. This is also

        the properties `bob.x`, `bob.y`, and so on.\r

        red sprite and a green rectangle that are the same size and have the same
        `x` and `y`. **The sprite does not cover the rectangle since its `x` and `y`

        You could always choose `potato` or `s`, but confusing or unclear names make
        your program hard to read for you and others.\r
        \r
        There are a **few rules**
        when choosing labels:\r
        \r
        * Labels **cannot include spaces**. For example,
        `size of rectangle` would generate an error.\r
        * Labels with multiple words
        can be easier to read in **camelCase**. CamelCase looks like `sizeOfRectangle`
        or `aReallyLongLabelName`\r
        * Labels **cannot begin with a number**. `4sides`
        and `2morrow` will generate errors.\r
        * Be very careful with **spelling**.\r
        *
        Labels are **case-sensitive**. `size` is not the same as `Size` or `SIZE`.\r

        # getSpeed() and getDirection()\r
        \r
        When
        you move around the world, you probably don't normally think about your velocityX
        and velocityY.  You probably just think about how fast you are going in the
        direction you are heading.  You can figure out a sprite's speed and direction
        with math, but it's faster to teach the computer to do those calculations
        for you.  `getSpeed()` and `getDirection()` are methods that use the information
        in `velocityX` and `velocityY` to find your speed and direction.\r
        \r
        #
        Do this\r
        \r
        * For each of the three sprites in this animation: Look at
        its `velocityX` and `velocityY` and guess what its speed and direction are.  \r
        *
        Then run the code and see the answers in the debug console.\r
      CSD U3 abstraction setSpeed_markdown_instruction: |-
        # setSpeedAndDirection()\r
        \r
        Just
        as you can use the `getSpeed` and `getDirection` blocks to see how your sprite
        is moving, you can use the `setSpeedAndDirection` block to tell the computer
        how you want your sprite to move.  This block takes in two numbers, first
        the new speed of your sprite, then the angle of its direction.\r
        \r
        Before,
        you did this by setting your `velocityX` and `velocityY` properties, but `setSpeedAndDirection`
        lets you input the exact speed and direction of your sprite.  The computer
        calculates the matching `velocityX` and `velocityY` values and sets them for
        you, according to code that another programmer already wrote.\r
        \r
        # Do
        this\r
        \r
        Use `setSpeedAndDirection` to make the car stay on the road.  You
        can see the effect on your sprite's `velocityX` and `velocityY` in the debug
        console.\r
        \r
        *Hint: The angle of the road is -20 degrees*\r

        # Side Scroller\r
        \r
        Now
        that you can make your sprite jump, you're ready to start a simple side scroller.  In
        a side scroller game, the main sprite stays at the same x location, and the
        background and obstacles slide past it.  In this first part of the project,
        you'll make a hay bale slide across the screen so that your horse can jump
        over it.  You can do this by creating the hay bale off the right hand side
        of the screen, but setting its velocity so that it moves to the left.  Then,
        when the hay bale is completely off the left hand side of the screen, move
        it back to where it started so it can scroll across the screen again.\r
        \r
        #
        Do this\r
        \r
        * Change the line of code where the hay sprite is created to
        make it start off the right side of the screen. [Show me where](#triggercallout=code_triggered1)\r
        *
        Add a line of code to make the sprite move across the screen toward the left.
        [Show me where](#triggercallout=code_triggered2)\r
        * Add an if statement
        that does the following  [Show me where](#triggercallout=code_triggered3)\r
          *
        Checks whether the sprite has gone off the left side of the screen.\r
          *
        If so, moves the sprite back to its initial position off the right side of
        the screen.\r
        \r
        \r
        _Challenge: Can you make the hay bale come out from
        different places on the right hand side of the screen?_\r

        change animation, or even make a new sprite appear on the screen.  Now it's

        want to use for your sprite, and what you want to happen when they touch each
        other, then code your choice.  You may also choose to change the position,
        speed, and direction of your sprites.\r

        # Collision Types\r
        \r
        There
        are four types of collisions that we use in Game Lab.  These blocks will cause
        a certain type of interaction between the _sprite_ and its _target_.\r
        \r
        ##
        displace\r
        \r
        The `displace` block causes the sprite to push the target
        as long as they are touching each other. The sprite keeps moving normally.\r
        \r
        ##
        collide\r
        \r
        The `collide` block makes the sprite stop when it runs into
        the target.  If the target is moving, it will push the sprite with it.  The
        target keeps moving normally.\r
        \r
        ## bounce\r
        \r
        The `bounce` block makes
        the sprite and the target bounce when they touch each other.  Both the sprite
        and the target change how they are moving.\r
        \r
        ## bounceOff\r
        \r
        The
        `bounceOff` block makes the sprite bounce off the target.  The target keeps
        moving normally.\r

        # Background\r
        \r
        The
        first thing that you will create for your game is the background.   The sample
        game had two different backgrounds that were chosen according to the user's
        score.  The first background has already been created for you.  Look at the
        `background1` function in the code below to see how it works. ([Show me where](#triggercallout=code_triggered1))\r
        \r
        In
        order for the background function to do something, you have to call it inside
        the draw loop. ([Show me where](#triggercallout=code_triggered2))\r
        \r
        There
        is also an empty function named `background2`. ([Show me where](#triggercallout=code_triggered3))  You
        will need to fill that function with new code to make a different background,
        then test the code by calling the function inside the draw loop.\r
        \r
        #
        Do this\r
        \r
        * Read the code for `background1`.\r
        * Fill the `background2`
        function with new code for a second background.\r

        function by calling it inside the draw loop.\r

        Right now, your platform sprite moves down,
        but it doesn't loop back up to the top of the screen. You can look at [Lesson
        15 Level 13](/s/csd3/stage/15/puzzle/13) to see an example of a sprite looping
        around a screen.\r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        \r
        * Use the `function` block to create
        a `loopPlatforms` function at the bottom of your code.\r
        * Use the `if` block
        inside the function to check whether the platform has gone off the bottom
        of screen and, if it has, move it back to the top of the screen.\r
        * Call
        the function inside the draw loop, in the "update sprites" area.\r
        * Run
        the code to test your sprite.\r
        \r
        _Hint: What will platform.y be when the
        sprite moves off the bottom of the screen?  What should platform.y be when
        you put it back at the top of the screen?_

        Making a second platform will be easier than

        the sprite in the new lines.  For example, if you named your original sprite
        "platform", you could name this one "platform2".\r

        You'll also need a scoreboard so the player
        can keep track of the score.   There's already a `showScore` function written,
        but it only shows the text "Score" and not the actual score. ([Show me where](#triggercallout=code_triggered))  You
        can see an example of a working scoreboard in [Lesson 16 Level 9](/s/csd3/stage/16/puzzle/9).\r

        * Call the
        function inside the draw loop, right after you draw the backgrounds.\r
        *
        Use the `text` block to display the score at the top of the screen.

        In

        to create a variable for each piece of information you want to keep track
        of during the game.  Once you have your variables, you can create a function

        you’ve just been using the elements of an array. Now, you're going to change
        what's inside the array.\r
        \r
        Our good friend the piano is back, except
        now it plays notes from two arrays: `notes`, which holds natural notes (C,
        D, E, F, G, A, B), and `sharpNotes`, which holds sharp notes (C#, D#, F#,
        G#, A#).\r
        \r
        # Do this\r
        \r
        The `sharpNotes` array only has one item
        inside of it right now.\r
        \r
        * Fix the array so that the sharp keys on the
        piano can actually play the right note.\r
        \r
        _Hint: Modifying arrays is
        much easier in text mode.  You can always switch between block and text mode
        by clicking the button at the top right of your code workspace._

        built into the Circuit Playground, but when you start wiring your own circuits
        the Maker Toolkit no longer knows where everything is.\r
        \r
        The new **Maker**
        drawer contains general purpose commands instead of ones that are customized
        for the Circuit Playground. In addition to the `pinMode()` and `digitalWrite()`
        commands you've seen, it includes commands to create new objects on the board
        that can be programmed in the same way as the blocks in the **Circuit** drawer.
        The `var myLed = createLed()` command, for example, creates a new LED object

        # Tracking the Score\r
        \r
        Your
        `score` variable should keep track of how many times each user has clicked
        their button. Instead of just going up, `score` should _decrease_ if the player
        1 clicks `buttonL` and _increase_ if player 2 clicks `buttonR`.\r
        \r
        # Do
        This\r
        \r
        Inside each `onBoardEvent`, use the counter pattern to increase
        or decrease `score`. The amount that you change `score` will change how difficult
        the game is to win. Start with changing by 10 - you can always experiment
        with different values when the program is more complete.\r

        Element head is missing a required instance of child element title.\r
        * Element
        title must not be empty.\r
        \r
        Both of these error messages point out that
        **every web page needs a title**. The title is more than just putting a header
        on your page. A computer won't be able to easily go through the content of
        your web page to find your header (it could be in lots of different types
        of tags). So instead **every web page includes a title element marked by a
        &lt;title&gt; tag.** This title does not show up anywhere on your page so
        it is not part of the content of your page.\r
        \r
        Since the title is not
        part of web page content it goes in a special area at the top. This area is
        for all information about your web page that is not content. This information
        is often called **metadata**.  **Metadata goes in the head element marked
        by a &lt;head&gt; tag.**  The title element is a child element of the head
        element so the title element goes inside the head element.\r

        Me page. The project has been loaded with 6 different images. Two pictures

        * Descriptions of your image choices for
        each category inside a paragraph element\r

        \r
        When
        a web browswer is trying to read your document it looks for alerts which tell
        it which language you are using. In order to let the web browser know that
        this is an html document you need to do two things:\r
        \r
        1. Add &lt;!DOCTYPE
        html&gt; at the very top of your html file. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; is always
        the first thing in an html document because it notifies the computer that
        this is an html document and to interpret it as such. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
        is not technically a tag but instead an instruction to the web browser. \r
        \r
        2.
        Wrap all the content of the file in an HTML element using the &lt;html&gt;
        tag. The &lt;html&gt; tag notifies the computer where the html starts and
        ends. The  &lt;html&gt; tag is the container for all other HTML elements (except
        for the &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; tag).  So you need an opening and closing &lt;html&gt;
        tag.\r

        * Add &lt;html&gt;
        right underneath &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; and add a closing &lt;/html&gt; tag
        at the end of index.html

        # Classes\r
        \r
        Sometimes you only
        want to style one specific element of a certain type instead of all elements
        of one type. **Classes are HTML attributes that can be added to any HTML element
        to group it with other elements. Classes allow for the group of elements to
        have their own unique style.** This applies to elements on the same page or
        on separate pages.\r
        \r
        To style using classes:\r
        \r
        1. First you need
        to mark the elements in html that will be in that class.  \r
        2. Second you
        need to write a style rule for that class. To write a rule for a class of
        elements, the selector for the rule is a `.` before the class name. \r
        \r
        For
        example the code below would style the fancy class which has been set up for
        a paragraph element:\r
        \r
        | HTML file | CSS File | Result |\r
        | ---------
        | -------- | ------ |\r
        | <pre> &lt;p class="fancy"&gt;Good Day&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

        There are lots of
        different `<h5>` elements on the page. We want to style them differently depending
        on what season they are associated with.\r
        \r
        * For each season put all
        the `<h5>` elements for that season in a class specific to that season. For
        example all the winter `<h5>` elements would be in the class "winter".\r
        *

        mistakes.  So part of being a good computer scientists is about being able
        to find your mistakes and fix them. In computer science we call mistakes **bugs**.
        Bugs can be anything in code which causes it not to work as planned. The process
        of finding and fixing those bugs is called **debugging**.  Debugging is a
        problem solving process so use your problem solving steps as you try to debug.

        and content. You will be setting up these classes on all the pages of your
        website using divs. The header class contains the title of the website as
        well as the navigation to get around it. The content class contains everything
        else.\r

      CSDU2 - Div_markdown_instruction: |-
        # Div Element\r
        \r
        HTML elements allow
        you to group together content on your web page that is connected. However
        sometimes you want to group together multiple HTML elements into one connected
        chunk and give it a style.  To connect a set of HTML elements inside one element
        you can use the `<div>` element.\r
        \r
        For your Personal Website you are
        going to start out by using this to group together the header section you
        want to go on every page of your website. This will include the title of your
        website as well as any navigation. Once you do this you can put a background
        color on the whole div to make it look like one connected block.\r
        \r
        <pre>\r
        &lt;div&gt;\r

        Now
        that you have your colors and fonts, you can begin to think more about the
        style rules of your brand. This is a simple template page that contains the
        features your website might contain. You will use this page to play around
        with the style rules until you find the right set of style rules for your
        brand. These style rules will be common across all the pages on your website.
        They will promote your own personal brand. Since they will be common across
        all the web pages it would be nice if they could all be written in one place
        instead of duplicating them on every page.\r
        \r
        You can get clearer separation
        of content and style by putting content and style in separate files. The new
        file for CSS will be called an **external style sheet**. Most of the time
        the file name will be **style.css**. Since the file ends in .css the web browswer
        already knows that this is CSS code so we no longer need the `<style>` element
        around it. \r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        \r
        * Add a new CSS file called style.css\r

        Websites
        usually have the same navigation bar across all of their pages so you can
        get back and forth between things on the site. To do this you need to add
        the navigation links to all the pages on your website.\r
        \r
        # Do This\r

        <summary>**What
        are headers?**</summary>\r
        Headers are the different sized section titles
        throughout a web page. Headers add structure to your web page by breaking
        it up so its easier for a user to read.\r
        </details>\r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**How
        do I create a header?**</summary>\r
        You can make something a header element
        by surrounding it by header tags.  For example:\r
        <pre> &lt;h1&gt; Header
        Text &lt;/h1&gt; </pre> <br> <br>\r
        \r
        Notice how there is a the opening
        tag (&lt;h1&gt;) and closing tag (&lt;/h1&gt;). The closing tag is the same
        as the opening tag except it has `/` after the opening angle bracket. The
        text you want to show as the header goes in the middle of the two tags.\r
        </details>\r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**What
        is HTML?**</summary>\r
        Stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is used
        to add structure to the content of a web page. HTML uses tags to specify where
        certain structures start and end. These tags are sets of characters not found
        in the English language so that the content and structure can be differentiated.
        \r
        </details>\r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**What is an HTML element?**</summary>\r
        A
        piece of a website. Marked by a start tag and sometimes closed with an end
        tag. Also includes the content of the element as well. For example: \r
        <img
        src="https://images.code.org/fb4df62aa4d879f7021c567be2e28eea-image-1481135855001.png"
        style="width:500px">\r
        </details>\r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**What is an
        HTML tag?**</summary>\r
        The special set of characters that tells the machine
        where the start or end of an HTML element is and what type it is. HTML tags
        add structure to the content of a web page.\r
        </details>\r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**Why
        do you need an opening and closing tag?**</summary>\r
        You need both an opening
        and closing tag for many HTML elements because it marks where that structure
        starts and stops. You don't want all the text on your web page to be a title.\r

        Headers\r
        \r
        You may have noticed on the last level that everything you
        type into the editor is getting smashed together. In order to differentiate
        between these different parts we use HTML elements to mark the different parts
        of a web page. In your investigation with the inspector did you come across
        something that made headers?\r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        \r
        * Make your header "Animals"
        stand out using the `<h1>` header element.

        <details>\r
        <summary>**What
        is Doctype and how do I use it? **</summary>\r
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; is always
        the first thing in an html document because it notifies the computer that
        this is an html document and to interpret it as such. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
        is not technically a tag but instead an instruction to the web browser. <br>
        <br>\r
        \r
        Add &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; at the very top of your html file.  \r
        </details>\r
        \r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**What
        is the &lt;html&gt; element and how do I use it? **</summary>\r
        \r
        The &lt;html&gt;
        tag notifies the computer where the html starts and ends. The  &lt;html&gt;
        tag is the container for all other HTML elements (The &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
        tag does NOT go inside the html element).  You will need an opening and closing
        &lt;html&gt; tag. This will also make your preview of your website update
        automatically if there are no issues with your code! <br> <br>\r
         \r
        Wrap
        all the content of the file in an HTML element using the &lt;html&gt; tag.\r
        \r
        </details>\r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**Why
        do I need to structure the HTML document this way?**</summary>\r
        Although
        many modern web browsers can make good assumptions about what language you
        are writing in and where to find different information in your document, you
        don't want to leave the display of you web page up to chance. To guarantee
        the best results for displaying your web page on all computers you need to
        assist the computer in figuring out where to find information. <br> <br>\r
        \r
        As
        you go forward you are going to need two different sections in your HTML file.
        They will serve different purposes.\r
        <br><br>\r
        1. Content of the page<br>\r
        2.
        Information about the page<br>\r
        <br>\r
        By breaking up a web page this way
        it is clear where to find the code that is creating the physical output on
        the web page and which code is just information for the computer about the
        page.<br><br>\r
        \r
        In creating web pages we differentiate between these
        two areas using the &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; elements. The &lt;head&gt;
        element contains all the information about the page.  The &lt;body&gt; element
        contains all the content for a web page.\r
        \r
        </details>\r
        \r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**What
        is a head element?**</summary>\r
        The &lt;head&gt; element contains all the
        information about the page. This is extra information that is helpful for
        the computer in displaying your web page but is not the physical content of
        the web page. \r
        \r
        The &lt;head&gt; element usually comes above the body
        element but inside the &lt;html&gt; element. For right now it will be blank
        but later we will learn important things that are added to the head.\r
        </details>\r
        \r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**How
        is the head element different than the header elements? **</summary>\r
        The
        header elements (&lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;) are used to display headers directly
        on your web page for your user to see. The head tag marks the information
        that is not user facing in your HTML document. \r
        </details>\r
        \r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**What
        is the body element? **</summary>\r
        \r
         The &lt;body&gt; element contains
        all the content for a web page.  The HTML elements for your headers, paragraphs,
        and lists should all go inside the &lt;body&gt; element.\r

        # Style Element\r
        \r
        Up until
        now you have only been able to add content to your page. In Web Developers
        intentionally separate content and style to make their code easier to maintain.  HTML
        is the language used to add content to a web page. CSS is a language that
        adds style to a web page. \r
        \r
        In CSS style rules are used to style certain
        elements of HTML.  Style rules explicitly call out certain properties of the
        element to be styled. To add CSS style rules to an HTML page, you need to
        first add an HTML `<style>` element. This signals to the web browser that
        all the stuff inside the `<style>` element is CSS styling instructions. \r
        \r
        \r
        #
        Do This\r
        \r
        * Add the `<style>` element right below the opening `<html>`
        tag. \r

        In the last level
        you moved your style out into an external style sheet. You may have noticed
        though that the style was no longer appearing on the page. To get the style
        to apply to the web page we need to connect the html and css files.\r
        \r
        **To
        link sheets you will need to add a `<link>` element.** The `<link>` element
        goes inside the `<head>` element since it is information about the page and
        not content of the page. You can link a stylesheet to multiple pages if you
        want them all to have the same style.\r
        \r
        `<link>` element has two main
        attributes: `rel` and `href`.\r
        \r
        * As you learned before for images the
        `href` attribute is the file path, in this case just the same of the CSS file.  \r
        *
        The `rel` attribute indicates the relationship that the linked file has to
        the current file, in this case its a stylesheet.\r
        \r
        For example:\r
        <pre>\r
        &lt;head&gt;\r
            &lt;link
        rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;\r

        <summary>**What
        are hyperlinks?**</summary>\r
        Hyperlinks can connect to local web pages or
        external web pages. To add navigation to your website you will need to add
        hyperlinks which connect your individual web pages. You can **add hyperlinks
        to your web page using the `<a>` element**.  The text you want to display
        as the hyperlink goes between the opening and closing hyperlink tags. The
        `<a>` element has an attribute `href` which is the location to link to.  The
        location of a local page is just the file path for that page. <br> <br>\r
        \r
        For
        example to link to the unique houses page you would add the following code
        inside your `<body>` element. <br><br>\r
        \r
        <pre>\r
        &lt;a href=”houses.html”&gt;
        Unique Houses &lt;/a&gt;\r

        <summary>**How
        do I add a hyperlink?**</summary>\r
        You can **add hyperlinks to your web
        page using the `<a>` element**.  The text you want to display as the hyperlink
        goes between the opening and closing hyperlink tags. The `<a>` element has
        an attribute `href` which is the location to link to.  The location of a local

        the &lt;img&gt; tag inside the brackets. The attribute `src` stands for **s**ou**rc**e
        and tell the name of the image. Image files names include extensions which
        tell the computer which type of image they are working with. Common extensions
        are .jpg, .jpeg, .png. <br><br>\r
        \r
        In addition to have the src attribute,
        image elements also have the `alt` attribute which describe the image. This
        is important in case the image doesn’t load or for people who have trouble
        with their eyesight. <br><br>\r
        \r
        An `<img>` tag is an example of a  **void
        element** because it starts and closes in one tag. To mark this we put the
        `/` which usually goes in the close tag at the end of the image tag.\r

        An `<img>` tag is an example of a  **void element**
        because it starts and closes in one tag. To mark this we put the `/` which
        usually goes in the close tag at the end of the image tag. Void tags do not
        need a closing tag because there is no text content which must be wrapped
        in tags. The content that shows on the screen is specified through the tags
        attributes.\r

        <summary>**Why does an image tag
        not have a closing tag?**</summary>\r
        An image tag is a void tag and void
        tags do not need a closing tag because there is no text content which must
        be wrapped in tags. The content that shows on the screen is specified through
        the tags attributes.\r

        <details>\r
        <summary>**What is an attribute?**</summary>\r
        Attributes
        are extra information included in a tag.  Attributes have names and values.
        The name tells what type of information is being provided and then the value
        gives the specific information for that tag. \r
        \r
        For example &lt;img&gt;
        tags have two attributes, src and alt. src specifies the name of the image
        file and alt tells the browser in readable text what the image is.\r

        Since you have
        a logo for your website it would also be cool to have it be small image associated
        your website. The small image associate with your website is called a **favicons**.
        Favicon is short for favorite icon. It displays in the tab for a website,
        when a website is bookmarked, and sometimes in the browsers address bar.\r
        \r
        For
        example when you open a tab for Code.org it might look like this. The icon

        \r
        Favicons are metadata for the website since they are used
        by the web browser and not content on the web page itself. Therefor they are
        included in the `<head>` element. To add the favicon you use the `<link>`
        element. The `href` still is the file path but the `rel` is "shortcut icon".\r
        \r
        For
        Example:\r

        # Do This\r

        # RGB Color\r
        \r
        In order to
        get a nice “fake” notecard color, you will have to break out from the named
        color values given in Web Lab. \r
        Instead, you will be using the RGB function,
        which takes three values, the amount of red, green and blue you want in  your
        color. Each component of the color (red, green, blue) can have a value of
        0 to 255. Where 0 means the component color is not present or dark and 255
        means it is full present or bright.\r
        \r
        For example:\r
        \r
        <pre>\r
        \r
        h1
        {\r
        \tcolor: rgb(120, 0, 255);\r
        }\r
        </pre>\r
        \r

        go to <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_rgb.asp">W3 Schools

        # Priority of CSS Rules\r
        \r
        On
        the last level you moved all the style rules to one style.css file that is
        linked to both web pages on the website. You may have noticed that the way
        some of the styling of the elements on the two pages changed. Over the next
        couple levels you will be working to fix this.\r
        \r
        ## Multiple Rules for
        One Element\r
        \r
        By copying the style rules from two different pages into
        one style sheet we created a couple cases where we have two style rules for
        one element. Style rules are applied from top to bottom so when there are
        multiple style-rules for the same properties of one element the one closer
        to the bottom is the one that will appear.\r
        \r
        For example if you had the
        following style rules.\r
        \r
        <pre>\r
        p{\r
          background-color: blue;\r
        }\r
        p{\r
          background-color:
        red;\r
        }\r
        </pre>\r
        \r
        The pargraph elements would have a red background.\r
        \r
        To
        fix this issue the best thing to do is have one rule for each type of element.\r
        \r
        #
        Do This\r
        \r
        * There are two style rules for `<div>` elements. They are
        both the same. Delete one of them.\r
        * There are two style rules for `<body>`
        elements. They are **different** but both just control the `background-color`
        decide which of the two you would like to keep and get rid of the other one.\r
        *
        Leave the duplicate `<img>` element style rules for now we will deal with
        them on the next level.

        \r
        You
        will need to add two things to your HTML document, Doctype and an html element.

        \r
        When a web browser is trying to read your document
        it looks for alerts which tell it which language you are using. In order to
        let the web browser know that this is an html document you need to tell it
        what type of document it is deal with (Doctype) and where to find the code
        (inside the html element).\r
        \r
        </details>\r
        \r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**What
        is DOCTYPE and how do I use it? **</summary>\r
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; is always
        the first thing in an html document because it notifies the computer that
        this is an html document and to interpret it as such. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
        is not technically a tag but instead an instruction to the web browser. <br>
        <br>\r
        \r
        Add &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; at the very top of your html file.  \r
        </details>\r
        \r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**What
        is the HTML element and how do I use it? **</summary>\r
        \r
        The &lt;html&gt;
        tag notifies the computer where the html starts and ends. The  &lt;html&gt;
        tag is the container for all other HTML elements (The &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
        tag does NOT go inside the html element).  You will need an opening and closing
        &lt;html&gt; tag. This will also make your preview of your website update
        automatically if there are no issues with your code! <br> <br>\r
         \r
        Wrap
        all the content of the file in an HTML element using the &lt;html&gt; tag.\r

        # Personal Website: Search Engine Optimization\r
        \r
        You
        are going to update your website to optimize for finding it on a search engine.
        It is important to know that your website might not be easy to find on a search
        engine.  This might be partially a result of improvements you could make to
        your website. However since your website is hosted by Code.org and does not
        have a descriptive URL it might be harder to find.\r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        \r
        *
        Run your website through the <a href="http://www.seocentro.com/tools/seo/seo-analyzer.html"
        target="_blank"> SEO </a>\r
        * Write down the issues it highlights with
        your website\r
        * We will learn how to fix some of those issues in the next
        couple levels however some may be things you want to investigate on your own
        later such as Social Media presence.

        # Search Engine Optimization: Title\r
        \r
        One
        piece of metadata that should be included in every web page you create is
        the website title. Although you may put an `<h1>` element on your page content
        with the title of your website, the computer does not necessarily know that
        is the title as there may be multiple `<h1>` tags on your page. To make clear
        to the computer what the title is the `<title>` element is added as metadata
        in the `<head>` element. Every page on your website needs it own title.\r
        \r
        Example:\r
        <pre>\r
        &lt;head&gt;\r
        \t&lt;title&gt;
        My Website Title&lt;/title&gt;\r
        &lt;/head&gt;\r
        </pre>\r
        \r
        This `<title>`
        element is not displayed anywhere on the page but the browser may use it to
        put a name in the tab of your web browser or display it when someone searches
        for your website. In fact titles are very important to search engines because
        titles are often a primary piece of information looked at by users to decide
        which websites fulfill their needs.\r
        \r
        *Sometimes search engines will
        still generate their own title for your page based on the user search and
        what the algorithm of the search engine thinks is best for supporting what
        the user is looking for.*\r
        \r
        ## Guidelines for Creating Good Titles\r
        \r
        Since
        titles are so important you will want to make sure you have good titles for
        all the pages of your website. Here are a couple practices for making good
        titles. \r
        \r
        Make your title:\r
        * **Descriptive:** Make sure your title
        explains what someone will find on that page.\r
        * **Concise:** Keep your
        title short. 5 words or less.\r
        * **Individual:** Don't use the same title
        for multiple pages.\r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        \r
        * Add a `<title>` element to each
        web page on your website
      CSDU2 - SEO 3_markdown_instruction: |-
        # Search Engine Optimization: Description\r
        \r
        Another
        important piece of meta data used by search engines is the description. The
        description is added using the `<meta>` element. It has two attributes, the
        name and the content. The content is where the actual description goes. **Every
        page should have its own description.**\r
        \r
        <pre>\r
        &lt;head&gt; \r
        \t&lt;meta
        name="description" content="Your meta description goes here " /&gt;\r
        &lt;/head&gt;\r
        </pre>\r
        \r
        Just
        like the title tag this will not show up physically on the page but will be
        used by search engines to display information about your page. Sometimes the
        description will also be used when you share the link on social media platforms.
        \r
        \r
        *Just like titles the search engine might decide it knows best and
        generate a description for the page that is different than the one you provided.*\r
        \r
        ##
        What goes in a description?\r
        \r
        A good description will follow these guidelines:\r
        \r
        *
        **Descriptive:** Unique description of what someone will find on this page\r
        *
        **Keywords:** Uses keywords in full sentence descriptions which someone might
        use to search for your page\r
        * **Short:** Less than 150 characters\r
        *
        **Avoid Special Characters:** Don't use special characters such as ‘”<>{}[]()\r
        *
        **Enticing:** It makes someone want to look at your web page.\r
        \r
        # Do
        This\r
        \r
        * Add descriptions to each web page on your website using the
        `<meta>` tag \r
        * Test it out!\r
        \t* Open <a href="http://www.seocentro.com/tools/seo/seo-analyzer.html"
        target="_blank"> SEO </a>\r
            * Re-load the results for your page to
        use the most updated version\r
            * Under the <img src="https://images.code.org/01e0d19ff0278ba750efc3b3824b31b0-image-1477075078800.37.19
        PM.png" style="width:80px"> section there is a preview of the Google Search
        results.\r
            \r
        *Remember that the search engine might still decide to
        use something else as your description. It is not a big deal and it is still
        important to have a description.*

        the width of the device you can use the `<meta>` element with the attributes
        below. The `<meta>` element should go inside the `<head>` element with all
        the other meta data.\r

      CSDU2 - Selector and Property_markdown_instruction: |-
        # CSS Style Rules\r
        \r
        Style
        rules consists of two main parts: the selector and the property. All style
        rules go inside the `<style>` element.\r
        \r
        # Selector\r
        The selectors
        can be any part of the web page you want to style. One way you can identify
        parts of the web page is using the names of the element. Selecting an element
        will make all elements of that type have the given styling. The selector name
        for HTML elements is the name of the tag with the brackets removed. In the
        below example the selector is `h1` and it will style all the h1 tags with
        the properties inside the `{ }`.\r
        \r
        # Property\r
        The property describes
        which style component of the selected element to change. There are lots of
        different style properties you can change about your web page. Not all properties
        can be used for all elements.\r
        \r
        The first property we will use is the
        `color` property. The **`color` property sets the color of text** and works
        for any text elements including paragraphs, lists and headers. There are tons
        of colors you can choose. Luckily Web Lab pops up a list as you type. You
        can also look at the full list of colors at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp">W3
        Schools - CSS Colors</a>.\r
        \r
        Example:\r
        \r
        The below style will make
        all the h1 headers on the page have blue text.\r
        \r
        <pre>\r
          &lt;style&gt;\r
            h1{\r
              color:blue;\r
            }\r
          &lt;/style&gt;\r
        </pre>\r
        \r
        #
        Do This\r
        \r
        * Add a style rule for h1 headers so the text is green.\r
        *
        Add another rule that defines the color of h3 headers. Pick any color you
        would like.
      CSDU2 - Separate Content and Style_markdown_instruction: |-
        # Separate Content
        and Style\r
        \r
        Soon you will get to apply your new brand style rules to
        your website. Before you do that, though, let's investigate how to style
        a multi-page website.\r
        \r
        As already mentioned, from this point forward
        we will be using external style sheets instead of styling inside the HTML
        file because this keeps all the styling for the website in one place.  However,
        in order to do this you are going to have to pay extra close attention as
        you remove your old styling. Even though you want consistent style on your
        website, you will have exceptions to the style rules in certain cases. Exceptions
        to the style rules might include the note card styling, which you worked on
        in the last lesson. We would not want every list to have the note card styling,
        just those specific ones on the recipe page.\r
        \r
        You will never want to
        have duplicate rules for the same selector. So there should not be two stylings
        with `p` as the selector. Instead you need to leverage the ability to make
        classes in order to have multiple styles for `<p>` elements. \r
        \r
        To practice
        this, we have a website with an external style sheet that also still has styling.
        You will need to figure out how to keep the unique elements of the individual
        web pages while getting a more consistent style across the pages.\r
        \r
        Unique
        Elements You Want to Keep:\r
        \r
        \t1.\tThe styling of the `<img>` elements
        on one page should be different than the other\r
        \t2.\tFor the `<h1>` headers,
        on one page we want to style them and on the other we don't.\r
        ￼\r
        # Do
        This\r
        \r
        * Put the image on the home page in the "home-image" class\r
        *
        Find the old style rule for images on the home page (width: 600px) and change
        the selector so it will style the "home-image" class instead\r
        * Put all
        the images on the technology page in the "tech-images" class\r
        * Find the
        old style rule for images on the technology page (width: 100px) and change
        the selector so it will style the "tech-images" class instead\r
        * Find
        the h1 element on the technology page and put it in the class "page-header"\r
        *
        Change the secltor for the style rule for h1 elements to be just a style rule
        for the page-header class\r
        * Copy the three new style rules you created
        into your style.css file.\r
        * Delete the `<style>` element and its contents
        from both pages.

        Once files are in a folder you need to help the
        computer find them by giving both the folder name and the file name.  For
        example to display the dog.png file in the folder called images we would use:\r
        \r
        <pre>
        &lt;img src="images/dog.png" alt="dog jumping" /&gt; </pre>\r
        \r
        The
        folder names comes first follow by the image name. We separate them with a
        / .\r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        * Add a folder called pictures\r
        * Move all the image
        files into the pictures folder\r
        * Notice how all the pictures no longer
        show but the text in the alt attribute does.\r
        * Update the links to the
        images so they display again

        Now that you have the basic layout for your Recipe
        page you need two lists. An ingredients list and a directions list. Start
        by trying to create the ingredients list. All text on your web page should
        go inside one type of HTML element (header, list, or paragraph).\r
        \r
        #

        Under your ingredients header create an unordered list of ingredients.

        # Font Properties\r
        The way
        text looks is called a font. Two properties that control font are `font-family`
        and `font-size`.\r
        \r
        ## font-family\r
        There are 5 fonts that will look
        the same across any browser:\r
        \r
        * serif\r
        * sans-serif\r
        * monospace\r
        *
        cursive\r
        * fantasy\r
        \r
        We will focus on using those font families to
        start. To read more about font families you can go to <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_font_font-family.asp">
        W3 Schools - CSS font-family</a>\r
        \r
        ## font-size\r
        There are many values
        that can be used to determine font-size. Pixels are the easiest to use. A
        pixel is one tiny square on the screen. So when a font is 14px that means
        its 14 pixels tall.\r

        \r
        # Do This\r
        \r
        * Add a font-family property
        to h1 style to make the font cursive\r

        elements larger.

        <summary>**Why
        do I need to structure the HTML document this way?**</summary>\r
        Although
        many modern web browsers can make good assumptions about what language you
        are writing in and where to find different information in your document, you
        don't want to leave the display of you web page up to chance. To guarantee
        the best results for displaying your web page on all computers you need to
        assist the computer in figuring out where to find information. <br> <br>\r
        \r
        As
        you go forward you are going to need two different sections in your HTML file.
        They will serve different purposes.\r
        <br><br>\r
        1. Content of the page<br>\r
        2.
        Information about the page<br>\r
        <br>\r
        By breaking up a web page this way
        it is clear where to find the code that is creating the physical output on
        the web page and which code is just information for the computer about the
        page.<br><br>\r
        \r
        In creating web pages we differentiate between these
        two areas using the &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; elements. The &lt;head&gt;
        element contains all the information about the page.  The &lt;body&gt; element
        contains all the content for a web page.\r
        \r
        </details>\r
        \r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**What
        is a head element?**</summary>\r
        The &lt;head&gt; element contains all the
        information about the page. This is extra information that is helpful for
        the computer in displaying your web page but is not the physical content of
        the web page. \r
        \r
        The &lt;head&gt; element usually comes above the body
        element but inside the &lt;html&gt; element. For right now it will be blank
        but later we will learn important things that are added to the head.\r

        header elements (&lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;) are used to display headers directly
        on your web page for your user to see. The head tag marks the information

        Format your HTML document with two sections using the
        &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; elements as shown in the image below. From this
        point forward anything you add to an HTML document should go inside either
        the &lt;head&gt; or the &lt;body&gt; elements. Put all the content and structure
        you have created so far inside the &lt;body&gt; element.\r

        # Head and Body\r
        \r
        There are now
        two different sections of code in our HTML file:\r
        \r
        1. Content of the
        page\r
        2. Information about the page (for right now just how to style it).\r
        \r
        In
        creating web pages we differentiate between these two areas using the &lt;head&gt;
        and &lt;body&gt; elements. These elements are important for creating maintainable
        code but will also be useful for other things as well. The &lt;head&gt; element
        contains all the information about the page, also sometimes called **metadata**.  The
        &lt;body&gt; element contains all the content for a web page.\r
        \r
        Outline
        of the structure of your web page:\r
        \r
        <pre>\r
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\r
        &lt;html&gt;\r

        # Image Properties\r
        \r
        Images
        elements also have properties that can change their style.\r
        \r
        ## Size\r
        One
        of the image properties is size. You can control size of an image using the
        `width` and `height` properties. The size is determined by the number of pixels
        tall and wide an image is. Pixels is abbreviated to `px`.  For example to
        make all the images 100 pixels wide you would use:\r
        \r
        <pre>\r
        img {\r
        \twidth:
        100px;\r
        }\r
        </pre>\r
        \r
        Although you can control both width and height
        it is best practice to only set either width and height since setting both
        can distort the image.\r
        \r
        \r
        \r
        ## Borders\r
        Borders are a common property
        for many elements including images. Borders consist of three properties: `border-style`,
        `border-width` and `border-color`.\r
        \r
        <pre>\r
        img {\r
              border-style:
        dashed;\r
              border-width: 5px;\r
              border-color: blue;\r
        }\r
        </pre>\r
        \r
        For
        more information about borders go to <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_border.asp">
        W3 Schools - Border Properties</a>.\r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        \r
        * Add a rule to
        style img elements\r
        * Use the rule to set the width of all images to 200
        pixels\r
        * Add borders to all images. Be creative and try different border
        styles and colors.

        # Title Element\r
        \r
        One
        piece of metadata that should be included in every web page you create is
        the website title. Although you may put an `<h1>` element on your page content
        with the title of your website, the computer does not necessarily know that
        is the title as there may be multiple `<h1>` tags on your page.\r

        make clear what the title of a website is for the computer the `<title>` element
        is added as metadata in the `<head>` element.  This title is not displayed
        on the page anywhere as a result of the title tag but the browser may use
        it to put a name in the tab of your web browser or when someone searches for

        # Cause Page\r
        \r
        Let's start
        by setting up the page you will be using to create your cause page.\r
        \r
        #
        Do This\r
        \r
        * Add a new HTML file to your project for your cause page.\r

        # Adding Your Content\r
        \r
        You
        should now have found a handful of websites that you can use to help make
        your case for the cause you've chosen. If not, keep on researching! Otherwise
        it's time to start structuring the content of your page.\r
        \r
        ## Hyperlinks
        to Websites\r
        \r
        Earlier in the unit you learned how to use the `<a>` element
        to link between pages on your website. You can also use this element to link
        to other websites. To do this the `href` attribute needs to contain the full
        URL of the site you wish to link to. For example if I wanted to link to the
        Code.org website in my project I would use the following code:\r
        \r
        | Code
        | Output|\r
        | ---- | ----- |\r
        | <pre> My favorite coding site is &lt;a
        href="https://code.org/" &gt; Code.org &lt;/a &gt; ! </pre> | My favorite
        coding site is <a href="https://code.org/"> Code.org </a> ! |\r
        \r
        # Do
        This\r
        \r
        The specifics of your page layout will depend on your topics and
        goals, but in general you should create the following structure\r
        \r
        * A
        first level header with a catchy title for your page\r
        * A second level header
        for each separate argument to support your cause\r
        * Paragraphs of content
        under each second level header\r
        * A link to the appropriate site where you
        need to cite outside sources\r
        * Don't worry about styling right now you
        are just getting the content\r
        \r
        Attribution links can take many forms,
        for example\r
        \r
        * According to the [ASPCA](http://www.aspca.org/animal-homelessness)
        only 10% of animals entering shelters have been spayed or neutered.\r
        * Kill
        shelters euthanize 2.7 million animals per year (Source: [ASPCA](http://www.aspca.org/animal-homelessness)).

        small so that the combination is memorable. A set of 4 main colors or less

        # Pick Your Fonts\r
        \r
        Part
        of any good brand is having a specific font that is associated with the brand.
        Most brands keep to a small set of fonts they use. These fonts however are
        unique to the brand and will need to adventure beyond the 5 font families
        you have been using.\r
        \r
        Picking a small set of fonts for your website
        is also a good practice as when you adventure beyond the 5 font families into
        other fonts the browser has to download the font file. Downloading files is
        something that can add time to how long it takes to your load your website.
        To prevent it from taking too long it is good to stay with just 2 different
        fonts.\r
        \r
        # Do This\r

        # Documentation\r
        As we move forward
        you are going to see more and more (and more!) commands added to the toolbox.  What
        happens if you see a command and don't understand it, or you forget how it
        works?  Don't worry, this happens to professional programmers all the time!
        No one actually memorizes long lists of commands.  Most programming environments
        have ways to quickly look up documentation about the commands of the language
        you're using.  **Good news: App Lab has documentation too!**\r

        \r
        When
        you **hover your mouse over a command** in the block palette a bubble pops
        up with a quick reminder of what a function does, and what its parameters
        are. If you click "See examples", you will be taken to more detailed documentation
        of the command which includes **code examples** that you can even copy and

        The `promptNum` command appears in
        the variables toolbox because it's typically used as a way to get a value
        from the user that you want to hold on to while the program runs.\r
        \r
        `promptNum`
        is similar to `randomNumber` in that it is a function whose return value *evaluates
        to a number*. The difference here is that `promptNum` pops up an input dialog
        box and waits for the user to type a number.  Once they do and hit "OK"
        the number they typed is returned and we can store it in a variable to use
        in our programs.

        # Debug Console: Variable Values\r
        \r
        Up
        until now, if we wanted to find out the value of a variable at some point
        in the execution of a program, we've used `console.log`. That is still going
        to be a great strategy but **the Debug Console can do even more for us!**\r
        \r
        **Check
        this out:** We can check the value of a variable in real time (as our program
        executes) by typing its name into the prompt within the Debug Console and
        hitting "enter". **This is another powerful tool for debugging your programs.**

        \r
        Check out the new **Debug
        Commands toolbox** that has appeared next to the Debug Console! These powerful
        tools allow us to **pause a program at a certain point** while it’s running
        and then execute lines one at a time. \r
        \r
        Using these tools we can investigate
        the state of variables and other elements of the program at any point, mid-execution.
        This makes it much easier to see what’s happening while the programming is
        actually running!\r
        \r
        In order to use the debug commands, you first have
        to indicate which line you want the program to pause at.  This is called adding
        a “breakpoint” (see animation below).\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        * **Add a breakpoint**

        # New Elements and Events:
        Moving Buttons with Events\r
        \r
        Over the next few exerises we will be exploring
        several new user interface elements and event types. Your code will be pulled
        forward as you progress through the exercises.\r
        \r
        **Moving Past Turtle:**
        We've been using buttons to move the turtle. For example, in the program
        you're about to see a button that moves the turtle to a random location on
        the screen. We're going to alter this program ** so that the button itself
        moves every time you click it**.\r
        \r
        **Notice** that this means that event
        handlers can affect the elements they are attached to, not just other elements!  This
        is an interesting technique for apps.  Now you're going to try it...\r
        \r
        #
        Do This:\r
        * **Change the ID** of the button to something descriptive and
        meaningful.\r
        * **Modify** your event handler so that **it no longer moves
        the turtle** but instead sets the position of the button itself to a random
        location on the screen.\r
        \t* TIP: add `setPosition` to the event handler,
        and just move the `randomNumber` calls from the turtle.\r
        \t* Recall the
        screen is **320 by 450 pixels**.\r

        and change your event handler to use it.\r
        * **Note:** There are some events
        that capture keystroke events. These are interesting, but they do not work
        easily with buttons.  We'll stick to mouse events for now, and get to keys
        later.

        # Activate Your Button\r
        In
        the last lesson you focused on laying out a page of your app in Design Mode.
        This is a great, quick way to get the visual side of an app figured out, but
        it's not very functional. If you click any of the buttons you added, nothing
        happens. Now you're work towards adding some basic functionality by making
        the buttons in your app actually _do_ something!\r
        \r
        **Goal:** Add code
        using Design Mode to make the button respond to a click.\r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        Your
        starter app has two elements, a _label_ with the id `titleLabel` and a _button_
        with the id `changeTitleButton`. To start with, you're going to make the
        button log a message to the console when it's clicked.\r
        \r
        * In Design
        Mode, **click on the provided button to edit its properties**\r
        * Click on
        the **Events** tab\r
        * Insert an `onEvent` from Design Mode by clicking **Insert
        and show code** under the **Events Tab**.\r
        * Take a look at the block that
        was added to the **Code Mode** tab.\r
        * Run the program, click your button
        and **look for the output in the *Debug Console* **below the workspace instead
        of the app window. We will discuss the *Debug Console* on the next level.

        # Updating IDs and Debugging
        with Console Log\r
        \r
        Here we have a couple buttons with event handlers
        and `console.log` statements, but they are all switched around!\r
        \r
        We
        should have given the buttons better ID names so we could tell the difference
        based on the ID. **Can you update the ID names and `console.log` messages
        to match the correct button? **\r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        \r
        * **Change the IDs**
        of the buttons in Design Mode to more descriptive names.\r
        \r
        * Switch to
        Code Mode and notice that the **ID pulldowns have been updated to include
        the new IDs**. (You still need to select the correct ID from the pulldown
        menu.)\r
        \r
        * **Update the `console.log` messages** to match the buttons.\r

      CSDU4 - Design Mode - 2_markdown_instruction: "# Buttons and Unique IDs\\r\nYou\nmay
        have noticed that the button command has two parameters: `button(id, text)`.
        \ The\n`text` is the text that actually shows up on the button display, and
        the `id`\n(we'll typically write **ID**) is a **unique identifier** for that
        element\nin the app.\\r\n\\r\nEach element that appears in the app must have
        a **unique\nID**. In fact, if you try to run a program that has two buttons
        with same\nID you will get a warning message in the console. Watch:\\r\n<img

        solid 1px black; width:500px\">\\r\n\\r\nNotice that even though\nthe text
        on the buttons was different, the IDs were the same, which caused\nthe error
        message to show up. To get rid of that error message you will have\nto change
        the ID of the button from the default `id` to something else.\\r\n\\r\n**Error\nmessages
        happen to everyone and they are helpful!**: getting an error or warning\nmessage
        when you run your program is *not a big deal*. Programmers actually\nrely
        on error messages to tell them where and how to fix their code.\\r\nSometimes\nerror
        messages are bit cryptic: `WARNING: Line: 2: button() id parameter refers\nto
        an id (id) which already exists.` But a warning like this contains helpful\ninformation
        and clues such as the line the error occured on, or some word\nor command
        it didn't recognize. "

        # Changing Elements on Screen
        \r
        \r
        There's another way to display text in your app besides `console.log`
        and `write`.  \r
        \r
        There is a command called `setText` which will **change
        the text of a component on screen** given its id. This is a very powerful
        technique and one that you will use a lot. Here's what it looks like in action....\r

        \r
        As
        we saw a user can now type inside of a text input whenever they want, **but
        now we'll need a way to access that text**. In order to do that you'll need
        to use the `getText` command, which you can now find in the **UI Controls**
        tab.\r

        You can use a `getText` command just
        like a string within a `console.log` or `write` command. Just like with `setText`
        you will refer to the UI element by its ID.\r

        is clicked.\r

        Often
        we want to save the information we pull in from the user for later use in
        our program. The best way to do this is to save it in a variable.\r
        \r
        #
        Do This:\r
        \r
        * **Create two variables inside your event handler** to store
        the **age** and **name** of the user.\r
        * **Use `getText()` to update the
        values** stored in each of these variables.\r
        * **Change your `console.log`
        statements to use your variable instead of `getText`**.\r

        # Generating Text Output\r
        \r
        So
        far we've been outputting our messages to the console, but now we'd like
        to display them in the app. In order to do so we're going to be using a new
        UI element called a **textArea**. You can use `setText()` with a **textArea**
        just like you would with a **textLabel**.\r
        \r

        PM.png)\r
        \r
        If we want to combine user input with default text we can do
        so with **string concatenation** (that's just a fancy phrase for combining
        strings of text). Together with a **textArea** we can use this ability to
        compose longer messages based on user input.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        * **Add
        a textArea** to your app and give it a descriptive and meaningful ID.\r
        *
        **Create a variable inside your event handler** called `userMessage` to hold
        the full message that will be sent to the user.\r
        * **Use string concatenation**
        to compose a message from the user input.\r
        \t* eg `var userMessage = "Welcome
        " + userName + "!";`\r
        * **Use `setText()`** to place your `userMessage`
        inside the `textArea` you created.\r

        # How Do Events Work?\r
        Event-driven
        apps are made up of elements that can trigger events (such as buttons) and
        pieces of code called **event handlers**. Event handlers are commands that
        "watch" for certain events to occur in your program, and then run some function
        when an event occurs.\r
        \r
        When you first create an event handler from Design
        Mode, puts a `console.log()` block inside to help you test the event, but
        you can put just about any code you want inside the event hander.\r
        \r
        #
        Do This\r
        \r
        The toolbox has a new block called `setText` which allows you
        to change the text of an element on the screen. You're going to modify the
        button event handler so that it changes the title text when clicked.\r
        \r
        *
        Drag out a `setText()` block to the _inside_ of the `onEvent()` callback function
        (where the `console.log()` block currently is)\r
        * From the block's dropdown,
        select "titleLabel" (the id of the element you want to change)\r
        * In the
        block's second input, replace "text" with a new title for the app\r
        *
        Run your program and click the button to see it work

        # *keypress*\r
        \r
        If we want
        to add keyboard input to our apps we'll need to learn about how key events
        work in App Lab. To start let's take a closer look at the `onEvent` block.
        We already know that event handlers call a function. What we'll see now is
        that they also **pass a parameter**. The default name for this parameter is
        simply `event` but you can change it to be anything you like. \r
        \r
        The
        `event` parameter is a more complex kind of variable (called an "Object")
        that we'll learn more about later. For now just know that for both mouse
        and keyboard events, the event parameter passes more information about the
        event. In the case of key events **you can find out the key(s) that were actually
        pressed by using `event.key`**.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        * Drag out an `onEvent`
        block.\r
        * Change the ID to `screen1` and the event type to `keypress`.  \r
        \r
        <img

        style="width: 450px">\r
        \r
        * Once you hit **Run**, **click on the screen
        so that the keystrokes will register**.\r
        * **Type different combinations
        of keys** and check out the results in the console. Does every key combination
        print to the console? Some keys to try:\r
            * Letter keys\r
            * Number
        keys\r

        You are going to get the chance to play
        with `keyup` and `keydown` in this level. **Pay attention to the different
        values of `event.key` for `keydown` and `keypress`. **\r
        \r

        # Play Sound With Keys\r
        \r
        You
        may have noticed from the last couple of levels that the value of `event.key`
        is just a string which is the name of the key. As a result we can check which
        key was pressed with a simple conditional statement.  For example to check
        for the press of the **"a"** key we could write `if (event.key == "a")`.\r
        \r
        #
        Do This:\r
        The **starter code provided** plays the sound whenever ANY key
        is pressed.\r
        \r
        * Use `console.log` to **find out the value of `event.key`
        when the up arrow is pressed.**\r
        \r
        * **Add an `if` statement** so the
        sound only plays when the when the **up arrow** is pressed.

        # IDs\r
        The `id` (we'll typically
        write **ID**) is a **unique identifier** used for each element in the app.\r
        \r
        Each
        element that appears in the app must have a **unique ID**. In fact, if you
        try to run a program that has two buttons with same ID you will get a warning
        message in the console.\r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        While each element you drag out
        in Design Mode gets a default ID, they aren't really that helpful (like `button1`
        and `button2`), so you should get in the habit of creating your own IDs.\r
        \r
        *
        Change the ID of your "click me" button to something useful (like `redButton`)\r
        *
        Drag out a second button\r
        * Make the second button blue and give it an ID
        of `blueButton`

        **Debugging:** As you write more complex event-driven programs,

        and correcting errors within a program. It is a critical (and generally unavoidable)
        step when writing code.<img src="https://images.code.org/b5d00d8027dae463eebb7f1c079cb2e2-image-1444156708725.gif"

        # Moving and Sizing Buttons\r
        \r
        An
        important component of designing intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces
        is the location of the elements on the screen. Using the `setPosition` command
        (now added to the Toolbox) you can move and set the size of user interface
        elements.\r
        \r
        ![](https://images.code.org/c3e42223cbcb096f992d758973d09f63-image-1444664597665.42.48
        AM.png)\r
        \r
        **NOTE:**\r
         * If you only want to set the size you can use
        the `setSize` function which looks like this:\r

        \r

        * If you *only* want to set the position *without* changing the size of the
        element, you can omit the *width* and *height* parameters from the `setPosition`
        function.  To do that, you need to switch into text mode, like this:\r

        \r
        * **Remember:** in an app screen 0,0 is the
        top left corner and you specify a location by how many pixels from the left
        and how many down from the top of the screen it is.  The screen is **320 by

        # Decision Maker\r
        \r
        Similar
        to the quiz app, a decision tree app asks the user a series of questions.
        The primary difference between the two is that a decision tree doesn't check
        for right or wrong answers, but instead attempts to give the user a suggestion
        or help them make a decision based on their answers.\r
        \r
        This simple decision
        maker asks only three questions,  but more advanced ones actually take the
        form of a tree as seen below:\r
        \r

        \r
        Depending
        on the user's answer to each question, they're given a different page for
        the next question. This allows the app to gradually narrow down the decision
        one question at a time. This type of app can be really useful to help users
        understand complex processes - for example, you might introduce a recycling
        program by using a decision tree app to help users figure out which bin to
        sort items into - first asking what material it's made out of, then whether
        it is clean or not, and so on.\r

        You can use `setText()` to change the text of labels,
        obviously, but it can also be used to change the text on _any_ element that
        has text, including buttons, text input, and text areas.\r

        Add an `onEvent` block to run when the button is clicked\r
        * In the button's
        event handler, set the text of "nameInput" to the appropriate name\r

        style="float:right; max-width: 200px;">\r
        Let's look back at the quiz
        app example that we talked about earlier in this lesson. Recall that we proposed
        a single page that could serve three purposes:\r
        \r
        1. Display the question\r
        2.
        Show if the question was answered correctly\r
        3. Show if the question was
        answered incorrectly\r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        \r
        We've already provided the screen
        for a single question. Before worrying about any code, you just need to set
        this up to ask a question.\r
        \r
        * Change the title to a question that you
        want to ask\r
        * Change the text of the two buttons to two potential answers
        to your question
      CSDU4 Functionality setText quiz 2_markdown_instruction: |-
        # Answering the Question\r
        \r
        Now
        that this screen is asking the question you want it to ask, you'll want to
        make it respond to the answer buttons.\r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        \r
        Instead of
        using the buttons to change screens as we did in earlier quiz apps, each one
        of the answer buttons should change the title to say either "Correct" or
        "Incorrect." For each of the answer buttons:\r
        \r
        * Add an event handler
        to watch the button's ID\r
        * In the event handler, set the title text to
        either "Correct" or Incorrect"\r
        \r
        _Challenge: Create a couple more
        question screens just like this on and make the "Next Question" button navigate
        between them._
      CSDU4 Functionality setText quiz 3_markdown_instruction: |-
        # Don't Skip The
        Question\r
        \r
        The way this screen currently works, a user could just click
        immediately on "Next Question" and not bother answering. Worse still, the
        user could click one answer, see that it's wrong, and then click the other.
        Let's use `hideElement()` and `showElement()` to prevent that.\r
        \r
        # Do
        This\r
        \r
        You'll need to hide or show all three of the buttons in order
        to make this work, so let's focus on one at a time:\r
        \r
        **Next Question**\r
        \r
        The
        "Next Question" button should be hidden to start with, and then show up
        once the question has been answered.\r
        \r
        * In Design Mode, select the "Next
        Question" button and check the "hidden" checkbox. This will make sure the
        button is already hidden when the app starts\r
        * In the event handler for
        each of the answer buttons, add code to show the "Next Question" button\r
        \r
        **Answer
        Buttons**\r
        \r
        * In the event handler for each button, add code to hide
        the question buttons\r
        \t* If you want to allow a user to re-answer using
        only the answers they haven't tried yet, you could hide just the button that
        was clicked

        # Do This\r
        \r
        Using

        # Controlling Visibility\r
        \r
        Earlier
        in this lesson, when we were proposing ways to simplify the quiz app, we mentioned
        that it was possible to show or hide design elements with code. App Lab has
        two functions that let you control the visibility of an element:\r
        \r
        *
        `hideElement()` makes the specified element invisible\r
        * `showElement()`
        makes the specified element visible\r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        \r
        The provided app
        has an image and two buttons.\r
        \r
        * Attach an event handler to the "Hide"
        button that hides the image when clicked\r
        * Attach an event handler to the
        "Show" button that shows the image when clicked
      CSDU4 List App Demo_markdown_instruction: |-
        # List Manager\r
        \r
        The list manager
        app allows user to keep track of the state of information and can be modified
        to serve many different purposes, such as checking in / out loaned items,
        tracking personal To Dos, or keeping track of where things are in a multi-step
        process.\r
        \r
        While this example focuses on a single list, more sophisticated
        list apps could allow the user to create multiple lists, or even move items
        between lists. This app also only keeps track of the name of an item and whether
        or not it is "Done," but it could be extended to track and organize any
        amount of information about the list items.\r
        \r
        # Functionality Missing

        new features - time to do something about it.\r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        \r
        Each
        team member is going to implement select features and bug fixes on their own
        version of the team's app. Start by selecting a sticky note from the **To
        Do** column of your team's chart and moving it to the **Doing** column. For
        each sticky you tackle:\r
        \r
        * Add a comment to the top of your program
        describing the feature or bug fix you are implementing\r
        * Work on your iteration
        until it works. Try to stay focused on only the single feature or bug that
        you've selected.\r
        * When done, move your sticky to the **Done** column,
        pick a new one, and start the process over.
      CSDU4 Project Events_markdown_instruction: |-
        # Linking Screens\r
        \r
        With all
        of your screens in place you can start adding events that will change the
        screens. When you're done with this step you'll actually have an interactive
        prototype!\r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        \r
        For each screen of your app:\r
        \r
        * Find
        all of the button IDs\r
        * For each button, add an event handler that watches
        that ID\r
        * In each event handler, use `setScreen()` to move the the right
        screen\r
        * Test it all out!\r
        \r
        Depending on the number of screens and
        buttons your app has, this can be a pretty involved process. Make sure that
        you test your work often, using `console.log()` blocks to debug any strange
        behavior with your app. When you think you've got the whole thing working,
        compare your app with other members of your group to see if they work the
        same.

        [projects directory](/projects)\r
        * Import each of the screens, one at a
        time\r
        \t* If you run into an ID error with one of the screens, discuss the
        issue with the screen's creator so it can be fixed and imported\r

        # Event Testing:
        \r
        \r
        So far you have only used the 'click' event type. However there
        are lots of other event types. You are going to test out a couple different
        event types for 4 different UI elements (Button, Dropdown, Slider, Text Input).\r
        \r
        **Starter
        Code:** The starting code is set up to react to the *click* event for the
        *button*. When that event fires a message will be logged to the console.\r
        \r
        One
        at a time, **change either the ID or event type**. Run the program and write
        down you observations of when this event fires. Keep going until you have
        tried all the combinations of events in the table.

        \r
        At
        this point you probably have the same code inside each of your event handlers.
        Remember that when you have repeated code it is good to put it into a function.
        Can you use functions to get rid of the repeated code?

        \r
        You've seen how to use getText and setText already. Can
        you make this app get the text the user typed once they hit enter and show
        it in the text area at the bottom?\r
        \r
        _Tip: The "change" event is triggered
        when the user clicks "enter" in a field. Use an event handler for the text
        input watching for the "change" event._

        **Starter
        Code:** The program tries to update the valueDisplay whenever the slider value
        changes but it always sets the value to 10.\r
        \r
        Can you use `getNumber()`
        to get the value of the slider and update the valueDisplay as it changes?
      CSDU6 - UI and Inputs - getNumber_markdown_instruction: |-
        # getNumber\r

        Code:** This program creates a simple calculator but **there is something
        wrong with it. Try putting in 2 + 2.**\r
        \r
        We can fix this by using `getNumber()`
        instead of `getText()`. Can you fix the program by changing `getText()` to
        `getNumber()`?
      CSDU6 - UI and Inputs - getText_markdown_instruction: |-
        # getText\r
        \r
        Try
        to set up an event handler that gets the text from the dropdown whenever a
        user selects a new item from the dropdown. You will need to use the getter
        `getText()`. Whenever you use a getter you should save it in a variable. Use
        `console.log()` to make sure it is working.

        an **`if` statement inside the `for` loop** to individually check every value
        within the array. To practice this, we will create a `for` loop that will
        **display every value in the array greater than 5**.\r

        The
        "Love" Tester is a classic carnival game. It works by having a user place
        their palm flat on a sensor or hold a metal handle. The tester then displays
        how in love that person is. The simplest version of these machines simply
        measure the temperature of the user’s hand and equate more love with a higher
        temperature.\r
        \r
        Test out this "Love" Tester by holding your thumb down
        on your Circuit Playground's temperature sensor. Compare your results with

        In the previous prediction level you saw how the `setScale()`
        method can convert the full range of sensor readings (0-1023) into a range
        that can be used for RGB values (0-255). Let's build on that idea to make
        an app that can communcate the current value of all three analog sensors with
        a single color.\r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        \r
        To start, we just need to set the
        sensor scales correctly - don't worry about actually setting the color of
        the background yet.\r
        \r

        \r
        * Using

        right scale for an RGB color channel.\r
        * Create a variable for each of the
        three colors and assign each one to the `.value` of a different sensor.\r
        *
        Use `console.log()` to test that your variables are in the correct range.\r

        While the sound, light, and temperature all behave in the
        same fashion (converting an analog input to a 10 bit number), the temperature
        sensor is often used a bit differently. Typically if you are using a temperature
        sensor, you want to get a temperature in Fahrenheit or Celsius, not just a
        number in a range. To help with this, the temperature sensor how two special
        blocks, `tempSensor.F` and `tempSensor.C`.\r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        \r
        Using an

        \r
        While
        the light and sound sensors have just a raw value with the `value` property,
        the temperature sensor is a little bit smarter. Instead of `tempSensor.value`,
        there are two properties `tempSensor.F` and `tempSensor.C` which convert the
        raw input value to either Fahrenheit or Celsius.\r

        # State and the Toggle Switch\r
        \r
        The
        toggle switch has the `toggleSwitch.isOpen` property, which keeps track of
        which **state** (opened or closed) the switch is in. `toggleSwitch.isOpen`
        is a boolean, so its value is `true` if the toggle switch is open, and `false`
        if it's closed.\r
        \r
        \r
        ## Do this\r
        \r
         You'll be adding to the if-else
        statement to check if the toggle switch is open or closed.\r
        \r
        * Drag the
        `toggleSwitch.isOpen` block into the condition of the if-statement. Since
        `toggleSwitch.isOpen` is a boolean, the condition reads "If true".\r
        \r
        *
        Add `console.log()` statements that say "open!" if the switch is open, and
        "closed!" otherwise.\r
        \r
        * Run your code and toggle the switch to see
        what happens.\r

        Here's
        the alarm app that you started in the last lesson. Right now it doesn't do
        much, so let's see if we can make it more useful by hooking it up to your
        board. When the alarm is triggered, turn on the red LED. When the alarm is
        stopped, turn the LED off again.\r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        \r
        Add `led.on()` and
        `led.off()` blocks to the events that trigger and disable the alarm.\r
        \r
        _Notice
        that the LED blocks have been moved to a new drawer called Circuit_

        # Turn that LED Off\r
        \r
        Just
        as you can turn your red LED on using `led.on()`, you can turn it back off
        again with `led.off()`. You'll need to add a second button with an event
        handler that calls `led.off()`.\r
        \r
        # Do this\r
        \r
        Add a second button
        and use its "click" event to turn off the LED\r
        \r
        * Drag out a new button
        in Design Mode and give it a good ID\r
        * Insert an event handler for your
        newly created button\r
        * Drag an `led.off()` command into your new event
        handler\r
        \r
        Now you should have two buttons, one that turns the LED on,
        and another that turns it off.\r
        \r
        _Challenge: Can you come up with other
        ways to turn on and off the LED? Could you do it with a single button?_

        The

        to the sprite objects in Game Lab, you can use _dot notation_ to control the
        LED. Try using the command `led.on()` to make your red LED light up when the
        program is run.\r
        \r
        # Do this\r
        \r
        * Drag out the `led.on()` block and
        place it underneath the comment\r

        # Turn on that LED - with a
        Button!\r
        \r
        As exciting as an always-on red LED is, an LED that you can
        turn on with the click of a button seems much more useful. If you add a button
        to your screen in Design Mode, then you can use move your `led.on()` command
        into an `onEvent()` block.\r
        \r
        # Do this\r
        \r
        Add a button and use its
        "click" event to turn on the LED\r
        \r
        * Drag out a new button in Design
        Mode and give it a good ID\r
        * Insert an event handler for your newly created
        button\r
        * Move the code that turns your LED on _inside_ the button's event
        handler\r
        \r
        If everything worked out, you should see that your LED starts
        out off, but turns on when you click the button!

        Back to the
        Alarm now - now with the buzzer we can make this thing really sound like an
        alarm. Using `buzzer.frequency()` and `buzzer.stop()` make your alarm play

        # Playing Sounds\r
        \r
        The `buzzer.frequency()`
        command takes two inputs - the first is the _frequency_ of the sound to be
        played (higher numbers = higher sounds), and the second is the _duration_
        of the sound (how long it should be played)\r
        \r
        # Do This\r

        The provided

        The _duration_ input of the

        \r
        `randomNumber()`
        was still generating a range of numbers from 0 to 2. You added more indexes
        in the array, so checking for the index of 0-2 isn't helpful if there's
        5 items in the array.\r
        \r
        You can fix this by using the **length** of the
        array with `array.length()`. If we generate a random number that's anywhere
        between 0 and the length of the array, you'll be able to play any of the
        elements in the array! Sort of!\r
        \r
        If the array length is 5, and you want
        to select a random index between 0 (the first index) and 5, then the computer
        can select up to 6 possible indexes, which the array doesn't have. To get
        around this, you'll have to subtract 1 from the length of the array like

        You may have
        noticed that if you put the same note side-by-side in the array, the buzzer
        just plays that note as one long sound instead of as individual notes. In

        \r
        `null` is a special
        value that represents emptiness in computer science. `playNotes` plays each
        note for the same duration, so a `null` element in the array is just telling
        `playNotes` to play nothing for the same duration as everything else.\r

        lets you set an LED's brightness (or _intensity_) from 0 - 100. Under the
        hood, this works just like `buzzer.frequency()` by rapidly turning the LED
        on and off to make it seem dimmer.\r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        \r
        The provided program

        `on()` will turn on all three parts of the LED (red, green, and blue) to produce
        white. You'll see a new command in the toolbox called `colorLeds[0].color()`
        which lets you specify a color, either as a string like "blue" or an RGB

        help make your page look better, and potentially strengthen your argument.\r
        \r
        Because
        the Creative Commons provides such a simple way to know what media you can
        and can't use, a lot of search engines have integrated Creative Commons filtering
        to ensure they only give you results you can use. The Creative Commons search
        page (linked below) is a compilation of CC friendly search engines that you
        can use to find media for your page.\r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        \r
        Using the Creative
        Commons Search page, find a handful of pictures that you'll want to use on
        your web pages. By default the search is set to the most restrictive settings.
        Next to the the text **I want something that I can...** you can uncheck _use
        for commercial purposes_. You can also uncheck _modify, adapt, or build upon_
        as long as you don't plan on modifying the images you find (such as adding

        In AppLab
        you can create a new table in an app by clicking the “View Data” button(a
        new browser tab opens) and type in a new, descriptive table name (the table
        name does not have to match the app name, and an app can have more than one
        table), then click the “Add” button next to the table name(another new browser
        tab opens). Click the “Import” button, then the “Choose File” button and select
        the RottenTomatoes2015.csv file (see below). Finally click the “Overwrite
        & Import” button. Note the unique “Id” field created for each record.

        # We've Seen Objects
        Before\r
        \r
        We're going to see how we can use objects to organize data
        in our own apps, but this actually isn't the first time we've used objects
        in our programs. **The object that we've used most frequently is the event
        parameter of our event handlers**. This single object contains many pieces
        of information about the event which can be accessed to determine how to respond
        to the event. For example `event.key` contains the key that was pressed for
        key events, and `event.offsetX` and `event.offsetY` contain the location of
        the mouse for mouse events.\r
        \r
        Before we move on to creating objects of
        our own, let's take another look at this event parameter (or as we'll call
        it now event object) and recall how they were used.\r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        \r

        *
        **Examine the objects displayed in the Debug Console** to recall the different
        pieces of information they contain.\r
        * **Reflect: ** Why wouldn't we want
        this information stored in many variables? Why wouldn't we want this information
        stored in an array?

        that play them, etc)\\r\n- A food (the smells,\ntastes, appearance, etc) \\r\n-
        A place (the sounds, the smells, what natural\nthings are in the space, what
        man-made things are in the space, etc)\\r\n\\r\n>\nOnce you've selected your

      CSPU5 Add Screens to Chaser Game_markdown_instruction: |
        # Improved Chaser Game\r
        \r
        Now
        lets improve the "Chaser Game".  This is where you get to use your creativity.
        Make it look nice!\r
        \r
        In addition you will notice a new command in the
        toolbox: `playsound`! Read the documentation about how to add sounds.\r
        \r
        **Note:**
        Your code from before has been provided for you.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        *
        **Create a Welcome Screen** that explains the rules of the game. Include a
        "Start Game" button.\r
        \r
        * Update the your code so that the **image jumps
        to a new location when it is clicked**. \r
        \r
        * **Play a sound** each time
        the image is clicked.\r
        \r
        * **Add a Game Over Screen** with a lose message
        and button to start over. The Start Over Button should direct back to the
        Welcome Screen.\r
        \r
        * **Make the user lose**, by sending them to the Game
        Over Screen, when the background is clicked.\r
        \r

        style="width: 150px; float: right">\r
        \r
        **Now you try it:** Add a new
        screen and a button to the app we've started here.\r
        \r
        **NOTE:** We've
        created one screen for you - the Hello Screen.  You need to add a new screen
        - the new screen should look something like the example shown to the right.\r
        \r
        Here
        are the steps:\r
        \r
        * **Add a new screen**\r
         * Drag out <img src="https://images.code.org/4337b39cfd797ed9289b70fb6cb365fb-image-1444353631083.17.39
        PM.png" style="width: 50px"> from the Design Toolbox.\r
         * Or choose *New
        Screen...* from the pulldown menu at the top of the app display.\r
         \r
        *
        **Set the background color**\r
         * It doesn't have to be orange like the
        example\r
         \r
        * **Add a Button**\r
         * A simple button is fine.  You can
        embelish with an icon if you want.\r
         * Optional: You can also add a text
        label saying "Goodbye!"\r
        \r
        **Click Run...but...you won't see much**\r
        \r
        *
        Because we haven't added code yet **all you'll see is the (default) Hello
        screen**\r
        * You won't have any way to see the orange screen when the app
        is running.\r
        \r
        **Click Finish** to move on to the next level where we'll
        add code\r
        \r
         * Note: you can continue to work on your design on the next
        level too\r

      CSPU5 Add full screen image to bg of chaser game_markdown_instruction: |-
        # Add

        style="float: right">\r
        \r
        We want to be able to detect when the user
        *misses* clicking on the target. Since we know the screen itself registers
        every click no matter what, the only way to determine that the user missed
        the target is to **add an image that takes up the full screen**.  \r
        \r
        In
        other words we're trying to determine which of two images was clicked - the
        target, or the background - which is do-able since we know when images overlap
        only one will have a click event triggered. \r
        \r
          * When the target is
        clicked, it jumps to a new location\r
          * When the background image is clicked
        we will (eventually) switch to a new screen.\r
        \r
        **Following the Event-Driven
        Pattern...**\r
        \r
        * **Design mode: Add a new image to the game** \r
          *
        and stretch it to fill the whole screen.\r
          * Change the layering order
        (if necessary) so that the target image is in front of the full screen image.\r
          *
        (See example at right which shows an image that is stretched to the full size
        of the screen sitting behind the target image).\r
        \r
        * **Add an onEvent
        handler** for the full screen image with a simple console.log message\r
          *
        **TIP**: this is basically done for you if you add onEvent from Design Mode\r
        \r
        *
        **Run. Test. Debug.**\r
          \r
        Make sure that with each click one of two things
        is happening.\r
         * When the target is clicked, it jumps to a new location
        (and optionally print a message to the console).\r
         * When the background
        image is clicked it should display a message to the console.\r
         * (See example
        console output at right).
      CSPU5 Add game over screen_markdown_instruction: |
        # Add a "game over" screen

        * **Add a new Screen** with a "game over" message
        and **add a button** to start over. \r
        \r
        * **Add an event handler** for
        the "Start Over" Button to send the user back to the Welcome Screen.\r
        \r
        *
        **Add `setScreen` to the event handling function for the background image**\r

        * When the background image is clicked, the user should be sent to the "game
        over" screen you just created.\r
        \r
        <img src="https://images.code.org/bb3c0973ee0d83d3540f5ffed797e442-image-1477405500619.gif"

        \r
        # Run. Test. Debug.\r
        \r
        You
        should now have a 3-screen app with:\r
        \r
        * A welcome screen\r
        * A game
        play screen\r
        * A "game over" screen\r
        \r
        **Avoid dead-ends** -- the
        user should be able to get between all the screens appropriately, and play
        the game.\r
        \r
        If it's not working:\r
        \r
        * Retrace your steps\r
        * See
        if you can figure out where things are going wrong\r
        * Add extra `console.log`
        statements.  \r
        * Ask a friend to help you out.\r

        **You try
        it:** Add an event handler to a button from Design Mode\r

        **Design Mode**\r

        A Red button has already been added to the app.\r
          * In Design Mode click
        on the button to select it\r
          * Click the **EVENTS tab** and then click
        the link that says **Insert and Show Code**\r
          * You may change the ID if
        you like\r
        \r
        This will insert an `onEvent` block with the ID and "click"
        filled in already.\r
        \r
        It also inserts a line of code with a command we
        haven't seen yet: `console.log`.\r
        \r
        **Run. Test. Debug**\r
        * Run the
        program and click on the button to see what happens\r
          * **Hint:** look
        at the **Debug Console** area below the coding workspace.\r
        * If nothing
        happens, retrace your steps and try again.\r
        \r
        Once you see a message displayed
        in the Debug Console click finish to move on.

        </div>\r
        \r
        Let's
        improve your "Chaser Game" by **adding a welcome screen that shows when
        the app starts up, and that with a button to start.**\r
        \r
        * NOTE: we've
        imported the chaser game that you made in the last lesson.  That's the starting
        point for this.  You can continue with this lesson if you don't have it.
        But you'll need to make a screen for game play along the way.\r
        \r
        Following
        the Event Driven Programming pattern:\r
        \r
        1. **Design Mode** \r
          * Add
        a New Screen to the App\r
          * Make this new screen the **default screen**\r
          *
        Add a new Button to the screen that says "Start"\r
          * Add text welcoming
        the user to the game.\r
          * Give the button and the screen meaningful IDs\r
        \r
        2.
        **Add an onEvent Handler for the Button**\r
          * Insert a new onEvent block
        (easy way from Design Mode) for the "start" button\r
        \r
        3. **Add code
        to the event handling function**\r
          * When the "start" button is clicked
        it should `setScreen` to the screen that plays the game.\r
          \r
        4. **Run.
        Test. Debug.**\r
        \r
         Make sure that:\r
         \r
         * When app starts up, your
        new welcome screen shows first\r
         * When you click the "start" button it
        takes you to the game play screen\r
         * Note: right now there's no way to
        get back to the welcome screen - it's okay, we'll add that later.\r

        2.
        Investigate how the screen captures events (it's different).\r

        printed *be descriptive* so that you know exactly what is happening when.\r

        1. When you click on a location where two objects are
        overlapping, which event(s) fire(s)?\r

        <li><em>Always.
        Events that occur on the screen cannot be blocked by other objects.  If you
        set up an event listener for the screen it will capture EVERY event of that
        type, no matter what other UI elements are on the screen.  This behavior of
        the screen is done on purpose and is useful for certain kinds of things.</em></li>\r

        handlers and `console.log` statements, but they are switched around!\r
        \r
        We
        should have given the buttons better ID names so we could tell the difference
        based on the ID. **Can you update the ID names and `console.log` messages

        \r
        # Do This\r

        * **Change the IDs**
        of the buttons in Design Mode to more descriptive names.\r
        \r
        * Switch to
        Code Mode and notice that the **ID pulldowns have been updated to include

        * Will any of them trigger?  Which one(s)?\r

        #
        Debugging Unexpected Behavior\r
        \r
        ## Predict - Observe - Reflect\r
        \r
        To
        understand a new piece of code good programmers often try to **first make
        a prediction about what will happen before running the program**. \r
        \r
        By
        forcing yourself to make a prediction (it doesn't matter if you're right
        or not) you are immediately alerted to any **unusual or unexpected behavior**
        and you can ask yourself, *"Huh? why did it do that?  Was that supposed to
        happen?"*  It might not be an error, but you gain invaluable insight and
        actually **learn faster**.\r
        \r
        **Predict:** For the code that is here,
        what will happen when the "Click Me" button is clicked? \r
        \r
         * **Study
        the code** - This program has **two event handlers** listening for events
        on the same button?\r
         * **Force yourself to make a prediction!** - "I don't
        know" is not a prediction!. \r
        \r
        Here are some options to think about:\r
        \r
        *
        There will be an error in the console immediately after hitting run\r
        * There
        will be an error in the console but not until you hit the button\r
        * Program
        does nothing\r
        * turtle only moves forward\r
        * turtle only turns left\r
        *
        turtle move forward *then* turn left \r
        * turtle turn left *then* move forward?\r
        *
        something else? \r
        \r
        **Observe:** Once you've made a prediction, close
        these instructions and **run the program** to observe what happens.\r
        \r
        **Reflect:**
        Was your prediction correct? If not what about your mental model might need
        to change? Talk about it with a classmate and experiment with the code to
        make sure you understand what is happening.

        **Now You Try it** - add an image to your app
        and modify the code so that the image jumps around the screen rather than
        the button.  Your little game should have:\r
        \r
        * **Text** on the top of
        the screen with a title or instructions for what to do.\r
        * **An image**
        that "runs away" (moves randomly) based on some mouse event.\r
        \r
        **Tips:**\r

        * **Hint** - the easy way to do this is to simply change the IDs in `onEvent`
        and `setPosition` to respond to the image instead of the button.\r
         * Remove
        the button from the app after the image is working.  We don't need it anymore.\r

        * Change the label text so that the instructions make sense for your game.\r

        * The game is even more fun if you use  the `mouseover` event instead of `click`\r
        \r
        **Optional
        Extensions**:\r
         * Make the background interesting\r

        \r
        In our last exercise
        we created our array and initialized it with some values. Another way to do
        this is to **add items to your array on separate lines**. The simplest way
        to do this is to add a new item to the end of your array using the `appendItem`
        command.\r
        \r

        To
        append means to add or to join. When you append an item to an array you actually
        add a new location to the end of the array that contains the new value, so
        that the total size of the array grows by one.  Since you can always add items
        to an array after creating it, it is very common to  **create an empty array
        and then add values in subsequent portions of your program**.\r
        \r
        # Do
        This:\r
        \r
        * **Read the documentation** for `appendItem`.\r
        * Create an
        **empty array** called `oddNumbers`.\r
        * Use `appendItem` to add the odd
        numbers 1-11 to your array.\r

        **Use `console.log`** to confirm your array is holding the correct values.

        seen how we can use bracket notation to reference values stored at specific
        locations in an array. Just like with variables, **we can assign the value
        of a specific location in an array using `=`** (the assignment operator).\r

        The value at index 0 of this array is set to 10.\r

        You will be adding code to your program that calculates the
        sum of the values in the array.\r
        \r
        **Notice** the difference between displaying
        an array as part of a string or by itself.  Example:\r
        \r
        * code: `console.log(myNumbers)`
        displays *with* brackets as: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`\r

        "+myNumbers)` displays *without* brackets as: `my list: 1, 2, 3, 4`\r
        \r
        So
        when it's part of a string it *does not* print the square brackets around
        the ends of the list.  This is a "feature" of the language with no great
        explanation. In the first case it sees only a list and it produces a more
        technical representation. In the second case the system is trying hard to
        convert the list to a nice looking string.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        * **Add
        a variable** to your program to hold the sum of the array values.\r
        * Assign
        the value of the variable to **the sum of the three array values**.\r
        * Use

        written your code to reference your global index then this should only require
        you to decrease its value by one and reuse code that updates the screen output.
        Before we write the code for backwards let's work on cleaning up our code.\r

        **create a function** that updates the screen and then call it every time
        we need to refresh those elements. This will not only make our program easier
        to read and avoids the errors that can arise from redundant code, but it also
        makes it easier to make changes to how our program runs, since all the code

        these commands with **calls to your new function**.\r
        * **Add an event handler**
        to the "Last" button that decreases the **global index variable** by one
        and then updates the screen by calling your new function.\r

        and that the output displayed is correct.\r

        the end of the array moves the index back to 0 and going past the beginning
        of the array sets the index to the last in the array (`list.length` will be

        # Accessing Items in
        an Array\r
        \r
        An array is comprised of many locations. You can individually
        set or reference the information at each location of your array just like
        a variable. To tell your locations apart each has a separate number, or **index**,
        that identifies it.\r
        \r
        Arrays in JavaScript are **zero-indexed** which
        means the first index is 0. This is similar to binary number systems which
        begin counting at 0. For example an array of 10 items would have indexes 0-9.
        As a result **the last index is always one less than the length of the array**.\r
        \r
        **Accessing
        Array Items by Index:** If you know the index of the item you wish to access
        you can reference it using square brackets `list[index]` . The example below
        prints the value of the 4th element in the array.  \r

        index in your array. **If you want to avoid these kinds of errors then it

        # Fix
        the "Original" Button\r
        \r
        Our "Original" button is now slightly broken
        because the effect it renders doesn't match our new free-form drawing which
        takes the movement of the mouse into account - it just draws fixed-size cricles.\r
        \r
        Let's
        fix the "Original" button.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        In the event handler
        function for the "Original" button:\r
        \r
        * Change the value used for the
        radius from a fixed value to the same thing calculated for the free-form drawing.
        Since you wrote a function to do this calculation, it should be easy to call
        it from this code as well!\r
        * The **slight difference will be that you will
        be looping over the array of events.**  So the line of code that draws the
        circle might look like the one below. This line of code is certainly a mouthful,
        but it's basically the same as the line of code in your `mousemove` event
        handler; **it just references the event in the list instead.** <br><img src="https://images.code.org/dbb4cd9b98eba70aa2919a93544c1e03-image-1448314845862.40.21

        doing free-form drawing.\r

        # Adjusting Circle
        Size\r
        \r
        Among the other pieces of information contained in each `event`
        parameter are the values `movementX` and `movementY`. These numbers tell us
        how far (in pixels) the mouse moved since the last mouse event was triggered,
        and can be used to measure the speed of the mouse. ** If the movement is large,
        the mouse is moving fast; if the movement is small, the mouse is moving slowly.**\r
        \r
        Let's
        use the mouse movement speed to make a cool effect. When we draw with a real
        pen or brush, the line usually gets thin when making quick strokes and is
        wider and darker when making slower ones. We can generate this effect by **using
        `movementX` and `movementY` to calculate the radius for the circle.**  Since
        this calculation might be a little tricky, a smart thing to do would be to
        **write a function** that takes `movementX` and `movementY` as parameters
        and **returns** a value that should be used as the radius.\r
        \r
        <img src="https://images.code.org/b9dc4c20d44af7b4e7725b71cd35fa2b-image-1448313734191.21.43

        \r
        There
        are several ways to do this. One possible way to write the function is provided
        on the right, which uses some arithmetic tricks. The function to the right
        is actually only three lines of code but is heavily commented to explain what
        it's doing. It makes use of a function called **`Math.abs` which returns
        the absolute value of a number.** Feel free to use this or another method
        of converting `movementX` and `movementY` into a radius.\r
        \r
        <details>
        <summary><strong>What is Absolute Value?</strong> [click to expand]</summary>\r
        `Math.abs`
        takes a number as input and returns the positive version of this number. \r
        \r
        In
        math, absolute value is often written with this | | symbol. So |10| is the
        absolute value of ten and |-10| is the absolute value of negative ten. Both
        evaluate to 10.\r
        \r
        In Javascript we use `Math.abs` instead of | |.  `Math.abs(-10)`
        and `Math.abs(10)` both evaluate to <strong>10</strong>.\r
        </details> <br>\r
        \r
        #
        Do This:\r
        \r
        * **Write a function like the one above** that accepts two
        parameters (one each for `movementX` and `movementY`) and returns a radius.
        A higher speed should lead to a smaller radius.\r
        * **Inside your `mousemove`
        event handler,** set the radius of the circle to the value returned by your
        function, where the function takes `event.movementX` and `event.movementY`
        as input.  For example, if using the function above, your code would be: <br>![](https://images.code.org/94a379336084954ba2ab27e80b17dee3-image-1448314255797.30.22

        Now we're ready to write the code for our "Random" effect.
        To do this, we will be clearing the canvas and then processing the array `eventList`
        to redraw all the dots with a random radius. \r
        \r
        You already set up the
        clear canvas, so next we'll need to process our array in order to find out
        the event information for each dot. You'll need to create a `for` loop that
        iterates through every index in `eventList` (recall the `length` command).
        Within your loop, you will be drawing dots referencing items stored in the
        array. \r
        \r
        As you write this code, remember that **you can treat an individual
        element of an array exactly like the kind of data it stores**. Inside a `for`
        loop, the event at index `i` can be accessed with the notation `eventList[i]`
        and the `offsetX` of that event can be accessed with `eventList[i].offsetX`.
        Again, you are essentially treating the array element as if it were the data
        it contains.\r

        # Relative Indexes\r
        \r
        When
        looping over an array, we use a counter variable (typically `i`) to keep track
        of which index we're at. We can then access the contents at each index with
        the syntax `list[i]`.\r
        \r
        If we want, however, we could access the contents
        of the next element as well, since its index is just one greater. For example,
        if we are currently focused on the element at index `i`, then `list[i+1]`
        gives us access to the next element in the array. In other words, you can
        **reference indexes relative to your counter variable**.\r
        \r

        \r
        We
        are going to use relative indexing to create our final effect, which will
        look sort of like an etching of the image. The idea is simple:  **for every
        (x,&nbsp;y) location in the event list, draw a straight line between that
        location and the location stored 10 spots further down the array.** You will
        use the **`line` command** to draw a line connecting these points.\r
        \r
        #
        Do This:\r
        \r
        * **Read the documentation for `line`**.\r
        * **Set the style
        of the final button** in Design Mode, give a label like "Etch," give it
        a descriptive ID, and attach a click event handler to it.\r
        * **Call `clearCanvas`**
        to clear the screen.\r
        * Create a `for` loop that counts from **0 to `eventList.length
        - 10`**. \r
        \t* Why do you think we're not counting over the entire array?\r
        *
        Use `line` to draw a line between the (x,&nbsp;y) locations of `eventList[i]`
        and `eventList[i+10]`.  The full line of code will be another big one: ![](https://images.code.org/5de2c40b56042069379ff20ce5d10cab-image-1448393948598.38.49

        with Nested Loops\r
        \r
        In order to make "Spray Paint" look more real you
        will need to draw multiple dots randomly placed around the original x and
        y locations. In order to do this, you will place one `for` loop inside of
        another, also known as a **nested loop**. You already have the main loop which
        visits every index in `eventList`. The inner loop should **draw 5 circles
        whose x and y locations use `offsetX` and `offsetY` with a small random value
        added**.   \r

        **When nesting loops, it
        is important that you use different variables to count your iterations**.
        Look at the example at right.  These nested loops effectively say: **"for
        every possible value in `eventList.length`, run a loop 5 times".  **\r
        \r
        Since
        `i` is used as the counter variable in the outer loop, we need to use a *different
        counter variable for the inner `for` loop*, or things will go haywire. Why?
        **If both loops used `i` as a counter variable, the inner loop would keep
        changing `i` and the outer loop wouldn't count properly.** The example uses
        `j` as the inner loop variable, but you could use anything that's *not* `i`.\r

        \r
        We would like to make our dots transparent so that we can
        see when they are drawn on top of each other. To set the color and transparency
        of shapes you draw on your canvas, you need to change both the **stroke**
        or outline color and the **fill** color. The functions `setStrokeColor` and
        `setFillColor` can be used to set those colors. \r
        \r
        These functions **accept
        strings of the form `"rgba(100, 200, 100, 0.5)"` as input**. The first three
        values in the string are RGB values and the last value is the transparency,
        as represented by a decimal number between 0 and 1.0.  All together it looks
        like this:\r

        # The Event Parameter
        for Mouse Events\r
        \r
        We'd like to change the app so that when the user
        clicks on the canvas we draw a circle right where they clicked. To do that,
        we need to learn more about the **parameter passed by our event handler function,
        which by default is called `event`**.\r
        \r
        Recall that when we wanted to
        know what key the user pressed on a `keyPress` event, we checked the value
        stored in `event.key`. **The event parameter actually stores a great deal
        more information about each event**. \r
        \r
        When using the mouse, the event
        parameter carries information like the location of the mouse, how fast it's
        moving, and some other things as well. \r
        \r
        Let's get acquainted with
        the event parameter and what we can find out about the mouse.\r
        \r
        # Do
        This:\r
        \r
        * Add a `console.log` command inside the function of your event
        handler. Use it to display the `event` parameter.\r
        * Run your program and
        click your canvas. **The full contents of the `event` parameter should be
        displayed in the console**. \r
        * **Which values do you think hold the x and
        y coordinates**?  What else is there?\r
        * We won't use all of these, but
        it's interesting to see just how much is available.\r
        * Once you have experimented
        a little, move to the next level.\r

        # Combining
        AND and OR and NOT\r
        \r
        You can stick a NOT (`!`) in front of any boolean
        expression to invert its result. This opens the door to express the same logical
        statements in different ways.  \r
        \r
        For example, let's say you want to
        determine if a person, based on his or her age (under 12 or over 65) gets
        to pay a reduced price for a movie ticket.  You might express that like this:\r
        \r
        ```\r
        //
        If your age is less than 12 or greater than 65\r
        if( (age < 12) || (age >
        65) ){\r
        \twrite("You qualify for a reduced price!");\r
        }\r
        ```\r
        \r
        But
        you might also figure out a way to determine if a person gets a reduced price
        ticket by determining if his or her age is between 12 and 65 (`(age >= 12)
        && (age <= 65)`) and then taking the inverse of that.  So using the NOT operator
        this would work as well:\r
        \r
        ```\r
        // If your age is NOT between 12 and
        65\r
        if( !( (age >= 12) && (age <= 65) ) ){\r
        \twrite("You qualify for
        a reduced price!");\r
        }\r
        ```\r
        \r
        **Why use one over the other?** Personal
        preference.  Use the one that makes the most sense to you, but it should be
        a clear expression of what you are trying to say.  \r
        \r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        We've
        provided you with starting code that prompts the user to enter a **day** and
        their **age** and store it in variables.\r
        \r
        **Add an `if` statement that
        uses both AND and OR operators**\r
        \r
         * The app should write "Time for
        school!" if it's a weekday and the user is under 18.\r
         \t* Hint: one way
        to say that it's a weekday is to say that it's NOT a weekend.\r
         * Otherwise,
        if it's a weekday and the user is 18 or older, it should write "Time to
        go to work!"\r
         * Otherwise, it should write "Time to relax for the weekend!"\r

        \r
         \r
        **WARNING** logic can get tricky sometimes.  Make sure to test your
        program with inputs that cover every possibility. There are 4 basic cases
        to test for:\r
        \r
         * It is a weekday and age is under 18\r
         * It is a weekday
        and age is not under 18\r

        Screens\r
        \r
        In the last level you made two screens, a black one and a white
        one. However when you ran the app you probably noticed that you had no way
        to see the second screen. Let's fix that.\r
        \r
        In order to switch between
        screens we have added a new command: `setScreen`. Read the documentation to
        figure out how this command works.\r
        \r

        \r
        **Goal:** Make a 2 screen app
        which can switch back and forth between a black screen and a white screen
        using buttons.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        * **Put a button on each screen**.  \r
        \r
        *
        **Set up event handlers** for each of your buttons. \r
        \r
        * **Use the `setScreen`
        block to switch screens** when the buttons are clicked.\r
        \r
        * Test out
        your app to make sure you can switch back and forth between the two screens.

        In this guess-the-number game, the starting code tells
        the user whether they were right or wrong.  Let's help the user out even
        more by telling them if they guessed correctly or if their guess was too high

        right.\r
        * Their guess was higher than the number.\r
        * Their guess was lower

        # Buttons and Keys\r
        \r
        We
        now know how to respond to key events, but often we want the user to be able
        to **do the same thing with the app in multiple ways**. For example, we might
        want the app to exhibit the same behavior if the user clicks a button on the
        screen or a key on the keyboard. (This is how so-called "keyboard shortcuts"
        work.)\r
        \r
        In the program you're about to see, we've provided event handlers
        for some buttons on the screen. You're going to **create identical functionality**
        for the key events.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        * **Add conditional statements
        inside the `keydown` event handler** to check for when the **up and down arrows**

        # Refactoring Code\r
        \r
        On
        the last level, we copied a few lines of code to a different part of our program.
        **Hopefully warning bells went off in your head!** Any time you are copying
        portions of code from one area of your program to another, it's a good indication
        that you should write a function to capture that behavior in one place. \r
        \r
        When
        you add new features to your code **you will often create redundancies**.
        To keep your code readable and consistent, you may need to rewrite old pieces
        of code. This process of restructuring existing code without changing its
        external behavior is called **refactoring**. It is an important process when
        developing software that improves code readability and reduces complexity.
        As a result, code is much easier to maintain.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        * **Create
        a function called `doUpArrow`**. \r
        * Move the code from the `upArrow` event
        handler to the function.\r
        * **Call `doUpArrow`** from both your button and
        key event handlers. (The animation below shows the steps above.)\r
        * Repeat
        the same process for the down arrow / button by creating a function called
        `doDownArrow`.\r
        * Once you have **removed these redundancies from your code**
        test your app to make sure it still works!\r

      CSPU5_U3 - Loops -  Complex Condition_markdown_instruction: |-
        # Expressing Stopping
        Conditions: "Until Loops"\r
        It is often more natural to think about looping
        in terms of when the loop should end rather than when it should continue.
        For example you might say "keep going down the road until you see the gas
        station" or "keep calling until you get through to someone." You might
        think of these as "until loops" rather than "while loops," since we want
        the loop to continue **until a condition is true rather than while a condition
        is true**.\r
        \r
        **There is no "until loop" in JavaScript** but it is actually
        quite easy to translate "until loops" into `while` loops so that you can
        use them in programs. An "until loop" runs *until* a condition is true,
        as opposed to a while loop which runs *as long as* a condition is true.  That
        means an until loop is the logical inverse of a while loop - it runs as long
        as the **condition is false**. The table below shows how you can use the **NOT**
        ( `!` ) operator to translate stopping conditions into `while` loop conditions.\r
        \r
        |
        Expressed as Stopping | Expressed as Until Loop | Expressed as While Loop
        |\r
        | --- | --- | --- |\r
        | **Stop** once you reach the gas station | Keep
        going **until** you reach the gas station | Keep going **while** you have
        **NOT** reached the gas station|\r
        | **Stop** calling when you get through
        to someone | Keep calling **until** you get through to someone | Keep calling
        **while** you have **NOT** gotten through to someone|\r
        | **Stop** when `x
        == y` | `until(x == y){...` | `while(!(x == y)){...`|\r
        <br>\r
        Note how
        we can use the **NOT** operation to find the **logical inverse** (or opposite)
        of the condition from our "until loop" to create a `while` loop. Let's
        do a little practice of that now.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        **Starter code**
        is provided that repeatedly rolls two dice and writes their values to the
        screen. **Careful: ** before you edit this code it creates an infinite loop.\r
        \r
        *
        Use the technique above to **modify this code** so that the loop **stops when
        both dice are 5 or greater**.\r
        * **Try it out and experiment.** You should
        exit the loop the first time both dice have values greater than or equal to
        5 displayed.\r

         **The `while` loop
        uses a boolean condition to repeatedly run a block of code.**  It checks the
        expression, and if it is true it runs the block of code contained within it.
        This process of checking the condition and running the block of code is repeated
        as long as the boolean condition remains true. **Once the boolean expression
        becomes false it will stop.**\r
        \r
        We are going to start exploring a `while`
        loop by **modifying the condition on which a `while` loop runs and using `console.log`
        to ensure it is correctly evaluating its condition**.\r

        \r
        Instead
        of writing code that makes the loop run a random number of times, we can control
        the `while` loop by changing the variable used in the boolean expression differently.
        Let’s try just printing a string 5 times.\r

        count by 4's. \r

        \r
        We
        wanted to stop counting at 30, but when you count by 4 you will actually never
        hit 30. It would go... 24, 28, 32, 36...  What we really want to do is stop
        when the number is **greater than 30**. This is an important defensive programming
        strategy. Make the condition catch more cases than you think you need so that
        if for some reason something does not go exactly as you planned it will hit
        the stop condition and not go infinitely.\r

        # Using an *if* Statement In a
        Loop\r
        \r
        A common thing to do is to use variables to keep track of some
        sort of count.  When used in a loop we count things very quickly.\r
        \r
        **Scenario:**\r
        If
        you roll a pair of dice, rolling a 12 (two sixes) is rare.  How rare?  If
        you were to roll a pair of dice 1,000 times, on average, how many times would
        it come up as 12?\r
        \r
        To figure this out, we could write code to run an
        experiment. It would go something like this:\r
        * Make a loop that simulates
        rolling a pair of dice 1,000 times.\r
        * Inside the loop, add an `if` statement:
        **if die1 + die2 == 12, then add 1 to a counter**.\r
        * After the loop, display
        the result.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        The **starter code** sets up the whole experiment
        for you, except it doesn't count the number of 12's rolled - that's your
        job.\r
        \r
        * **Run the code** to see what the experiment does.\r
        \r
        * **
        Add an `if` statement inside the loop** to check if the sum of the dice is
        equal to 12, and add 1 to `twelveCount`.\r
        \r
        *  Once the loop has completed,
        **display the number of times the sum was 12.**\r
        \r
        **Note:** If you remove
        (or comment out) the `console.log` statement that displays every roll of the
        dice, the experiment will speed up A LOT!  You could do tens of thousands
        of dice rolls in a matter of seconds.

        `while`
        loops run until their condition becomes false, which raises an interesting
        question.  **What happens if the condition never becomes false**? In these
        cases the program enters what is called an **infinite loop** over the commands
        in the `while` loop, and it never reaches the rest of your program. **We normally

        Using these tools we can investigate

        In order
        for a `while` loop to stop at some point, the code inside the loop **must
        change something about the state of the program** - usually the value of a
        variable - so that eventually the boolean expression becomes false.  Otherwise
        you'd have an infinite loop!\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r

        inside the `while` loop** which will **update the variable `num` so that the
        condition will eventually become false.**\r

        # Starting Condition\r
        \r
        We
        have seen that loops can run infinitely. On the last level we saw that there
        is also the **chance that the loop never runs at all!** If the condition of
        the `while` loop starts out false then the loop will never run.\r
        \r
        We
        fixed this problem in the last exercise by displaying the value of `num` in
        two places: before the loop and in the loop. Duplicating code is generally
        a bad strategy, so the question is: can we be a little clever and get into
        the loop without missing any values?  The answer is yes.\r
        \r
        **The solution**
        is to initialize the values used in our boolean expression so that we are
        **certain** it will evaluate to true the first time the loop checks it.  **For
        example, if your loop condition is: `while (num != 6)` you could initialize
        `num` to anything other than 6 and you'd know that you get into the loop**.  \r
        \r
        If
        you use this technique though...\r
        1. You need to make sure you set the value
        of `num` right away inside the loop.\r
        2. You probably want to use a nonsense
        value like -1, so that if you ever see that displayed it will be obvious something
        is wrong and be easier to debug.\r

        it subtracts the value provided from the variable. Let's use this operator

        \r
        Sometimes you want to add or subtract something
        *other than 1* from the current value of a variable. If you wanted to add
        or subtract 3 for example, such as: `count = count + 3` or `count = count
        - 3`, `++` and `--` wouldn’t help. \r
        \r
        It turns out this is pretty common
        as well so there is actually a shorthand version of `count = count + 3`. \r
        \r
        **Introducing
        `+=`  and `-=`**!\r
        \r
        We can use the `+=` or `-=` operator to add or subtract
        any value we want to the current value of a variable. \r
        \r
        So, the shorthand
        versions of `count = count + 3` and `count = count - 3` would be:\r
         * `count
        += 3` \r
         * `count -= 3`\r
        \r
        **Notice** that these 3 statements: `count
        = count + 1`,  `count++`, and `count += 1` all do **exactly** the same thing!\r
        \r
        Which
        one you use as a programmer is your choice, and in the future you can use
        either version, but try out the new operator here.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r

        **Change the code to use `count += 3`** instead of `count = count + 3` so

        do this.) \r

        The `for` loop you set up on the last

        This `for` loop basically means **"for every possible index
        in `myArray`..."** and we use it as a basic building block for processing
        arrays. Common array-processing techniques like searching for a value, updating
        all values, or calculating simple stats on an array will all be completed
        using a `for` loop written with the syntax above.\r
        \r
        In fact, we're going
        to see that happen right now as we **use a `for` loop to add 5 to every value
        in an array**.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        **Starter code** has been provided that

        over every index in the array.\r
        \r
        * Add code inside the loop to **add
        5 to the value at every location in the array**. \r
        \t* ** Remember: ** `myArray[i]`
        refers to the element in the array at the current value of `i`.\r
        * Confirm
        your code works by **displaying the values in your array before and after
        your loop**. Below is a sample result.  Notice how, after the array has been
        processed, all of the values are 5 greater than the originals.\r

        Occurrences of a Value\r
        \r
        Instead of displaying a true/false value for
        *every* item in the list, let's compute one value and display it.  A common
        thing to want to do is **count** the number of times a value occurs.  We can
        do this with a very small change to the code we've already got. \r
        \r
        #
        Do This:\r
        **Starter Code** is similar to past levels.  We've also created
        a variable called `fiveCount`.\r
        \r
        * ** Add an `if` statement** inside
        the `for` loop to **increment `fiveCount` if the value is equal to 5. **\r

        (Note: this will be exactly the same as the `if` statement you wrote in the
        previous level. Just giving you more practice).\r
        \r
        * **Run and re-run
        your code** to make sure that it's accurately counting the number of 5's
        in the array. Since the array is getting a random set of values every time
        you run the program, you might have to run it a bunch of times to thoroughly
        test it. Make sure you get it to run at least once when no 5's appear in
        the array.\r
        \r
        * Finally, if you'd like to, **change the first loop in
        the program to add 100 items to the array** instead of 10. Your code should
        still work to count the number of 5's, no matter how big the original array
        is!

        It's very common to want to repeat a set of commands a particular

        the value of the counter by 1 each time. We've also used the `for` loop before,

        To begin, we'll start simple. We'll write

        In this `for` loop, the `i` eventually gets set to every possible
        index in the array. You are going to use a loop of this kind to display all
        the values in an array.\r

        There are two cases to consider: \r

        #
        Using a Boolean Variable as a Flag\r
        \r
        We are going to do a **challenge
        that is similar to the last exercise** but, rather than counting the number
        of 5's in the array, we're going to use a different **interesting programming
        technique for processing arrays** that might prove useful to you in the future.
        \r
        \r
        # Using a Boolean Flag\r
        \r
        <img src="https://images.code.org/756fcab9d5f48ace76eb5d300fcf58af-image-1447624065160.png"
        style="float: right; width: 250px">\r
        The technique is generally referred
        to as **using a boolean "flag."** To understand this idea, think about how
        some mailboxes work: the flag starts down, and when a person wants to let
        the mail carrier know there is something to pick up, she puts the flag up
        to notify the mail carrier that there is outgoing mail in the box.\r
        \r
        We
        can use a variable to do something similar when programming. Rather than incrementing
        a count every time we find a 5 in the array, we will use a variable that acts
        like a **flag**.  We will create a variable before the loop and assign it
        `false` to start (flag is down). Then, as we process the array, if we find
        a 5, set the variable to `true` (put the flag up).  \r
        \r
        Here is some pseudocode:\r
        ```\r
        var
        flag = FALSE\r
        FOR EACH item IN list\r
          IF (item EQUALS 5)\r
            flag
        = TRUE\r
            \r
        DISPLAY (flag)\r
        ```\r
        Notice that it doesn't matter
        if we find more than one 5.  It will just keep setting the flag to `true`.  However,
        if there are no 5's, the `if` statement in the loop will never execute, and
        so the variable will remain the value it was initialized to, which was `false`.\r
        \r
        #
        Do This:\r
        \r
        * **Implement the pseudocode above** in JavaScript. \r
        *
        We've given you code that constructs an array of random values, and the standard
        `for` loop for looping over an array.\r
        * The output will be no different
        from the previous exercise, but you should still **confirm that your program
        correctly identifies when a 5 is in the array.**\r

        | No 5's |\r

        Rating to Keywords\r
        \r
        Up until now our movie suggestions have just been
        based on genre. Let's now also look for keywords related to the movie rating
        like "G", "PG", "PG-13", and "R" so we can give movie suggestions
        based on both genre and rating.\r

        **Note
        2: ** The logic of the program right now will yield some odd results - there
        are some things you can type that will give 2 suggestions - this is expected,
        for now.  We are just taking a small step here.  We'll refine the code again

        keywords for movie ratings (G, PG, PG-13, and R).**\r
        \r
        * **Hint:** When
        checking for "G", "PG" and "R" you need to be a little clever.  R and
        G are letters that will show up in lots of words and PG will get confused
        with PG-13. We want to check for "g" and "r" with spaces on either side.
        So make sure to use `" g "` where there is a space on either side of g instead
        of `"g"`. For "pg" you can just add a space after the pg to look for `"pg

        This exercise comes with starter

        We're going to debug another
        function that uses multiple return statements. The function is called `constrain`
        and is used to limit an input number to a certain range. The function accepts
        three parameters.\r
        \r
        * `input` : the number to be constrained.\r
        * `low`
        : the lower bound of the range. If `input` is below this value, the function
        should return the value of `low`.\r
        * `high` : the upper bound of the range.
        If `input` is above this value, the function should return the value of `high`.\r

        Unfortunately,
        because of the way this function was written, it does not always work as expected.

        We're going to look at some examples of functions with return values that
        include logical errors and debug them. The goal is to **recognize common errors
        with return values now so you can avoid them when writing your own programs**.\r
        \r
        There
        is a logical error somewhere in the version of `maxVal` you are about to see
        which uses multiple return statements. As a result, the function works correctly
        for some inputs but not all. You'll need to inspect the code to understand
        what the issue is and make changes accordingly. In particular, look closely
        for conditions that are *not* currently handled by the program.\r
        \r
        # Do
        This:\r
        \r
        * **Run the program** and identify the errors generated in the
        output.\r
        * **Inspect the logic of `maxVal`** to identify the logical error.\r
        *
        **Correct the logical error** so that the function returns the correct value
        for all inputs.

        We have used functions that return values many times

        using the `return` command. The function `minVal` accepts two numbers as input
        and returns the minimum of the two as output. You can call this function just
        like any other, and **because it returns a number, you can treat the function
        call as if it were a number**.\r

        This time, you're going to
        write a function that returns a value to add functionality to the turtle driver.
        The `updateTurtle` function now is making a call to a function called `wrap`
        that has not been written yet. It accepts three parameters and should work
        in the following way:\r
        \r
        * `input`: the input value to the function. If
        it is within the range it should just be returned.\r
        * `low`: the lower bound
        of the range. If `input` is below this value the output should be the value
        of `high`.\r
        * `high`: the upper bound of the range. If `input` is above
        this value the output should be the value of `low`.\r
        \r
        By using this function
        you can create the illusion that the screen "wraps" around, so when the
        turtle leaves the top of the screen it appears again at the bottom.\r

        # Starting Small\r
        \r
        To
        start, we're going to simulate flipping a coin 10 times. You might be thinking
        that isn't many coin flips, and that we could just do those flips in real
        life, but this is actually an important step in developing a simulation. At
        small scales we can make sure our code is working as intended because **we
        can still visually confirm its output**. Once we're convinced that the logic
        of our program is reliable we'll move up to simulating larger numbers of
        flips.\r
        \r
        The core logic of our program will be focused on **a `while`
        loop** that simulates flipping a coin by repeatedly generating **random 0's
        or 1's using `randomNumber`**. This is a great opportunity to keep practicing
        using loops while applying your knowledge of variables, iteration, and `if`
        statements.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        * When we want to flip a coin with a
        computer we will instead **generate a random number between 0 and 1**.\r
        *
        Write a program that **uses a `while` loop** to **flip a coin 10 times** and
        writes the value of each flip to the screen. The example below shows how your
        program should run.\r
        * **HINT:** you will need to use a counter variable
        in your `while` loop to keep track of how many times the coin has been flipped.

        # Changing the Loop Condition\r
        \r
        Currently
        our loop condition is based on a counter variable that keeps track of the
        total number of flips, but our simulation should only run **while we have
        fewer than the target number of heads**. In this exercise you are going to
        change the condition used by your `while` loop so that your **simulation terminates
        once you have flipped 5 total heads**. At the end of the loop we will **write
        the total number of flips** to know how many flips it took to get 5 heads.\r
        \r
        #
        Do This:\r
        \r
        * Change the looping condition to use the variable you are
        using to keep track of the number of heads. **Your loop should run as long
        as you have fewer than 5 total heads**.\r
        * Add code after your loop that
        **writes the total number of flips**.\r
        * **Test your program** several times
        to make sure it works as expected. See the example below.\r
        * **Note:** the
        simulation is always terminating once it flips its 5th heads. Sometimes this
        means the text output runs off the screen. We will address this in the next

        about your model you will **first change the number of heads you are looking
        for to a number that we can still visually verify (7 heads)**. If our code
        still works after making changes then we should be confident that it should
        work at 10,000. We will remove the intermediate output and run the full simulation!\r
        \r

        line of code. Make sure that the total count of flips still prints though!\r

        **Run your simulation and find out how long it takes to get to 10,000 heads**.

        a certain number of heads then **we will need a way to count the number of
        heads that have been flipped**. In order to do this you will need to add a
        variable that acts **as a counter**. Initialize it to 0, and every time you
        flip a heads (1) **increment your counter by 1**. At the end of your program
        you should write the value to the screen.\r

        style="float: right">\r
        When you have a statement like `result = 5 + 7;`
        realize that this **does NOT store a mathematical expression in the variable.**  \r
        \r
        Rather,
        with this instruction you are asking to compute 5 + 7 and **THEN** store the
        answer (a single number) in the variable.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        **GOAL:**
        the goal here is mostly to acquaint yourself with typing arithmetic expressions
        - the answers to the questions below are less important, and should be used
        as interesting things to investigate.  \r
        \r
        We've given you some **starting
        code** with 5 statements similar to ones in the table above.\r
        * **Add `console.log`
        or `write` statements** to display the values of each of the variables.\r
        *
        Experiment with arithmetic expressions, try to make really big and really
        small numbers.\r
        \r
        <hr>\r
        \r
        **Things to Try:**\r
        * Using **multiplication:
        what's the biggest a number you can store** in a variable?\r
         * How many
        digits are in the biggest number before it starts using scientific notation?\r
        *
        Using **subtraction (or multiplication with negative numbers): what's the
        lowest number you store?** (low means a negative number with a lot of digits)\r
        *
        Using **parentheses** make a crazy-big arithmetic expression.  \r
         * NOTE:
        composing arithmetic expressions is ***much* easier in text mode**, and is
        actually almost unreadable in block mode.  Try doing this in text mode.\r

        # Getting Started
        with Your Digital Assistant\r
        \r
        <img src="https://images.code.org/e875ff7b54c314a378cdb784f92371a0-image-1445989933171.52.04.png"
        style="width:200px;float:right;">\r
        Over the course of the next few lessons,
        you'll be __developing your own digital assistant__. To make your digital
        assistant more useful, it needs to be able to make __decisions__ based on
        questions the user asks it, and respond intelligently.\r
        \r
        To get started,
        __choose a topic__ you want your digital assistant to specialize in. It should
        be something you are interested in and know a lot about. Examples: Country
        Music, Sushi, College Football, Comedy Movies.\r
        \r
        You'll next set up
        the layout for your app. __The basic layout contains just two primary design
        elements:__ a text input and a text area.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        - __Choose
        a topic__ for your digital assistant to specialize in.\r
        - __Create the layout__
        for your app. Your digital assistant should have:\r
            - A name\r
            -
        A text input for the user to ask a question\r
            - A text area for the digital
        assistant to respond\r
            - The text area should have a greeting for the
        user (e.g. Ask me a question about movies!)\r
      CSPU5_U3 Digital Assistant Set Text_markdown_instruction: |-
        # Respond to Basic
        User Input\r

        style="width:200px;float:right;">\r
        Now you can have your digital assistant
        repeat what the user typed and add a __default response__. It's not the most
        intelligent response, but you'll build up to that over the next couple of
        lessons and it's important to build this program in pieces.  \r
        \r
        # Looking
        Back to Move Forward\r
        You're going to now add to your program without as
        much guidance as usual. Keep in mind that __this is very similar to programs
        you've already built__, so look back at your work for a refresher.\r
        - __Mad
        Libs:__ In Mad Libs you got a user's text when the 'Next' button was clicked,
        filled in the outline with the responses, and displayed the completed Mad
        Lib\r
        - __Introducing the 'change' event:__ You just learned about the
        'change' event that triggers when the user hits 'enter' on a text input.\r
        \r
        #
        Do This:\r
        - __Take the user's question and output it to the text area__
        when the 'enter' key is pressed in the text input\r
        - The response should
        also __include a default phrase__ such as _"I don't know about that yet!"_\r
        -
        __Format the response with newline characters__ to separate the user's response
        from the assistant's response.: `\n`\r
        - The __text input should clear__
        after the user hits 'enter'

        __While digital assistants may seem like magic,
        they are just elaborate computer programs that parse, or process, text__ looking
        for combinations of words to make decisions about what to reply.\r
        \r
        Over
        the next few lessons, __you're going to build up your own digital assistant
        that responds "intelligently" to a user's question__, by making a decision
        about what to reply based on the contents.\r
        \r
        You'll now __explore a
        demo digital assistant__, Movie Bot, that represents the kind of program that
        you'll build up to. Try out some of the prompts below and also try your own.
        You'll quickly find the limits of what this program can and can't do.\r
        \r
        #
        Do This:\r
        __Run Movie Bot. In the _'enter your question here'_ input,
        type each of the following prompts and hit 'enter.' __\r
        - 'help'\r
        -
        'What is the best PG comedy movie ever?'\r
        - 'What PG comedy movie should
        I watch next?'\r
        - 'Could you please tell me the best romance movie?'\r

        - 'What is the capital of Kentucky?'\r
        -

        It's so common to want to create a variable and give

        \r
        * **Create a variable called `lives`** and **assign it the value
        3** using the new one-line version of this command. (See animation at right.)\r

        # Predict - Observe
        - Reflect\r
        Here's another one.  \r
        \r
        To understand a new piece of code
        good programmers often try to **first make a prediction about what will happen
        before running the program**. \r
        \r
        By forcing yourself to make a prediction
        (it doesn't matter if you're right or not) you are immediately alerted to
        any **unusual or unexpected behavior** and you can ask yourself, *"Huh? why
        did it do that?  Was that supposed to happen?"*  It might not be an error,
        but you gain invaluable insight and actually **learn faster**.\r
        \r
        **Predict:**
        For the code that is here, what will happen when the "Forward" button is
        clicked? \r
        \r
         * **Study the code** - This program has **two event handlers**
        listening for events on the same button?\r
         * **Force yourself to make a
        prediction!** - "I don't know" is not a prediction!. \r
        \r
        Here are some
        options to think about:\r
        \r
        * There will be an error in the console immediately
        after hitting run\r
        * There will be an error in the console but not until
        you hit the button\r
        * Program does nothing\r
        * turtle only moves forward\r
        *
        turtle only turns left\r
        * turtle move forward *then* turn left \r
        * turtle
        turn left *then* move forward?\r
        * something else? \r
        \r
        **Observe:** Once
        you've made a prediction, close these instructions and **run the program**
        to observe what happens.\r
        \r
        **Reflect:** Was your prediction correct?
        If not what about your mental model might need to change? Talk about it with
        a classmate and experiment with the code to make sure you understand what
        is happening.
      CSPU5_U313 drag Two Buttons_markdown_instruction: |
        # Buttons and Unique IDs\r
        You
        may have noticed that the button command has two parameters: `button(id, text)`.  The
        `text` is the text that actually shows up on the button display, and the `id`
        (we'll typically write **ID**) is a **unique identifier** for that element
        in the app.\r
        \r
        Each element that appears in the app must have a **unique
        ID**. In fact, if you try to run a program that has two buttons with same
        ID you will get a warning message in the console. Watch:\r
        <img src="https://images.code.org/47ec46e0563f63641cc10ef152e9f86e-image-1444074330713.gif"
        style="border: solid 1px black; width:500px">\r
        \r
        Notice that even though
        the text on the buttons was different, the IDs were the same, which caused
        the error message to show up. To get rid of that error message you will have
        to change the ID of the button from the default `id` to something else.\r
        \r
        **Error
        messages happen to everyone and they are helpful!**: getting an error or warning
        message when you run your program is *not a big deal*. Programmers actually
        rely on error messages to tell them where and how to fix their code.\r
        Sometimes
        error messages are bit cryptic: `WARNING: Line: 2: button() id parameter refers
        to an id (id) which already exists.` But a warning like this contains helpful
        information and clues such as the line the error occured on, or some word
        or command it didn't recognize. \r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        The goal here is to
        experience an error message in a program, study it, and fix it.\r
        * **Drag**
        two buttons into the workspace (same as shown above) with the default IDs.\r
        *
        **Run** the program to see the warning message in the console.\r
        * **Read**
        the warning message to see what it says.\r
        * **Change** the IDs of the buttons
        to make them unique. An ID must be specified in quotes. You can use double-quotes:
        `"myId"`, or single quotes: `'myId'`\r
        * **Re-run the program** to make
        sure you don't get the error.\r
        \r
        Once you've got two buttons on the
        screen with different IDs and the program can run without generating the warning,
        move on to the next level.\r

        # Other Ways to
        Assign Values to Variables\r
        Programs become much more interesting when the
        values in variables change while the program is running. We can also assign
        to a variable the value returned by a function. For example:\r
        \r
        ![](https://images.code.org/31447c1b90c925bba3ca86ead8d84a7d-image-1445892065474.png)\r
        \r
        Because
        the `randomNumber` function *evaluates to a number* it means we can treat
        it *as though it were a number*. We've used it before by just "plugging
        it in" to some function that needed a number as a parameter like:\r
        ![](https://images.code.org/5df0376d562bd75a1899e17c49b00144-image-1445941026356.png)\r
        \r
        Because
        the `randomNumber` function generates a new and different number each time
        you call it, one thing we *could not* do before we had variables was generate
        a random number, and use that *same number* for two different things in a
        program. Now we can.\r

        `promptNum` is similar to `randomNumber`
        in that it is a function whose return value *evaluates to a number*. The difference
        here is that `promptNum` pops up an input dialog box and waits for the user
        to type a number.  Once they do and hit "OK" the number they typed is returned

        # Variable Re-assignment
        - Part 2: Updating Values\r
        \r
        All of our examples so far have shown how
        to set the value of a variable by using combinations of numbers and other
        variables.  But what if you wanted to do something like **add 10 to the *current*
        value of a variable**? \r
        \r
        Because updating the value in a variable is
        just moving memory around, the process has to go something like this:\r
        *
        Read the current value of a variable.\r
        * Add 10 to it.\r
        * Store the new
        value back into the same variable.\r
        \r
        The technical term for this is called
        **variable re-assignment** - when you change the value of a variable based
        on its current contents.   To increase the value of `num1` by 10 you actually
        need to do this:\r
        \r
        <img src="https://images.code.org/c49b1a0fb81de4b90558fdb278e40987-image-1445942169121.png"
        style="float:right">\r
        ```\r
        num1 = num1 + 10;\r
        ```\r
        The diagram at
        right shows a picture of what's happening (it assumes the value of `num1`
        is 7 before the line is executed).  It's actually very similar to what happens
        with plain old arithmetic: compute a value, then store it in a variable.  Because
        the computation has to happen before storing the result in a variable, there
        is no contradiction here.\r

        & Tips</strong> [click to expand]</Summary>\r
        \r
        <h3>\r
        Mistake 1\r
        </h3>\r
        <p>To
        increase the value of variable by 10 (for example) a common mistake is to
        think that this statement alone will do the trick.\r
        </p><p>\r
        \r
        ```\r
        num1
        + 10;\r
        ```\r
        </p><p>\r
        It doesn't. This tells the computer to add 10
        to whatever the value of `num1` is.  And the computer will do that, and the
        result will go....nowhere.  It will be lost.\r
        </p><p>\r
        Because you are
        trying assign a new value to a variable it should make sense that **the =
        sign must be involved somehow**.  \r
        </p>\r
        <h3>\r
        Mistake 2\r
        </h3>\r
        <p>\r
        If
        you were in math class this statment would make no sense:\r
        ```\r
        num1 =
        num1 + 10;\r
        ```\r
        </p><p>\r
        But **remember to read = as "gets."** If
        you read the statement above as: "num1 *gets* the value of num1's current
        value plus 10" it might make more sense.  Get in the habit of using "gets."\r

        # Text and Variables
        Living Together!\r
        \r
        Sometimes it’s useful to display text along with the
        value of a variable in the same line of output. To do this you use `+` to
        attach a variable onto a literal string of characters.  Here is an example:\r
        \r
        <img
        src="https://images.code.org/a35e68b062fc814871a8323938cf3384-image-1445888147995.png"
        style="border: solid 1px #BBBBBB; height: 30px;">\r
        \r
        Notice that the
        `+` operator has **two different meanings in JavaScript depending on what
        type of data you're applying it to**. Click the explanations below for more
        details.\r
        \r
        <details>\r
        <summary>If **both operands are numbers** `+`
        means to add those two numbers together.</summary>\r
        \r
        This is standard
        addition.  It works both with numbers and with variables that contain numbers,
        as shown below.<br>\r
        \r
        <img src="https://images.code.org/eb50a1fcea459fe74774d903b07a274f-image-1445887814602.png"
        style="border: solid 1px #BBBBBB; height: 30px;"><br>\r
        \r
        Because `num1`
        is a variable that holds a number, and 10 itself is obviously a number, in
        this case `+` will do addition like you would expect.\r
        \r
        </details>\r
        <br>\r
        <details>\r
        <summary>If
        **either of the operands is a string** `+` treats both as if they were strings
        and combines them to create a single string.</summary>\r
        This is potentially
        confusing behavior and can get pretty weird if the text *looks* like numbers.  For
        example, this code will display **16100** to the screen.<br>\r
        \r
        <img src="https://images.code.org/a9c54b664bd192aa5bf611808d88a3bc-image-1445887893598.png"
        style="border: solid 1px #BBBBBB; height: 30px;"><br>\r
        \r
        Why? Because
        JavaScript sees you trying to display a mix of text and variable values. "16"
        (in quotes) is a string of ASCII characters not a number.  And so JavaScript
        converts everything to text, and the characters in the result of "16"+"100"
        comes out to "16100". \r
        \r
        </details>\r
        <br>\r
         \r
        **TIP:** It's
        common to want to sandwich a variable between some text when displaying it.  You
        can string together multiple pieces of text and variables using the `+` operator.  For
        example, you can do this:\r
        <br> \r
        \r
        <img src="https://images.code.org/65b0e277f058903bd3b956cc59ee5253-image-1445887976271.png"
        style="border: solid 1px #BBBBBB; height: 30px;"><br>\r

        <br>\r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**Misconception
        Alert**</summary>\r
        \r
        The **key thing to understand** about the `+` symbol
        is that it can _only_ do actual arithmetic addition if the values on either
        side of the `+` are actually numbers or variables that contain numbers. \r
        \r
        **And**
        if the `+` symbol cannot determine whether the value is a number then it **assumes
        it's a string**, and converts everything to a string and tries to concatenate
        it.  \r
         \r
        The computer relies on you - the programmer - to make sure that
        the **type of data** stored in a variable is appropriate for the task at hand.\r
        </details><br>\r
        \r
        On
        the next screen we'll have you play with this a little bit, but you'll write
        statements to display a mix of text and strings from here on out.\r
        \r
        #
        Do This:\r
        We have given you the starting code shown below.  You should **modify**
        the `write` statement on **line 3** to combine text and variables together

        # Add a
        Reset Button\r
        In most apps you want to provide a way to start over. \r
        \r
        To
        do this without having the user quit and restart your app, you need to add
        code to **reset variables and text displays to initial values** so the app
        can effectively start over.\r
        \r
        We've **added a button** to the "gameOverScreen"
        in the *Count Up/Down App* and **added an empty event handler** for it.  \r
        \r
        Right
        now clicking the "start over" button does nothing. You will write code to
        make it work.\r
        \r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        **Add code to the startOverButton event
        handler to reset the app**.  <img src="https://images.code.org/cb1569accb6a370d2258b5b14d624424-image-1446126849891.gif"
        style="width: 150px; float: right;">\r
        \r
        The app should work like the
        animation shown to the right. **Notice** that when the "start over" button
        is clicked it goes back to the main screen and  the count has been reset to
        0. \r
        \r
        The code should:\r
        \r
        * Set the screen to the gamePlayScreen.\r
        *
        Set the count variable to 0.\r
        * Set the correct text label on the gamePlayScreen
        to show the count is 0.\r
        \r
        Once you get it to work, move on.

        the **Count Up/Down App**.  Yes, it's a boring "game," but it has all the
        pieces of a more sophisticated game.\r
        \r
        This app demontrates a few new
        concepts.  We'll step through each one, one at a time, explaining how each
        thing works.  Along the way, we'll also encounter some common challenges,
        and learn how to solve them.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        * Keeping clicking the up
        arrow until something happens (something besides the number increasing).\r
        *
        Start over.\r
        * Click the down arrow until something happens (something besides
        the number decreasing).\r

        \r
        The *Count Up/Down App* has a bug! \r
        \r
        A ** common
        mistake** has been introduced into the code.\r
        \r

        <br><br>\r
        <strong><big>...forgetting
        to reset <i>everything</i> you need to actually start over.</big></strong><br><br>\r
        Frequently
        to actually reset you need to set a few variables back to initial values <i>and</i>
        update all the UI components, especially those that rely on those variables,
        so they reflect the new values.<br><br>\r
        \r
        Another common mistake shown
        here is setting the text of a label to "0" rather than the value of the
        count variable.  For example, these two lines of code are a little dangerous:<br><br>\r
        <pre>\r
        count
        = 0;\r
        setText("countDisplayLabel", 0);\r
        </pre>\r
        \r
        To be safe, if
        a label is supposed to display the value of a variable, you should always
        use the variable <i>instead of hard-coding numbers</i> as a check on yourself.  The
        general rule of thumb is: never hard-code a value instead of using a variable
        that holds the value you need to show.<br><br>\r
        \r
        <b>A common strategy</b>
        for handling this is to put everything you need to reset the app into a function
        which you can call at both the beginning of your program, and from other screens
        later on.  For example:<br><br>\r
        \r
        <pre>\r
        function resetAll(){\r
          count
        = 0;\r
          setText("countDisplayLabel", count);\r
          setScreen("gamePlayScreen");\r
        }\r
        </pre>\r
        \r
        Then
        in some other code like a button event handler you can just call your reset
        \r
        function:<br><br>\r
        \r
        <pre>\r
        onEvent("startOverButton", "click",
        \r
        function() {\r
          <span style="background-color:yellow">resetAll();</span>\r
        });\r
        </pre>\r

        This problem was probably easy to see here,
        but in practice <b>logic errors</b> like this can be devilish to track down.
        It's especially hard because the program gives you no hints that anything
        is wrong - it is syntactially a correct program. The computer cannot tell
        ahead of time whether your `if` statements will ever be true. So you need
        to trace through the logic of your program step by step to try to figure out
        why something's not happening that you expect should have happened.\r

        <strong><big>...using
        `=` instead of `==`</big></strong>\r
        <p>\r
        <b>Yup,</b> we told you this
        is a common mistake!  And it's an easy one to make.\r
        </p>\r
        <p>\r
        Remember
        that the single `=` sign does assignment and it actually *also* evaluates
        to true.  This means that if you stick it in an `if` statement, that `if`
        statement will <i>always</i> be true.\r
        </p>\r
        <p>\r
        One strategy to avoid
        this mistake is to **read code aloud in your head** and don't even use the
        single word "equal":\r
        <li> think **"gets"** every time you see `=`</li>\r
        <li>
        think **"equal-equal"** every time you see `==` </li>\r
        </p>\r
        <p>\r
        If
        you get in the habit of thinking that way, these mistakes are easier to catch.  For
        example you'd see this:<br>\r
        `if (count = 20)`<br>\r
        and read:<br>\r
        <i>"if
        count gets 20"</i> ...and know that that doesn't make sense.\r

        Misconception Alert - Changing a Variable Doesn't Change the Display</h1>\r
        \r
        A
        common misunderstanding about variables and displaying them is to think that
        a text label that's displaying a variable will change when the variable changes.
        NO.  A text label is just "dumb" container for text.  It's similar to a
        variable itself in that it won't change unless you explicitly tell it to.\r
        <p></p>\r
        <h1>Concept:
        Separation of Program Data from How It's Viewed</h1>\r
        Maintaining variables
        and program data is a **different task** from maintaining the display of the
        app.  Your program could actually run without updating the display at all
        - it would still be working behind the scenes; it just wouldn't be very fun
        or interesting to use.\r

        an important concept about using variables in apps.  Here is what you'll
        do:\r
        \r
        1. **Run this app, which works properly.**\r
         * Study the code
        until you think you understand what's happening.\r
         * Pay attention to the
        code that handles the up arrow being clicked.\r

        2. **Run the app on the
        next screen, which has a bug.**\r
         * On the next screen we show you almost
        the same app, but with a subtle problem.\r
         * See if you can spot the difference
        and fix it.\r
        \r

        # Importance of Double Quotes\r
        \r
        You
        may have noticed that the strings we've seen are **wrapped in double quotes**.
        These double quotes **are not part of the string**. Instead this is how you
        indicate that a sequence of characters **is a string and not the name of a
        variable**.\r
        \r
        As you start writing programs with strings **it is common
        to generate errors from forgetting to place them in double quotes**. We're
        going to generate some of those errors now so that we can recognize them more
        easily later.\r

        As
        we saw a user can now type inside of a text input whenever they want, **but
        now we'll need a way to access that text**. In order to do that you'll need
        to use the `getText` command, which you can now find in the **UI Controls**

        \r
        You can use a `getText` command just
        like a string within a `console.log` or `write` command. Just like with `setText`
        you will refer to the UI element by its ID.\r

        # How to Organize the
        Code\r
        As your apps get more complex you'll have to think about how to organize
        your code so it remains readable and easy for you to locate things when debugging
        any problems.  We suggest the following convention which breaks the code into
        3 major sections:\r
        * **Top**:  code for UI elements **and** any code for
        positioning them.\r
        * **Middle**: code for event handlers.\r
        * **Bottom**:
        code for any other other functions you've written. (We don't have any of
        these yet.)\r
        \r
        So if you have some existing code and want to insert a
        `setPosition` command, you should place it after `button` but before `onEvent`
        in the code, like this:\r
        \r
        <img src="https://images.code.org/ae17e62c077aa9698526371d22db1307-image-1448404255046.gif"

        style="float: right; width: 175px">\r
        \r
        * **Starter code** has been provided
        which creates two buttons and event handlers.\r
        * **Insert** `setPosition`
        commands for each button so they appear at the bottom of the screen (as shown).\r
          *
        **Remember:** in an app screen 0,0 is the top left corner and you specify
        a location by how many pixels from the left and how many down from the top
        of the screen it is.  The screen is **320 by 450 pixels**.

        # Strings\r
        \r
        The primary
        data type we have used so far is **Numbers**. If we want to interact with
        user-submitted text, however, we'll need to learn about a new data type called
        a **String**.  A string is a **sequence of ASCII characters**.\r
        \r
        **Example**
        | **Rule**\r
        ---|---\r
        `"aString"` | Strings **might** look a lot like
        a variable name but there are **many differences**.\r
        `"look at all these
        spaces"` | Strings can **contain spaces**.\r
        `"$2 bills are the coolest"`
        | Strings can **contain special characters** (and even start with them).\r
        `"11"`
        | Strings might **contain only digits**. This looks like a number but it is
        really 2 ASCII characters.\r
        `""` | Strings might **contain no characters**.\r
        <br>\r
        You
        can **store strings in a variable just like a number**. In this example the
        variable name is `str` but you should choose a name that is **descriptive
        and meaningful**.\r
        \r
        ![](https://images.code.org/56e6b30a51556aa3b516e0a49b51cbeb-image-1445894334432.18.40

        \r
        **Combining Strings:** often you will want to combine multiple
        strings to create one longer string. You can do this with the `+` operator.
        The formal name of this process is **concatenation**.\r
        \r
        The program you're
        about to see is a very simple Mad Libs app that uses strings that are created
        inside the program and  saved inside of variables. These strings are then
        **concatenated** with other strings to create a Mad Lib.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        *
        The input words of this Mad Lib are **currently set to the empty string**.\r
        *
        **Add your own input words** and run the program to generate the Mad Lib.

        that capture keystroke events. These are interesting, but they do not work

        far we've been outputting our messages to the console, but now we'd like
        to display them in the app. In order to do so we're going to be using a new

        elements that users can use to submit text (i.e. strings) instead**. The first
        and simplest example is `textInput` which you can find in Design Mode.\r

        the user.\r
        * **Give your text input elements descriptive and meaningful
        IDs**.\r
        * **In Design Mode** set their default text to prompt the user for
        their name and age.\r

        Note that the syntax is similar to `console.log` . This is
        because `toUpperCase` really only makes sense as a command when you are using
        a **string**, just as `log` only makes sense when you are talking about the
        console. This function **evaluates to a new string in which all characters
        have been made uppercase / lowercase**. If you want to update the value in
        your original variable you'll have to do so explicitly, as in\r
        \r
        ```\r
        var
        myString = "lower case for now";\r

        Up
        until now, the event-driven apps you have created responded to the user clicking
        an element or typing a number when you used `promptNum`. __What if we want
        the user to provide _text_ instead of a number?__ You can probably think of
        many apps and websites that ask you to provide text in order to do something.\r
        \r
        In
        programming, we have to represent text in a specific way to distinguish it
        from other words in our code, such as variable names. But we'll cover that
        later...\r
        \r
        At the beginning of class you created a Mad Libs on paper,
        which takes user input in the form of nouns, adjectives, and verbs to create
        a unique "How-to" manual. You'll be translating your own Mad Libs How-to
        into an app in this lesson.\r

        __Screen

        \r
        __Screen 2: View Mad Libs__  \r
        - On this screen,
        you'll use the __text area__ design element to create the space where the

        it's called a *variable* for a reason - its value can change (or vary) throughout
        a program. This is useful and necessary for keeping track of things like a
        score in a game.\r
        \r
        To re-assign a value to a variable all you have to
        do is maintain the mental model of what's happening:\r
        \r
         * Variables
        are containers for information.\r
         * The `=` sign is an instruction to set
        the value.\r
         * A series of assignment statements (see example to right)
        is a list of instructions to execute one at a time - it's not a series of
        equations that define the state of the world.\r
        \r

        style="float: right">\r
        \r
         * **Make a prediction.**\r
        \r
         The code
        on the following screen looks like what is shown at right.  Study it and make
        a prediction about what will happen when you run the code. What will the values
        of `a` and `b` be at the end of the program?\r
        \r
        * **Add `console.log`
        statements.** \r
        \r
         Prove it to yourself by adding `console.log` statements
        at the end of the program to find out what the value of `a` and  `b` are.\r

        \r
        * **NOTICE:** in the code above, after the variable `a` has been created
        using `var`, to change a variable's value, you only need to refer to the
        variable by its name. The word `var` only needs to be used once - when the
        variable is created for the first time. \r
        \r
        * It's a **common mistake**
        to use `var` everytime you want to *use* a variable but just **remember `var`
        means CREATE a new variable**.  When you create a new variable it will lose
        its old value.  We'll look at errors related to this later.\r

        Let's get started with the most basic example of using and controlling
        the computer's memory with variables. The toolbox has a couple of new commands
        for working with variables.\r
        \r

        <li> **Assigns** the value *0* to `score`</li>\r
        <li>**Displays**
        the value of the `score` to the console (see hint below about quotes) </li>\r

        # Do This:\r
        You're
        going to add another variable, assign it a value, and then display it to the
        console.\r
        Use the starting code as a model for what you need to create now.\r

        `x` to `lives` (see animation at right).\r

        Wrapping Up Variables - This is Not Math Class\r
        \r
        Hopefully you now understand
        the gist of working with variables.  The major thing to remember is that every
        time you see an `=` sign it means that you are instructing the computer to
        set a variable to a new value.  \r
        \r

        The example to the right is something that definitely
        wouldn't make sense in math class, but you should be able to reason about
        it as a piece of code.  Because it's code, you can also **insert** statements
        to display the value of variables as they change.  You don't have to guess!\r
        \r
        #
        Do This:\r
        * ** Make a prediction.** \r
        \r
         As usual you should **first**
        look at the code given to you and reason about what it does.  You should try
        to predict what the value of `num` will be after all lines have executed.\r
        \r
        *
        ** Insert 3 `console.log` statements.**\r
        \r
         Insert `console.log` statements
        into the existing code to display each value of `num` immediately after it's
        changed. (The animation below shows how to get started.)\r

         \r

        debug another problem only using `write` instead of `console.log`.  \r
        \r
        You
        may have already run into this problem!  But it's worth mentioning again.
        To display the value of a variable you *should not* use quotes. Notice the

        with the same message no matter what the user types. Let's look at how to
        make the digital assistant smarter. Let's work on creating a Movie Bot example
        before returning to your digital assistant.\r

        In the digital assistant we want to make decisions based on keywords. **The
        first keywords we want the Movie Bot to respond to are the movie genres: comedy,
        romance, action, and horror. **\r

        \r
        * **Add `else-if` statements**
        to the `if` to check if the word the user typed matches **action, romance
        and horror**.  **Note:** Movie Bot will only understand input in the form
        of "comedy" not "Comedy" or "What is a comedy?" \r

        We're going to explore
        a new function called `includes`. This function can be used to check if one

        this function is called using **dot notation**.\r
        \r
        # *includes* Returns
        a Boolean\r
        **`includes` is a function that returns a boolean.** In other
        words, when the function runs it will **evaulate to either `true` or `false`**.
        This function can be used **anywhere you would normally use a boolean expression**.\r
        \r
        You've
        actually **seen a few functions that return a value before this**. `randomNumber`
        is a function that returns a number and `getText` is a function that returns
        a string. In every case we've used these functions **as if they were the
        data type they return (or evaulate to)**. Notice that in block mode these
        functions don't have the connectors that other commands do since they will
        be used as a piece of data within another function.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        *
        **Read the documentation** for `includes`.\r
        * **Starter code** has been
        provided which shows one instance where a string does include a `searchValue`
        and one where it does not.\r
        * **Replicate the style** of these commands
        to check the rest of questions provided.\r
        * **Create three statements of
        your own using `includes`** making use of the `console.log` statements provided.\r

        If

        events work in App Lab. To start let's take a closer look at the `onEvent`
        block. We already know that event handlers call a function. What we'll see
        now is that they also **pass a parameter**. The default name for this parameter
        is simply `event` but you can change it to be anything you like. \r
        \r
        The
        `event` parameter is a more complex kind of variable (called an "Object")
        that we'll learn more about later. For now just know that for both mouse
        and keyboard events, the event parameter passes more information about the
        event. In the case of key events **you can find out the key(s) that were actually
        pressed by using `event.key`**.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r

        \r
        You may have noticed from the last couple of levels that the value
        of `event.key` is just a string which is the name of the key. As a result
        we can check which key was pressed with a simple conditional statement.  For
        example to check for the press of the **"a"** key we could write `if (event.key
        == "a")`.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        The **starter code provided** plays the sound
        whenever ANY key is pressed.\r
        \r
        * Use `console.log` to **find out the
        value of `event.key` when the up arrow is pressed.**\r
        \r
        * **Add an `if`
        statement** so the sound only plays when the when the **up arrow** is pressed.

        On
        the last level you may have noticed that if you typed in a question like "What
        is an R rated comedy movie?" It gives two movie suggestions! It would make
        more sense for it to give one suggestion.\r
        \r
        We could use nested `if`
        statements to do this by nesting `if` statements about ratings inside of `if`
        statements about genre. However, you might be getting a sinking feeling that
        this could become a lot of nested `if` statements very quickly! \r
        \r
        **Instead
        let's use the AND operator (`&&`) to check for a genre and a rating at the
        same time.** \r
        \r
        <img src="https://images.code.org/a9307ead3b147e0a8016f2054f47f5f2-image-1446153610104.png"
        style="width: 200px; float:right">\r
        \r
        Be careful about the order of
        the `if` statements. As a general principle you want to check the most specific
        conditions before checking more general ones.  For example, you want to have
        an `if` statement that checks for rating AND genre evaluated before one that
        just checks for genre on its own. Having a more general `if` statement checked
        first might cut off or prevent more specific conditions from being reached.\r
        \r
        You
        still want your app to give suggestions when just a rating or just a genre
        is detected, so keep this principle of ordering in mind. (Try them in the
        reverse order if you're interested in seeing what happens :))\r

        Hmmm, those shapes are
        getting bigger every time! Didn't we already solve this problem with variables?
        How can we use the counter variable to make the sides smaller as there are
        more of them? Instead of moving forward by a set amount, try moving forward
        (100 / counter) pixels.

        ### Make a list of Problem Solving Strategies

        We have
        all learned different problem solving strategies through out our lives. Some
        work all the time and others only in certain situations. Make a list of all
        the problem solving strategies you can think of. You will continue to add
        to this list over the course of this unit PD. You can also share strategies
        or find new strategies on the forum.

        and your students will need for the current lesson. Then add to the list if
        you think of new things.**

      Escape Room Example_markdown_instruction: |-
        # Room Escape\r
        \r
        In today's
        workshop you are going to be working on making a room escape app!  This level
        has an example app that you should play around with to get the feel for what
        you will be creating.\r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        \r
        * Click RUN to start the app\r
        *
        Try to find the key that will open the door.
      Eval Booleans 1_markdown_instruction: |-
        Boolean operators (like >, <, =) allow
        us to compare different values, returning either *true* or *false*. Click
        "Run" to see how this expression evaluates.
      Eval Booleans 2_markdown_instruction: |-
        Can you set the values so that this
        expression evaluates as *true*?
      Eval Booleans 3_markdown_instruction: |-
        The `string-length` function returns
        the number of characters in a string (including spaces!) - make this code
        evaluate to *true*.
      Eval Booleans 4_markdown_instruction: |-
        Here's an Evaluation Block called `and`
        - it returns *true* if both of its parameters are *true*, otherwise it returns
        *false*. Edit the x variable so that this expression returns *true*.
      Eval Booleans 5_markdown_instruction: |-
        This `or` block returns *true* if either
        of its parameters is *true*. Otherwise, if both parameters are *false* it
        will return *false*. Set the y variable to a value that will cause this expression
        to return *false*.
      Eval Booleans 6_markdown_instruction: |-
        Here's one more boolean block called
        `not`. This block flips *true* to *false*, or *false* to *true*. If you wrap
        this block of code in a NOT block, it should return *true* (because we are
        asking if the two expressions do NOT produce equal values).
      Eval Booleans Free Play_markdown_instruction: |-
        Free Play: Try out some creations
        of your own using Booleans.
      Eval Cond 4_markdown_instruction: |-
        We can use the `string=?` function to make
        conditionals that respond to text input. Here's a function called `green
        shape` that takes a string for the type of shape. Complete the conditions
        so that the correct solid green shape is returned when the function is run
        with "circle", "triangle", "square", or "rectangle".
      Eval Cond 5_markdown_instruction: |-
        Here's a similar function `red shape` with
        an additional variable for size. Complete the conditionals so the correct
        solid red image of a given size is drawn for "circle", "triangle", and
        "star".
      Eval Contracts 4_markdown_instruction: |-
        The `scale` function returns an image
        that is either larger or smaller than the input image. Try scaling this circle
        by a factor of 10. How is the returned image different than if you'd just
        made a circle of that size in the first place?
      Eval Contracts A_markdown_instruction: |-
        Use the `star` function to produce
        a solid red star with a 60 pixel radius
      Eval Contracts C_markdown_instruction: |-
        Check out the `rotate` function - can
        you use it to rotate this 90 pixel green square by 45 degrees?
      Eval Contracts E_markdown_instruction: |-
        Try using the `text` function to write
        this "Hello, world!" in teal at size 40.
      Eval Define Funcs 1_markdown_instruction: |-
        Here's a new function called `green-triangle`
        that takes a single Number for size and produces a green triangle. Use the
        new function to create a 125 pixel green triangle
      Eval Define Funcs 2_markdown_instruction: |-
        Let's look inside that `green-triangle`
        function to see how it works. Can you modify it so that the `green-triangle`
        function always draws outlined green triangles? **Don't forget to change
        the examples too!**
      Eval Define Funcs 3_markdown_instruction: |-
        Here's the start of another new
        function called `purple-circle` with a domain of one Number (the radius) and
        a range of Image. The body of the function is broken though, it always draws
        a circle of 50 pixel radius instead of using the radius parameter. Replace
        the current Number with the `radius` block from the domain.\r
        \r
        When you've
        fixed the function, test your new function with a 150 pixel radius.
      Eval Define Funcs 4_markdown_instruction: |-
        Create a new function called `aqua-star`
        that has a Domain of a single Number for radius and returns an aqua star of
        the given radius. Run your new function with a radius of 75.
      Eval Define Funcs 5_markdown_instruction: |-
        Let's use that `aqua-star` function
        to make a row of different sized stars. From left to right, the stars should
        have radii of 25, 50, and 75.
      Eval Define Funcs Test_markdown_instruction: |-
        Here's the start of another
        new function called `purple-circle` with a domain of one Number (the radius)
        and a range of Image. The body of the function is broken though, it always
        draws a circle of 50 pixel radius instead of using the radius parameter. Replace
        the current Number with the `radius` block from the domain.\r
        \r
        When you've
        fixed the function, test your new function with a 150 pixel radius.
      Eval Defining Vars Free Play 1_markdown_instruction: |-
        Free Play: We've provided
        a function that fills your screen with `my-image`. Change `my-image` to see
        what patterns you can make.
      Eval Design Recipe .1_markdown_instruction: |-
        Here's a Design Recipe for a
        function called `square-circle` with domain Number String and range Image.
        Click Edit to write the function definition (you will see two examples provided).
      Eval Design Recipe 3_markdown_instruction: |-
        The Design Recipe for `wide-rect`
        already has a contract and one example. Can you write a second example and
        then complete the definition? The `wide-rect` function should produce a rectangle
        of given color that is twice as wide as it is high.
      Eval Design Recipe 4_markdown_instruction: |-
        Use the Design Recipe to create
        a function `starburst`. When given a number of points and an outer radius,
        `starburst` returns a yellow radial star with given points, and an inner radius
        that is half the outer radius.
      Eval Design Recipe 5_markdown_instruction: |-
        Write a function `striped-flag`
        that takes two colors and produces a flag that is 250 pixels wide, 150 pixels
        tall, with three even horizontal stripes of given colors, in the order color2,
        color1, color2.
      Eval Design Recipe 6_markdown_instruction: |-
        Write a function `large-polygon`
        that should output a solid polygon of given sides and color that takes up
        most of the window, regardless of the number of sides. To make sure that the
        polygon doesn't get too large as you increase the number of sides, side length
        should be inversely proportional to side number, with a length of **(800/sides)**.
      Eval Design Recipe Free Play_markdown_instruction: |-
        Free Play: Use the Design
        Recipe to create some functions of your own design
      Eval Strings Images .1_markdown_instruction: |-
        So far we've only dealt with
        a single type of data, Numbers. Another type of data is a String, which is
        any combination of letters, numbers, or other characters wrapped in quotation
        marks. Run the String "Hello, world!" and see what happens.
      Eval Strings Images .2_markdown_instruction: |-
        The `string-append` function
        takes two Strings and returns a single combined String. Add a String "Universe"
        to the second argument of `string-append`.
      Eval Strings Images 1_markdown_instruction: |-
        The third type of data we're
        going to use is an Image. This `star` function takes in a Number and two Strings,
        and it evaluates to an Image. Use this function to make a solid red star with
        radius of 100.
      Eval Strings Images 2_markdown_instruction: |-
        Free Play: Every Evaluation Block
        is color-coded to let you know which data type it returns and which types
        it needs for its parameters. The last parameter of the triangle function takes
        a String that controls its color - try some different colors to see what works.
      Eval Strings Images 3_markdown_instruction: |-
        Some functions can only take a
        specific set of Strings, such as the second argument of this `circle` function,
        which controls its style. Draw this orange outline circle using the special
        String block with a dropdown to make sure you only use valid styles.
      Eval Strings Images 4_markdown_instruction: |-
        Try using the `rectangle` block
        to draw this solid, red rectangle - it is 175 pixels wide and 100 pixels tall.
      Eval Strings Images 5_markdown_instruction: |-
        Try using this new Evaluation

        **Now You Try it** - add an image to your app
        and modify the code so that the image jumps around the screen rather than
        the button.  Your little game should have:\r
        \r
        * **Text** on the top of
        the screen with a title or instructions for what to do.\r
        * **An image**
        that "runs away" (moves randomly) based on some mouse event.\r
        \r
        **Tips:**\r

        * **Hint** - the easy way to do this is to simply change the IDs in `onEvent`
        and `setPosition` to respond to the image instead of the button.\r
         * Remove
        the button from the app after the image is working.  We don't need it anymore.\r

        * Change the label text so that the instructions make sense for your game.\r

        * The game is even more fun if you use  the `mouseover` event instead of `click`\r

        **Optional
        Extensions**:\r
         * Make the background interesting\r
         * Add another image
        that runs away.\r
         * See what happens with the commands `hideElement` and
        `showElement`\r

        # Break a random substitution cipher!\r
        \r
        Messages
        encrypted with the **Caesar cipher** are very easy to crack. What if instead
        of shifting the whole alphabet, we mapped every letter of the alphabet to
        a random different letter of the alphabet? This is called a **random substitution
        cipher**.\r
        \r
        In this version of the tool, you'll be interacting more
        with the graphs that show letter frequency. By analyzing the frequency of
        the letters in the encrypted input message compared to the frequency of letters
        in a typical piece of English prose, you can start to narrow in on what some
        of the letter mappings might be. Did you know that *'E'* is the most common
        letter used in the English language? Maybe the most common letter in your
        encrypted text maps to the letter *'E'*, but maybe not! You'll have to
        do a bit of guess and check to see if that substitution makes sense.\r
        \r
        \r
        #
        Do this\r
        - Load the **Sample message (hard)** from the message dropdown.
        This will load a message that has been encrypted with a random substitution
        cipher.  \r
        ![](https://images.code.org/04c6230c9607110126581c298bc09183-image-1443569176380.gif)\r
        \r
        -
        You will crack the message by guessing what each letter of the alphabet contained
        in the original ciphertext should be changed to. You can do so by dragging
        the blue letters of the alphabet directly underneath the orange letter you
        want changed in the original ciphertext. Letters that have been changed using
        your guesses will no longer be highlighted orange in the message window on
        the left.\r

        \r
        -
        Play with some of the sorting options available in the Random substitution
        cipher tab to get different views on the letter frequencies in the input text
        as well as standard English text.\r

        # Randomized Shapes\r
        \r
        Let's
        see how we can use randomization in our drawings. Each of the inputs from
        the shape blocks you've seen can be replaced with calls to `randomNumber()`.
        Try drawing some images that are slightly randomized each time. You might
        try changing the position randomly by using `randomNumber()` in place of the
        x or y inputs, or you could change the size of the shape itself by randomizing
        the length or width inputs.\r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        \r
        Pick a shape command (`ellipse()`,
        `rect()` or `regularPolygon()`) and use `randomNumber()` in place of one or
        more of the inputs. Make sure you run it a few times so you can see the effect
        of randomization.\r

        a drawing to your partners using only bits.\r
        \r
        **Challenge Rules:**\r
        The
        image will be a line drawing created by connecting points on a grid, like
        the one seen here.\r

        ## Sending Formatted
        Text Activity\r
        \r
        **Directions:**  \r
        Work with a partner or in a small
        team to develop a protocol that allows you to send formatted text. \r
        \r
        **Guidelines:**  \r
        -
        Both the text and the formatting instructions must be derived from the printable
        ASCII character set (i.e. codes 32-126).\r
        - Your protocol must encode at
        least:\r
        \t- bold, italics, and underlining\r
        \t- three different font sizes
        (large, medium, and small)\r
        \t- three different font colors (red, black,
        blue)\r
        - You will demonstrate that your protocol works by having the recipient
        be able to faithfully draw (or produce in some fashion) the formatted text
        based only on the data she received through an ASCII-text version of the Internet
        Simulator. A sample message can be found below.\r

        * An IF statement can have an else clause, but
        an ELSE clause cannot exist on its own.\r
        * With an else clause you are *guaranteeing*

        ###
        Points to pay attention to:\r
        \r
        1. What's a *Boolean Expression?*\r
        2.
        Why is it called a "Boolean"?\r
        3. Is this a legal expression?  `10 > 25`?
      'Introduction to Conditionals: Compound Boolean Expressions_markdown_instruction': |
        ###
        Points to pay attention to:\r
        \r
        * The "Boolean operators" are AND and
        OR.  \r
        * In JavaScript you write them as `&&` for AND and `||` for OR.\r
        *
        You use them to combine boolean expressions into a single statement when you
        need to check multiple conditions before executing a particular segment of
        code.\r

        ###
        Points to pay attention to:\r
        \r
        * An if-else-if statement lets you check
        more than one condition at a time.\r
        * The **order of conditions matters**.
        Since conditions are checked sequentially from top to bottom, the code that
        gets executed will be the *first* statement to evaluate to true.\r

        that you have a better sense of this lessons in this sequence, let’s think
        about the types of supports students will need in order to be successful.
        Since the curriculum is based on inquiry learning, lessons feature activities
        that engage students in discovering core concepts themselves. It’s important
        to think through implementation plans and student support. In this task you
        will make a plan for teaching and student support **for one of the lessons
        in this sequence** that takes into account differentiation strategies and
        make-up work for absent students. Your teaching and student support plan should
        cover the following: \r
        \r
        \r
        - **Which lesson in the sequence are you
        discussing?** \r
        \r
        - **Details on how you will implement and differentiate
        the lesson:**\r
        \r
         - An outline of any changes you will need to make to
        the lesson to fit your local constraints or context (for example: pacing and
        time, dealing with classroom setup, etc). \r
         - An overview of the types
        of student needs you’ll likely need to support in your classroom (for example:
        students who are struggling to understand the underlying concept; students
        who are already familiar with the concept, but still have room to learn more;
        etc)\r
         - Your plan for addressing each of the needs outlined above (for
        example: integrating extension activities or other materials for students
        who already know something about the topic)\r
         - How will you address or
        emphasize the connection between lessons in this sequence? \r
        \r
        <br>\r
        -
        **Plan for catching up absent students:**\r
        \r
         - How will absent students
        catch up on activities they missed? \r
         - How will you use the fact that
        the lessons in this sequence are related and build on one another to address
        make-up work? \r
        \r
        You can type out your teaching and student support plan
        in the box below, or you can upload a word doc or pdf file. \r

        # Modular Arithmetic\r
        \r
        \r
        The
        modulo operation (which gives you the remainder of dividing two integers)
        is important in computer science and it turns out to be useful in many contexts
        including encryption. It’s actually not computationally intensive to compute
        a single modulo on a computer; it’s as fast as dividing two numbers. The commutative
        properties of modulo and numbers with large exponents were discovered to be
        the key ingredients for modern day asymmetric encryption.\r
        \r
        \r
        The link
        below introduces the concept of modular arithmetic, and explains the Diffie-Hellman
        key exchange (described in lesson 7 using an analogy with Alice, Eve, and
        Bob).

        # Lesson Prep > Thinking on Paper\r
        \r
        As
        you learned in the summer PD, thinking through the Design Recipe on paper
        is an essential step for success, particularly when it comes to solving complex
        or novel problems. Print out a copy of the [Design Recipe worksheet](https://code.org/curriculum/docs/algebra/worksheets/design_recipe.pdf)
        and go through your chosen word problem as if you were a student.\r
        \r
        ##
        Put on your student hat\r
        \r
        Viewing these problems as your students will
        can help you identify potential pain points, lack of clarity, or misconceptions.
        It's sometimes difficult to drop our teacher assumptions and expectations,
        but the more authentically you can wear your student hat, the more you will
        learn about the possible difficulties in your plan.\r
        \r
        ## What's tough
        about this problem?\r
        \r
        After you complete your Design Recipe on paper,
        think about the difficult elements of your particular word problem. Where
        might students stumble, and what can you do to support them in that struggle?
        The goal here is not necessarily to remove the struggle (as that's where
        we learn the most), but to prepare for it.
      PDAlg Updates Cond_markdown_instruction: |-
        When you went to PD in the summer,
        the **Conditional** block that you were introduced to was black and allowed

        function we've seen always produces the same type of data. To help make conditionals
        clearer and more consistent we've replaced the single black block with a
        separate block for each data type.\r

        Few things in programming are as

      PDAlg Updates Space_markdown_instruction: |-
        Making use of limited programming
        space (especially on small screens) is challenging with a block based language.
        To help with this we've added a few features:\r
        \r
        - A draggable bar (three
        vertical dots) between the programming space and the game space allowing you
        to shrink the game space for more room to code.\r
        - A handful of redesigned
        blocks that take up less horizontal space (check out the new `overlay` block.)\r
        -
        The programming space will scroll vertically when the blocks extend past the
        visible screen space.\r
        - Zoom in and out using Cmd +/- (Mac) or Ctrl +/-
        (Windows)\r
        \r
        Experiment with this provided code to see how the space can

      PDK5 Course Descriptions_markdown_instruction: |
        The courses use a spiraling
        curriculum design, in which concepts and skills are revisited in each course
        while delving deeper each time.

        Each course experience is a blend of online
        activities and "unplugged" activities, which are lessons where students
        learn computing concepts without a computer. The online experiences are composed
        of self-guided and self-paced tutorials, which use scaffolded sets of programming
        instructions to explore and practice algorithmic thinking. The unplugged lessons
        take a hands-on, often kinesthetic approach, making use of physical manipulatives
        to model computational concepts.

        Each course consists of about 18 to 20
        lessons, each lasting between 25 and 45 minutes. They can be taught at a comfortable
        pace whether in consecutive days as a sub-unit or one day a week for 18 weeks.
        The content of each course builds conceptually on the previous course, so
        that a student can progress through all three experiences learning new concepts
        along the way.

        Code.org's K-5 curriculum aligns to CSTA Computer Science
        Standards and ISTE standards, while some lessons also integrate national Math,
        English Language Arts, and Science standards.

        Across the entire K-5 curriculum,
        the use of *Computer Science Themes* scaffolds the development of ideas and
        recognizes the continual construction of knowledge:

        - Algorithms
        - Data
        -
        Abstraction
        - Computing Practice and Programming (Use of computational tools)
        -
        Computers and Communication Devices (Elements of computing devices and networks)
        -
        Community, Global, and Ethical Impacts

        Across the entire K-5 curriculum,
        students will develop the skills of a computer scientist through the development
        of *Computational Thinking Practices*:

        - Creativity
        - Collaboration
        -
        Communication
        - Persistence
        - Problem Solving

        ### Concepts Learned in
        each Course

        By the end of **Course 1**, students will learn the following
        computer science concepts:

        - Sequence
        - Loops
        - Events
        - Debugging
        -
        Internet safety

        By the end of **Course 2**, students will learn the following
        computer science concepts:

        - Sequence
        - Loops and nested loops
        - Conditionals
        -
        Introductory binary
        - Events
        - Debugging
        - Internet safety

        By the end
        of **Course 3**, *which has a pre-requisite of Course 2*, students will learn
        the following computer science concepts:

        - Steps of computational thinking
        -
        Using and creating functions
        - Nested conditionals
        - While loops
        - Crowdsourcing
        -
        Methods of Internet data transmission
        - Digital Citizenship

        ** Template **\r
        \r
        This level
        is a template for the app. You should **run it to see what it does** right
        now. You will modify *this* template, both the design elements and the code,
        for your project.\r
        \r
        The template has 4 screens and some basic navigation
        functionality and event handlers set up for you.  The game play screen uses
        the images from the Apple Grabber game, but you should replace these with
        images related to your chosen theme.\r

      Project - Your Own Multi Screen App_markdown_instruction: |-
        # Multi Screen App\r
        You
        will be creating your own multi-screen app to practice designing user interfaces
        and writing event-driven programs. \r
        \r
        **Look at the Project Guide and
        Planning Sheets before programming**.\r
        \r
        # NOTE: Bigger toolbox\r
        \r
        *
        You may notice that we've included all of the commands you know so far in
        the coding toolbox **plus a few more**\r
        * Remember you can hover over a
        command to see documentation for it.\r
        * You can also just try it out to
        see what it does.\r
        \r
        # Requirements Reminder\r
        * Your app must have a
        purpose\r
        * Your app will have at least **4 screens**.\r
        * Your app should
        include **text, images, buttons, and sound**.\r
        * There should be **no “getting
        stuck” on any screen.**  It should always be possible to navigate from a screen
        in your app to some other screen. \r
        * Your program code should follow **good
        style**.\r
        * Your user interface should be **intuitive to use**.

        # Challenge - Pick a
        way for the game to end and implement it\r
        \r
        Your challenge now is to add
        some code completely on your own.  Use what you've learned so far, and Alexis
        and Michael's discussion to help you.\r
        \r
        **This is the last programming
        level**\r
        \r
        * Make all changes and additions to the program that you want
        here\r
        * When you're done hit **Submit**\r
        \r
        **Goal:** Add code that
        provides a way for the game to end which:\r
        * Switches to the `gameOver_screen`\r
        *
        Shows which player won the game by showing `player1Win_label` or `player2Win_label`\r
        \r
        *We've
        provided `gameOver_screen` as part of the template for this project -- Switch
        to Design Mode to take a look at what's there*\r
        \r
        **Suggestions**\r
        *
        If you're stuck for ideas, try to implement the end game condition of "first
        to 10" - first player to reach a score of 10 wins.\r
        * You should use the
        suggestion from the discussion to add a function like `checkGameOver()` and
        call it from `checkCorrect`\r

        \r
        <li>Add

        go back to the game play screen\r
        </li>\r
        <li>Add a welcome screen that
        explains the rules and invites the player to start the game (make it the default
        screen)\r
        </li>\r
        <li>Make the game more difficult:</li>\r
        <uL>\r
        <li>Make
        the colors more similar (we added 20 to every RGB value, try 15 or 10).</li>\r
            <li>Or
        make the difficulty variable - you can generate a random number between 5
        and 20 and add that to the RGB values. </li>\r
            <li>Or make it get progressively
        more difficult - use a variable to keep track of how much to add to each RGB
        value and decrease it over time.</li>\r
        \t<li>Or on a welcome screen ask
        if the player wants to play easy, medium, or hard.</li>\r
        </uL>\r
        \r
        <li>Add
        a timing element - lookup the documentation for setTimeout which calls a function
        after a certain amount of time. (Note: you may need to remix the project in
        as a free-play App Lab project to do this).\r
        </li>\r
        <li>You can also use
        <code>getTime()</code> at the beginning and end of your code to figure out
        how long it took for the game to end, which you could use to adjust the score.</li>\r

        ## Do the Activity\r
        \r
        One of the best ways to prepare
        to teach a lesson is by actually doing the activity yourself.  As you complete
        the activity, consider the misconceptions that your students may have and
        what sorts of questions you can ask to help them overcome these barriers.  \r
        Notes:\r
        <ol>\r
        <li>There
        are many 'correct' answers to this activity. The important part is that
        rules are applied consistently. </li>\r
        <li> The difficult part of this task
        is not to find all of the shapes, but to create an ordering that does not
        ever repeat a pattern and articulating that ordering as a set of rules or
        a protocol. </li></ol>\r

        and then use those parts as building blocks to make this more complex drawing.\r
        \r
        *
        First let's **define** a function that *draws just one of these zig-zag steps.*  We've
        started you out with a definition of `right()` that you can use...\r

        use four subgoals for this. First, you'll **define a function** (`//Define

        **orienting the turtle** (`//Orient turtle`). Last, don't forget to **call

        \r
        **Remember**
        typically, you call a function in lines of code *above* the function definition
        - this might make you  feel like you are working in reverse, since you first
        write the code to define the function and *then* add a line to call it.  Here
        is the `moveTwice` example from the video. You should do something similar

        You'll
        use four subgoals to solve this problem (sort of). First you'll `//Define
        function`, which will include `//Orient turtle`. As you will start to see,
        even subgoals can be broken down into subgoals sometimes. This will be helpful
        when you start creating more complex functions. \r

        just wrote this function, we've already **defined** `turnAround()` for you.
        \r
        \r
        Remember, add lines of code that call the function *above* the definition.
        The function definition is after the function call to support **abstraction**.
        If you don't need to know how the function works inside, you never have to
        look at it, you can just call it.\r
        \r
        *NOTE: the turtle should end where
        it started, which is also the middle of the plus sign, as shown below. Each

        In
        the end you will have 4 functions defined:\r
        \r
        * drawDiamond()\r
        * drawSide()\r
        *
        drawStep()\r
        * right()\r
        \r
        These 4 functions work sort of like a hierarchy
        of top-down design.  At the top is `drawDiamond()` which makes calls to `drawSide()`,
        which makes calls to `drawStep()` and `right()`.\r
        \r
        For most programming
        problems that you face, the problem won't be broken down into pieces like
        it was for this series of puzzles. You'll have to figure out your own hierarchy
        of functions based on which patterns you want to use multiple times. This
        is why planning your solution ahead of time can make your code more efficient.
        \r
        \r
        Subgoals will help you do this. Once you recognize that the diamond
        can be drawn using the same function repeated 4 times, you can note with a
        subgoal comment that you'll need to define and call a function for `drawSide()`.
        Then you can figure out that one side can be drawn using the same function
        3 times plus a couple of steps, you can make note to define and call `drawStep()`.
        Once you've planned the solution, you can fill in blocks to complete it.

        # A New Way to Move
        the Turtle\r
        The `moveForward()` turtle command that we've used so far moves
        the turtle the same amount every time (25 pixels in fact). Similarly, `turnLeft()`
        turns the turtle to the left exactly 90 degrees. Today we are going to see
        how some functions can **accept input**, such as a number, to be used more
        flexibly. For example, you can write `moveForward(103)` to move the turtle
        forward exactly 103 pixels if you like.\r

        version of `moveForward()` in action. Then **changing only the number supplied
        to `moveForward()`**, move the turtle to the top edge of the screen. Experiment
        to find out the distance in pixels between where the turtle starts and the
        top edge of the screen.\r

        \r
        When
        you have a command like: `moveForward(100)` we say that the `moveForward()`
        command *accepts a **parameter***.  And 100 is the value *given* or *supplied*
        to `moveForward()`'s **parameter**.  Since this value can change, you will
        often see a written description for the command that looks something like
        **`moveForward(pixels)`** to indicate that the value supplied to `moveForward()`'s
        **parameter** should be the number of pixels you want it move.\r
        \r
        The
        good old `moveForward()` command still exists.  In fact it's the **same command**
        as `moveForward(pixels)`. The "parameter-less" version of `moveForward()`
        simply supplies a **default value** to the parameter.  We might also say that
        the `moveForward()` command has an **optional parameter** since you could
        call either `moveForward()` or `moveForward(50)` and it doesn't cause an
        error when you run the program.\r

        This time you're going to write your own function
        with parameters to complete an image. Two function calls to `drawTriangle()`
        have been placed at the top of the program but the function itself needs to
        be defined.  The program should draw this:\r
        \r
        ![](https://images.code.org/4a96eff03ba79b881b98137048140953-image-1442523578705.59.20

        \r
        # Do This:\r
        **Complete** the function definition for `drawTriangle(sideLength)`
        . Notice that you have already been given a **descriptive and meaningful parameter
        name**, `sideLength`, but you can change it if you wish.\r
        \r
        **Hint:**
        you should put the pen down and pick it up as part of the definition of `drawTriangle()`
        - that way you guarantee that a call to drawTriangle will always actually
        draw. Picking the pen up as the last act of the function is a nice thing to
        do for any other code that might not be expecting drawTriangle to have a side
        effect of putting the pen down.\r
        \r
        As a reminder of how to use a parameter
        within the function here is a correct version of `drawSquare(size)` for reference.\r

        the loop, which might involve achieving more subgoals, like `//Move turtle`
        and `//Orient turtle`.\r

        When breaking a problem
        down, you often encounter elements that you want to use repeatedly in your
        code. Sometimes it's appropriate to write a new function; at other times
        it's appropriate to write a loop.  \r
        \r
        There is no hard-and-fast rule
        as to which is better, but what do you think?  What kinds of circumstances
        would lead you to writing a function versus using a loop?\r

        Programmers write comments into their code for two

        own thoughts or plans for code they write.  \r
        \r
        For both cases a programmers
        **write comments into their code to explain their thinking to the reader.**\r
        \r
        The
        subgoal comments you've seen are a specific type of commenting meant to help
        you learn.  As you get more experience  programming, comments you write can
        be in addition to, or simply replace your subgoal comments.\r

        <div style="background-color:

        <p>\r
        When sharing code with
        others, comments are useful to point out sections of code you might want help
        with, or to explain a complicated section of code that's hard to reason about.  It's
        useful for example to write a comment like: <code>//This function assumes
        that the fish have already been drawn</code> because it helps the reader understand
        when, where, why that section of code might be executed.\r
        </p>\r
        <p></p>\r
        <p>\r
        When
        writing comments for yourself, it might be a note about how you plan to solve
        a problem, or jotting down the reason you did something to remind yourself
        later when you come back to it.  For example you might write a comment like:
        <code>//to do: make a function to handle this code below</code>\r
          </p>\r
          <p>\r
          Many
        programmers, when starting from scratch, like to write out a high level plan
        for the code they want to write in comments, and then go in starting writing
        code to fill in the plan. This is particularly useful if you're facing a
        large problem that needs to be broken down into parts.  You can think about
        the big picture to start and write out a strategy in comments so you don't
        forget it later -- which happens -- because once you start writing code you'll
        run into lots of micro-hurdles that might take time to solve or work out the

        If you add some randomness to
        turtle behavior inside a loop, the program will run a little differently every
        time which can make for some cool effects.\r
        \r
        You're about to see a program
        in which the turtle **moves to a random location** each iteration of the loop,
        and **draws a randomly-sized dot** that also has a **random color**.  We've
        also made the dot semi-transparent by setting the alpha value to 0.5 (50%
        transparency).\r

        # Introducing Subgoals\r
        Writing
        code is fun, but as you write longer programs that solve more complex problems
        it's useful to think at a higher level about the **series of subgoals** that
        build toward the solution.\r
        \r
        In App Lab we have provided special blocks
        called [`Goals`](#triggercallout=goals_palette) to help you think about the
        **subgoals** of the problems you're solving. ([Show me](#triggercallout=goals_palette))\r
        \r
        These
        subgoal blocks are known as "comments" which programmers use to make notes
        to themselves or other people who might view the code. You can drag these
        blocks into your code to help label things and stay organized, but they won't
        do anything when you run the program.  Try it out.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        *
        Don't add any code, just click `Run` and notice the following:\r
        * In the
        workspace we've added the subgoals `//Move turtle` and `//Orient turtle`
        a few places in the code. ([Show me](#triggercallout=show_code)) \r
        * Underneath
        each subgoal, we've added the blocks to complete the subgoal.\r
        * The point
        is to simply notice that the subgoals don't change the drawing or what the
        turtle does.\r
        * The turtle is still only controlled by the blue turtle command
        blocks\r
        \r
        After running the program, click `Finish` to move on to try
        it yourself.\r
        \r
        \r
        <!--\r
        \r
        This is how we'll be using App Lab throughout
        this unit. You'll get several puzzles to solve by dragging blocks from the
        toolbox to the workspace. Sometimes the workspace will tell you the subgoals
        of the puzzle, and sometimes you'll have to identify the subgoals yourself.\r
        \r
        The
        first step of every puzzle will be to put the subgoals of the problem in the
        workspace (if they aren't already there). Then you'll put the blocks that
        solve the subgoals underneath.\r
        \r
        In the workspace below, we've added
        two subgoals, Move turtle and Orient turtle. Underneath each subgoal, we've
        added the blocks to complete the subgoal.\r
        \r
        The subgoals are described
        in comment blocks. This means that the subgoal comment will be visible in
        your code, but they won't do anything when you run the code. Comments are
        purely to make notes to yourself or other people who might view the code.\r
        \r
        Do
        This:\r
        \r
        Press the Run button to `run` the code. Notice that the subgoals
        don't show up in the drawing. Only the blocks will make the turtle do something.\r

        notice that different web browsers, or even different versions of the same
        browser, display a website differently. Often this is because you either missed
        a rule of HTML, or didn’t describe your content specifically enough. Fortunately
        there’s a tool called the Validator that can check your code for errors!\r

        Welcome to Artist! First off, let's
        try to make a simple square using the turn right block and move forward block.
        Each side should be 100 pixels long.\r
        \r
      Standalone_Artist_2_markdown_instruction: |
        Draw this diamond with 120 and 60
        degree angles and 150 pixel long sides.\r
        \r
      Standalone_Artist_3_markdown_instruction: |
        Can you draw this hexagon with 100
        pixel sides and 60 degree turns?\r
        \r
      Standalone_Artist_4_markdown_instruction: |
        Now you've got a new block to play
        with, the loop. This will repeat a set of commands. What happens if you loop
        these commands 6 times?\r
        \r
      Standalone_Artist_5.5_markdown_instruction: |
        Notice how we simplified the diamond
        code by turning it into a loop. You can loop that whole sequence 12 times
        to draw the flower. Hint: You'll need to turn 30 degrees after your diamond
        loop so you don't keep drawing over the same diamond.\r
        \r
      Standalone_Artist_5_markdown_instruction: |
        How many times do you need to loop
        this diamond to draw the flower?\r
        \r
      Standalone_Artist_6_markdown_instruction: |
        Loop this hexagon code 6 times to
        create the design. How many degrees will you need to turn each time? Hint:
        divide the number of degrees in a circle by the number of times you are looping.\r
        \r
      Standalone_Artist_7_markdown_instruction: |
        A function is another programming
        tool to help you avoid repeating yourself. This function draws a flower, so
        you can use it any time you want to draw a flower. Use this and the new jump
        block to draw these flowers. Hint: The flowers are 150 pixels apart\r
        \r
      Standalone_Artist_8_markdown_instruction: |
        Here's a function called `Draw
        a shape` that we've programmed to draw hexagons. Run the code to see what
        it does and then experiment with the function to see what happens. Can you
        make it draw a pattern of squares, triangles, or octagons?\r
        \r
      Standalone_Artist_9_markdown_instruction: |

        throughout unit 1. Your plan should address the following: \r
        \r
        - For lessons
        that call for students to discover a key computer science concept, how do
        you plan to balance your time frontloading content instruction with students’
        time completing the activity and constructing their own knowledge? \r
        - What
        is your strategy for supporting students who struggle with this model of teaching
        and learning, and look to you to ‘just give them the answer’?\r
        - How do
        you plan to make sure students leave a lesson having discovered the underlying
        concept(s)? \r

        concepts themselves. It’s important to think through implementation plans\nand
        student support. In this task you will make a plan for teaching and student\nsupport
        that takes into account differentiation strategies and make-up work\nfor absent
        students. Your teaching and student support plan should cover the\nfollowing:
        \\r\n\\r\n- **Details on how you will implement and differentiate\nthe lesson:**\\r\n\\r\n
        - An outline of any changes you will need to make to\nthe lesson to fit your
        local constraints or context (for example: pacing and\ntime, dealing with
        classroom setup, etc). \\r\n - An overview of the types\nof student needs
        you’ll likely need to support in your classroom (for example:\nstudents who
        are struggling to understand the underlying concept; students\nwho are already
        familiar with the concept, but still have room to learn more;\netc)\\r\n -
        Your plan for addressing each of the needs outlined above (for\nexample: integrating
        extension activities or other materials for students\nwho already know something
        about the topic)\\r\n<br><Br>\\r\n\\r\n- **Plan for\ncatching up absent students:**\\r\n\\r\n

        **Directions:**

        You're
        in a class called *Computer Science Principles*.

        You might not know anything
        about computer science right now.  You might know a few things.  We're going
        to take the pulse of the class to see on the first day what we think computer
        science involves, and we'll revisit this occasionally.

        **Do this:**

        **Without
        using the words _computer_ or *science* write 5 to 10 words or phrases** that
        come to mind when you hear the term "computer science". What do you think

        ## Sending Formatted
        Text Activity\r
        \r
        **Directions:**  \r
        Work with a partner or in a small
        team to develop a protocol that allows you to send formatted text. \r
        \r
        **Guidelines:**  \r
        -
        Both the text and the formatting instructions must be derived from the printable
        ASCII character set (i.e. codes 32-126).\r
        - Your protocol must encode at
        least:\r
        \t- bold, italics, and underlining\r
        \t- three different font sizes
        (large, medium, and small)\r
        \t- three different font colors (red, black,
        blue)\r
        - You will demonstrate that your protocol works by having the recipient
        be able to faithfully draw (or produce in some fashion) the formatted text
        based only on the data she received through an ASCII-text version of the Internet
        Simulator. A sample message can be found below.\r

        **Develop
        Your Protocol:**  \r

        # Encrypt and decrypt a message with the
        Vigenère cipher\r
        \r
        This is an interactive version of the Vigenère cipher
        that animates the encryption and decryption as it’s happening, given a piece
        of text to encrypt or decrypt and the key.\r
        \r
        # Do this\r
        ### Encrypt
        a message\r
        Click Step several times, and trace what’s happening. Pay attention
        to:\r
        \r
        - How the ciphertext is being produced\r
        - What happens when you
        get to the last character of the key\r
        - After you’ve stepped through a few
        characters click Play to watch the rest animate\r
        - Hit Restart and play
        the animation again. You can use the speed slider to speed it up or slow it
        down  \r

        ###
        Decrypt a message\r
        Encrypt a message as above, then:  \r
        \r
        - Highlight
        and copy the ciphertext\r
        - Paste it into the plaintext area. Note: Don’t
        change the key\r
        - Change the Encrypt/Decrypt toggle to Decrypt\r
        - Hit
        Step a few times, and then Play\r
        \r
        You should see the original text emerge.  \r

        This
        tool lets you play with text and do substitution ciphers. It also shows you
        a frequency analysis of the input text. (We’ll look at that more in a later
        lesson.) You can use this to either encrypt a message or decrypt it.\r
        \r
        #
        Do this\r
        - Load the **Sample message (easy)** from the message dropdown.
        This will load a message that has been encrypted with a Caesar cipher.\r

        \r
        -
        Using the buttons in the Caesar substitution tab, you can shift the alphabet
        forwards or backwards to try to unscramble the message.\r

        This version of the tool gives you more information about the
        encrypted text and more options for how to try out different substitutions.\r
        \r
        ###
        Different ways analyze text\r
        - Play with some of the sorting options available
        in the Random substitution cipher tab to get different views on the letter
        frequencies in the input text as well as standard English text.\r

        \r
        ###
        Different ways to substitute\r
        - To substitute a letter you can drag a blue
        letter of the alphabet directly underneath the orange letter you want changed
        in the original ciphertext.\r

        \r
        ###
        Play.  Always play.\r
        - There are other ways to analyze and substitute characters
        that you can find by clicking on the buttons and trying out whatever you like.\r
        -
        Remember: you can't break it :)\r

        # An Updated Internet
        Simulator\r
        Many changes have been made to the Internet Simulator. \r
        \r
        **Routers:**
        Rather than being connected to your entire class you are now connected to
        a single router. You can see who else is on your router in the network diagram.\r
        \r

        \r
        \r
        **IP Addresses:** Every user has a unique IP address. The
        first portion is the number of your router and the second is your own unique
        number. You can figure out the IP addresses of people on the router by looking
        at the network diagram.\r

        \r
        **Sending Messages: ** You can now send messages to a single
        other user. Fill in the "To" portion of the message with the IP address
        (including the period) of the person you'd like to send your message to.\r

        ## Packets
        and Making a Reliable Internet\r
        \r
        **Challenge:** Develop a protocol for
        reliably sending a message across an unreliable network\r
        \r
        **An Unreliable
        Internet Simulator:** The current version of the Internet Simulator is modeled
        after some actual constraints of the Internet\r
        - Messages must be divided
        into packets which may contain <em><strong> at most eight (8) ASCII characters
        </em></strong>\r
        - Messages should be long enough to require at least 10
        packets\r
        - Packets may not arrive in the order sent\r
        - Packets may be
        dropped while in transmission\r
        \r
        **Directions:** In a group or individually
        join a router in the Internet Simulator and practice sending messages given
        these new constraints. Once you are comfortable with the challenge, iteratively
        design a protocol that can reliably send a message to a partner. You and your
        partner should join <em><strong> DIFFERENT </strong></em> routers.\r
        \r
        **Protocol
        Requirements:**\r
        - All communication can only be done through the Internet
        Simulator\r
        - You must send a message that spans at least 10 packets (i.e.
        an 80 character ASCII message). \r
        - The protocol should account for the
        possibility that the characters might be entirely random (i.e. not necessarily
        English - do not count on human intuition to reconstruct the message. The
        message is not known beforehand.)\r
        - The sender and receiver must be confident
        the full message was successfully transmitted and reconstructed.

        In our last exercise
        we created our array and initialized it with some values. Another way to do

        command.\r

        To
        append means to add or to join. When you append an item to an array you actually
        add a new location to the end of the array that contains the new value, so
        that the total size of the array grows by one.  Since you can always add items
        to an array after creating it, it is very common to  **create an empty array
        and then add values in subsequent portions of your program**.\r
        \r
        # Do
        This:\r
        \r
        * **Read the documentation** for `appendItem`.\r
        * Create an
        **empty array** called `oddNumbers`.\r

        Nice
        work! Your application should now have some simple output displaying one of
        your favorite things and indicating which item of your list you are showing.
        To make things more interesting, however, **we want to be able to change which
        item we display**.\r
        \r
        To change the item displayed, the user will use
        the "Next" and "Last" buttons. These should **increase or decrease the
        global index by one and then you should update the information displayed on
        the screen**. To start out with, however, we'll just be writing code for
        our Next Button. \r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        * **Add an event handler** to the
        "Next" button.\r
        * Write code in this event handler that **increments your
        global index variable** and then **updates the output on the screen**.\r
        \t*
        **Note:** If your code from the last exercise was written to reference this
        variable then you should just be able to reuse it once you've incremented
        your variable. We'll talk more about this in the next exercise.\r

        # Last Button\r
        \r
        Our
        user can now move forward through our list of favorite things, and we're
        about to write code that allows them to move backwards as well. If you've
        written your code to reference your global index then this should only require
        you to decrease its value by one and reuse code that updates the screen output.
        Before we write the code for backwards let's work on cleaning up our code.\r
        \r
        **Removing
        Repeated Code:** Once you add the code for moving backwards through your array,
        your program will have three places where it updates the screen by setting
        the text of your screen elements. Rather than repeating this code we should
        **create a function** that updates the screen and then call it every time
        we need to refresh those elements. This will not only make our program easier
        to read and avoids the errors that can arise from redundant code, but it also
        makes it easier to make changes to how our program runs, since all the code
        that updates the screen is in a single place.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        * **Write
        a function** that contains the `setText` commands you have used to update
        the screen.\r
        * **Replace** the places in your code where you used to have
        these commands with **calls to your new function**.\r
        * **Add an event handler**
        to the "Last" button that decreases the **global index variable** by one
        and then updates the screen by calling your new function.\r
        * Run your program
        to confirm that the user **can move forward AND backward** through the list
        and that the output displayed is correct.\r
          * **Note:** You may notice
        that your program throws an error if the global index variable goes out of
        bounds. Don't worry about this for now - we'll fix it in a later exercise.

        Now
        we want our user to be able to add items of their own to the list. As you
        might have guessed, this is as easy as inserting an item into our array at
        the current index.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r

            * Uses`insertItem` to
        add that item to your array at the current index.\r

        function to update the screen (the new item should be displayed).\r

        Currently the user can increase or decrease the value in

        already seen that errors are generated.\r
        \r
        To prevent this from happening,
        we're going to **add `if` statements** to the event handlers on the "Next"
        and "Last" buttons. They should check the value of the global index variable
        before changing it. If the user is about to step out of the bounds of your
        array they should either:\r
        \r
        * **Block:** Do not change the index if it
        will result in a value that is out of bounds.\r
        * **Wrap:** Set the index
        to be the other end of the array. In other words, going past the end of the
        array moves the index back to 0 and going past the beginning of the array
        sets the index to the last in the array (`list.length` will be helpful here).\r
        \r
        #
        Do This:\r
        \r
        * **Add `if` statements** to the event handlers on the "Next"
        and "Last" buttons that **prevent the global index from going out of bounds**
        using one of the two strategies described above.\r
        * Run your program to
        confirm that the user **cannot go out of bounds** and that the output displayed

        # Accessing Items in an Array\r
        \r
        An
        array is comprised of many locations. You can individually set or reference
        the information at each location of your array just like a variable. To tell
        your locations apart each has a separate number, or **index**, that identifies
        it.\r
        \r
        Arrays in JavaScript are **zero-indexed** which means the first
        index is 0. This is similar to binary number systems which begin counting
        at 0. For example an array of 10 items would have indexes 0-9. As a result
        **the last index is always one less than the length of the array**.\r
        \r
        **Accessing
        Array Items by Index:** If you know the index of the item you wish to access
        you can reference it using square brackets `list[index]` . The example below
        prints the value of the 4th element in the array.  \r

        \r
        We have been accessing information in an array by
        using numbers, but we can actually use **any expression that evaluates to
        a number as an index in our array**. The first example of this we will explore
        is accessing the last item in our array.\r
        \r
        Arrays are **zero-indexed**,
        which means that the first index is 0. Therefore an array with a length of
        3 will have indexes 0, 1, and 2. Notice that **the last index is 1 less than
        the length**. This will always be the case, and so we can use this expression
        to access the last element in any array:\r

        * The **slight difference will be that you will

        circle might look like the one below. This line of code is certainly a mouthful,
        but it's basically the same as the line of code in your `mousemove` event
        handler; **it just references the event in the list instead.** <br><img src="https://images.code.org/dbb4cd9b98eba70aa2919a93544c1e03-image-1448314845862.40.21

        # Adjusting Circle Size\r
        \r
        Among
        the other pieces of information contained in each `event` parameter are the
        values `movementX` and `movementY`. These numbers tell us how far (in pixels)
        the mouse moved since the last mouse event was triggered, and can be used
        to measure the speed of the mouse. ** If the movement is large, the mouse
        is moving fast; if the movement is small, the mouse is moving slowly.**\r
        \r
        Let's
        use the mouse movement speed to make a cool effect. When we draw with a real
        pen or brush, the line usually gets thin when making quick strokes and is
        wider and darker when making slower ones. We can generate this effect by **using
        `movementX` and `movementY` to calculate the radius for the circle.**  Since
        this calculation might be a little tricky, a smart thing to do would be to
        **write a function** that takes `movementX` and `movementY` as parameters
        and **returns** a value that should be used as the radius.\r
        \r

        \r
        There
        are several ways to do this. One possible way to write the function is provided
        on the right, which uses some arithmetic tricks. The function to the right
        is actually only three lines of code but is heavily commented to explain what
        it's doing. It makes use of a function called **`Math.abs` which returns
        the absolute value of a number.** Feel free to use this or another method
        of converting `movementX` and `movementY` into a radius.\r
        \r
        <details>
        <summary><strong>What is Absolute Value?</strong> [click to expand]</summary>\r
        `Math.abs`
        takes a number as input and returns the positive version of this number. \r
        \r
        In
        math, absolute value is often written with this | | symbol. So |10| is the
        absolute value of ten and |-10| is the absolute value of negative ten. Both
        evaluate to 10.\r
        \r
        In Javascript we use `Math.abs` instead of | |.  `Math.abs(-10)`
        and `Math.abs(10)` both evaluate to <strong>10</strong>.\r
        </details> <br>\r
        \r
        #
        Do This:\r
        \r
        * **Write a function like the one above** that accepts two
        parameters (one each for `movementX` and `movementY`) and returns a radius.
        A higher speed should lead to a smaller radius.\r
        * **Inside your `mousemove`
        event handler,** set the radius of the circle to the value returned by your
        function, where the function takes `event.movementX` and `event.movementY`
        as input.  For example, if using the function above, your code would be: <br>![](https://images.code.org/94a379336084954ba2ab27e80b17dee3-image-1448314255797.30.22

        of the mouse affects the radius of the dots**. The effect should look something

        If
        you were able to get that working and understand what you did, congratulations!
        That was some serious programming! If not, take a moment to go back and talk
        through the different components with a classmate. Most of the work we'll
        be doing for the rest of this lesson uses similar patterns, and you'll want
        to be comfortable with them as we add more complexity to our app.\r
        \r
        The
        first thing we are going to do is **create an "Original" button that will
        redraw the image with the same circle radius you used before**. The process
        will be nearly identical to how you added the "Random" button.\r
        \r
        In
        fact, the code to redraw the original is *exactly* the same, except instead
        of making the radius of the circle be random, it will just be the fixed value
        you used originally (probably radius 5 or so).\r

        We'll be doing this in two
        steps. For now, all you need to do is **change the first button in the row
        to have the proper styling and attach a click event handler to it**. **In
        addition, clear the canvas from inside the event handler** so we are ready
        to redraw our new image.  We don't want to delete all the items from the

        Now
        we're ready to write the code for our "Random" effect. To do this, we will
        be clearing the canvas and then processing the array `eventList` to redraw
        all the dots with a random radius. \r
        \r
        You already set up the clear canvas,
        so next we'll need to process our array in order to find out the event information
        for each dot. You'll need to create a `for` loop that iterates through every
        index in `eventList` (recall the `length` command). Within your loop, you
        will be drawing dots referencing items stored in the array. \r
        \r
        As you
        write this code, remember that **you can treat an individual element of an
        array exactly like the kind of data it stores**. Inside a `for` loop, the
        event at index `i` can be accessed with the notation `eventList[i]` and the
        `offsetX` of that event can be accessed with `eventList[i].offsetX`. Again,

        \r
        You
        may have noticed that the **`event` parameter includes information about whether
        certain keys were pressed when the event fired**. They are stored in variables
        with names like `shiftKey` or `altKey` and are stored as boolean values (true
        / false). We are going to use the `shiftKey` variable to decide when we should

        # Relative Indexes\r
        \r
        When
        looping over an array, we use a counter variable (typically `i`) to keep track
        of which index we're at. We can then access the contents at each index with
        the syntax `list[i]`.\r
        \r
        If we want, however, we could access the contents
        of the next element as well, since its index is just one greater. For example,
        if we are currently focused on the element at index `i`, then `list[i+1]`
        gives us access to the next element in the array. In other words, you can
        **reference indexes relative to your counter variable**.\r

        \r
        We
        are going to use relative indexing to create our final effect, which will
        look sort of like an etching of the image. The idea is simple:  **for every
        (x,&nbsp;y) location in the event list, draw a straight line between that
        location and the location stored 10 spots further down the array.** You will
        use the **`line` command** to draw a line connecting these points.\r

        * **Read the documentation for `line`**.\r
        * **Set the style
        of the final button** in Design Mode, give a label like "Etch," give it
        a descriptive ID, and attach a click event handler to it.\r
        * **Call `clearCanvas`**
        to clear the screen.\r
        * Create a `for` loop that counts from **0 to `eventList.length
        - 10`**. \r
        \t* Why do you think we're not counting over the entire array?\r
        *
        Use `line` to draw a line between the (x,&nbsp;y) locations of `eventList[i]`
        and `eventList[i+10]`.  The full line of code will be another big one: ![](https://images.code.org/5de2c40b56042069379ff20ce5d10cab-image-1448393948598.38.49

        know what key the user pressed on a `keyPress` event, we checked the value
        stored in `event.key`. **The event parameter actually stores a great deal
        more information about each event**. \r
        \r
        When using the mouse, the event
        parameter carries information like the location of the mouse, how fast it's
        moving, and some other things as well. \r
        \r
        Let's get acquainted with
        the event parameter and what we can find out about the mouse.\r
        \r
        # Do
        This:\r
        \r
        * Add a `console.log` command inside the function of your event
        handler. Use it to display the `event` parameter.\r
        * Run your program and
        click your canvas. **The full contents of the `event` parameter should be
        displayed in the console**. \r
        * **Which values do you think hold the x and
        y coordinates**?  What else is there?\r
        * We won't use all of these, but
        it's interesting to see just how much is available.\r
        * Once you have experimented
        a little, move to the next level.\r

        \r
        You can express more complex conditions by combining **AND**
        and **OR** in one statement.  Here is the example from the previous page which
        you can use as a reference. This statement will evaluate to **true** if the
        day is Tuesday or Thursday AND their age is 15 or 16.\r

        * Otherwise it should write "Uh oh. Have to wake up."\r

      U3 - Conditionals - Combine AND OR and NOT_markdown_instruction: |-
        # Combining
        AND and OR and NOT\r
        \r
        You can stick a NOT (`!`) in front of any boolean
        expression to invert its result. This opens the door to express the same logical
        statements in different ways.  \r
        \r
        For example, let's say you want to
        determine if a person, based on his or her age (under 12 or over 65) gets
        to pay a reduced price for a movie ticket.  You might express that like this:\r
        \r
        ```\r
        //
        If your age is less than 12 or greater than 65\r
        if( (age < 12) || (age >
        65) ){\r
        \twrite("You qualify for a reduced price!");\r
        }\r
        ```\r
        \r
        But
        you might also figure out a way to determine if a person gets a reduced price
        ticket by determining if his or her age is between 12 and 65 (`(age >= 12)
        && (age <= 65)`) and then taking the inverse of that.  So using the NOT operator
        this would work as well:\r
        \r
        ```\r
        // If your age is NOT between 12 and
        65\r
        if( !( (age >= 12) && (age <= 65) ) ){\r
        \twrite("You qualify for
        a reduced price!");\r
        }\r
        ```\r
        \r
        **Why use one over the other?** Personal
        preference.  Use the one that makes the most sense to you, but it should be
        a clear expression of what you are trying to say.  \r

        school!" if it's a weekday and the user is under 18.\r
         \t* Hint: one way
        to say that it's a weekday is to say that it's NOT a weekend.\r
         * Otherwise,
        if it's a weekday and the user is 18 or older, it should write "Time to
        go to work!"\r
         * Otherwise, it should write "Time to relax for the weekend!"\r

        **WARNING** logic can get tricky sometimes.  Make sure to test your
        program with inputs that cover every possibility. There are 4 basic cases

        We're
        ready to start improving the "My Favorite Things" app. \r
        \r
        We'll do
        this in two steps:\r
        1. We will change it from scrolling text to scrolling
        images.\r
        2. We will add key events to scroll with the keyboard.\r
        \r
        **Step
        1:**\r
        * The default values in your array should be image URLs.\r
        * The
        large **text area** needs to be changed to an **image**.\r
        * Instead of **setting
        the text**, you'll now be using `setImageURL` to set the URL of the image.\r

        Do This:\r
        **NOTE: We've re-loaded the code from the "My Favorite Things"

        just wrote, you can go back to look at it.)\r
        \r
        * **Set the default values**
        in your array to be image URLs. (You might need to take a minute to go collect
        a few if you didn't in preparation for this lesson.)\r
        * In Design Mode
        **delete the text area** and replace it with an **image**. Make sure your
        image has a descriptive and meaningful ID.\r
        * Inside your function that
        updates the display **replace `setText` with `setImageURL`**. Make sure you
        reference your new image element **by its correct ID**.<br>\r

        # Buttons and Keys\r
        \r
        We
        now know how to respond to key events, but often we want the user to be able
        to **do the same thing with the app in multiple ways**. For example, we might
        want the app to exhibit the same behavior if the user clicks a button on the
        screen or a key on the keyboard. (This is how so-called "keyboard shortcuts"
        work.)\r
        \r
        In the program you're about to see, we've provided event handlers
        for some buttons on the screen. You're going to **create identical functionality**
        for the key events.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        * **Add conditional statements
        inside the `keydown` event handler** to check for when the **up and down arrows**
        are pressed.\r

        statement.\r

        * Confirm your app **responds to key events** by running
        it.  For example, clicking the image of the up arrow in the app should do
        the same thing as hitting the up arrow on the keyboard.\r

        \r
        Over
        the course of this lesson we are going to be working towards improving our
        "My Favorite Things" app to add some new features. Our improved app will
        be able to:\r
        \r
        * Respond to **key events**.\r
        * **Display images** by
        storing their URLs.\r

        \r
        You're
        now ready to add key event functionality to your app! As you are doing so,
        keep an eye out for places where you need to **refactor** old code in order
        to prevent redundancy. **Create functions** that carry out repeated tasks
        and make other changes to keep your code **readable and consistent**. \r
        \r
        If
        you want a reminder of how key events work, you can always go back to the
        example from earlier in this lesson.  You will need to add `if` statements
        to check for which keys were pressed, just as before.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        *
        Add the ability to respond to **key events** to your app.\r
        \r
        * **Refactor
        your old code** to remove redundant portions.\r
        \r
        * Keeping adding to your
        program. What other features do you want to include?
      U3 - Keys - Functions_markdown_instruction: |-
        # Refactoring Code\r
        \r
        On the
        last level, we copied a few lines of code to a different part of our program.
        **Hopefully warning bells went off in your head!** Any time you are copying
        portions of code from one area of your program to another, it's a good indication
        that you should write a function to capture that behavior in one place. \r
        \r
        When
        you add new features to your code **you will often create redundancies**.
        To keep your code readable and consistent, you may need to rewrite old pieces
        of code. This process of restructuring existing code without changing its
        external behavior is called **refactoring**. It is an important process when
        developing software that improves code readability and reduces complexity.
        As a result, code is much easier to maintain.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        * **Create
        a function called `doUpArrow`**. \r
        * Move the code from the `upArrow` event
        handler to the function.\r
        * **Call `doUpArrow`** from both your button and
        key event handlers. (The animation below shows the steps above.)\r
        * Repeat
        the same process for the down arrow / button by creating a function called
        `doDownArrow`.\r
        * Once you have **removed these redundancies from your code**
        test your app to make sure it still works!\r

        \r
        * Move the `playSound` command from the top
        of the program inside the `else-if`. (Notice that in the example, we switch

        Right now this code rolls two dice as long as either one
        of them is less than 3.   Modify the condition so that both dice have to be
        greater than 3 for the loop to stop.\r

        one.
      U3 - Loops -  Complex Condition_markdown_instruction: |-
        # Expressing Stopping
        Conditions: "Until Loops"\r
        It is often more natural to think about looping
        in terms of when the loop should end rather than when it should continue.
        For example you might say "keep going down the road until you see the gas
        station" or "keep calling until you get through to someone." You might
        think of these as "until loops" rather than "while loops," since we want
        the loop to continue **until a condition is true rather than while a condition
        is true**.\r
        \r
        **There is no "until loop" in JavaScript** but it is actually
        quite easy to translate "until loops" into `while` loops so that you can
        use them in programs. An "until loop" runs *until* a condition is true,
        as opposed to a while loop which runs *as long as* a condition is true.  That
        means an until loop is the logical inverse of a while loop - it runs as long
        as the **condition is false**. The table below shows how you can use the **NOT**
        ( `!` ) operator to translate stopping conditions into `while` loop conditions.\r

        we can use the **NOT** operation to find the **logical inverse** (or opposite)

         **The `while` loop
        uses a boolean condition to repeatedly run a block of code.**  It checks the
        expression, and if it is true it runs the block of code contained within it.
        This process of checking the condition and running the block of code is repeated
        as long as the boolean condition remains true. **Once the boolean expression
        becomes false it will stop.**\r
        \r
        We are going to start exploring a `while`
        loop by **modifying the condition on which a `while` loop runs and using `console.log`

        Instead

        the `while` loop by changing the variable used in the boolean expression differently.

        use the form of `count = count + 1` where we can change 1 to be any number
        we want to count up by. The `++` and `--` operators only work for counting
        by one.\r

        \r
        We
        wanted to stop counting at 30, but when you count by 4 you will actually never

        when the number is **greater than 30**. This is an important defensive programming
        strategy. Make the condition catch more cases than you think you need so that

        # Using an *if* Statement In a Loop\r
        \r
        A
        common thing to do is to use variables to keep track of some sort of count.  When
        used in a loop we count things very quickly.\r
        \r
        **Scenario:**\r
        If you
        roll a pair of dice, rolling a 12 (two sixes) is rare.  How rare?  If you
        were to roll a pair of dice 1,000 times, on average, how many times would
        it come up as 12?\r
        \r
        To figure this out, we could write code to run an
        experiment. It would go something like this:\r
        * Make a loop that simulates
        rolling a pair of dice 1,000 times.\r
        * Inside the loop, add an `if` statement:
        **if die1 + die2 == 12, then add 1 to a counter**.\r
        * After the loop, display
        the result.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        The **starter code** sets up the whole experiment
        for you, except it doesn't count the number of 12's rolled - that's your
        job.\r
        \r
        * **Run the code** to see what the experiment does.\r
        \r
        * **
        Add an `if` statement inside the loop** to check if the sum of the dice is
        equal to 12, and add 1 to `twelveCount`.\r
        \r
        *  Once the loop has completed,
        **display the number of times the sum was 12.**\r
        \r
        **Note:** If you remove
        (or comment out) the `console.log` statement that displays every roll of the
        dice, the experiment will speed up A LOT!  You could do tens of thousands
        of dice rolls in a matter of seconds.

        in the `while` loop, and it never reaches the rest of your program. **We normally

        something about the state of the program** - usually the value of a variable

        # Starting Condition\r
        \r
        We have seen
        that loops can run infinitely. On the last level we saw that there is also
        the **chance that the loop never runs at all!** If the condition of the `while`
        loop starts out false then the loop will never run.\r
        \r
        We fixed this problem
        in the last exercise by displaying the value of `num` in two places: before
        the loop and in the loop. Duplicating code is generally a bad strategy, so
        the question is: can we be a little clever and get into the loop without missing
        any values?  The answer is yes.\r
        \r
        **The solution** is to initialize the
        values used in our boolean expression so that we are **certain** it will evaluate
        to true the first time the loop checks it.  **For example, if your loop condition
        is: `while (num != 6)` you could initialize `num` to anything other than 6
        and you'd know that you get into the loop**.  \r
        \r
        If you use this technique
        though...\r
        1. You need to make sure you set the value of `num` right away
        inside the loop.\r
        2. You probably want to use a nonsense value like -1,
        so that if you ever see that displayed it will be obvious something is wrong
        and be easier to debug.\r

        Check out the new box
        that has appeared next to the Debug Console! These are the debug commands
        and they are extremely powerful.  These commands allow us to stop a program
        at a certain point in its execution and slowly follow, step-by-step, what
        is happening during the run. \r
        \r
        In order, **to use the debug commands
        you first have to add a breakpoint**. Breakpoitns tell the computer that when
        you hit this line of code pause and wait for the programmer to tell you what
        to do next. A breakpoint is marked by <img src="https://images.code.org/99c9685af5b15840287b41620cdc82ea-image-1446739738049.08.36

        # *++* Operator\r

        As programmers
        we are always looking for more concise ways to write code. It is so common
        to add 1 to a variable such as in `count = count + 1` that there is actually
        a shorthand for it. \r
        \r
        # Introducing the *++* Operator\r
        \r
        You can
        write `count++` to add 1 to `count`. `count++` does the exact same thing as
        `count = count + 1`! \r
        \r
        In fact the computer turns `count++` into `count
        = count + 1` behind the scenes - it really is just a convenient shorthand.\r
        \r
        **Note:**
        This is more of a programmer style choice so if you want to write your code

        is still going to be a great strategy but **the Debug Console can do even
        more for us!**\r
        \r
        **Check this out:** We can check the value of a variable

        within the Debug Console and hitting "enter". **This is another powerful
        tool for debugging your programs.** \r

        # Try Out the *-=* Operator\r
        \r
        The
        `-=` operator works almost identically to `+=`, but instead it subtracts the
        value provided from the variable. Let's use this operator to **create a loop
        that counts down from 30 by 3's**.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        * **Change the
        code to use `-=`** to count from *down* from 30 to 0 by 3's.
      U3 - Loops - plus and minus = operator_markdown_instruction: |-
        # Introducing
        *+=* and *-=* Operators\r
        \r
        Sometimes you want to add or subtract something
        *other than 1* from the current value of a variable. If you wanted to add
        or subtract 3 for example, such as: `count = count + 3` or `count = count
        - 3`, `++` and `--` wouldn’t help. \r
        \r
        It turns out this is pretty common
        as well so there is actually a shorthand version of `count = count + 3`. \r
        \r
        **Introducing
        `+=`  and `-=`**!\r
        \r
        We can use the `+=` or `-=` operator to add or subtract
        any value we want to the current value of a variable. \r
        \r
        So, the shorthand
        versions of `count = count + 3` and `count = count - 3` would be:\r
         * `count
        += 3` \r
         * `count -= 3`\r
        \r
        **Notice** that these 3 statements: `count
        = count + 1`,  `count++`, and `count += 1` all do **exactly** the same thing!\r
        \r
        Which
        one you use as a programmer is your choice, and in the future you can use
        either version, but try out the new operator here.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        *
        **Change the code to use `count += 3`** instead of `count = count + 3` so
        the program will still count up by 3. (You'll need to be in text mode to
        do this.) \r

        (You'll get to try out `-=` on the next level.)

        This `for` loop basically means **"for every possible index

        arrays. Common array-processing techniques like searching for a value, updating

        \r
        Instead of displaying a true/false value for *every* item
        in the list, let's compute one value and display it.  A common thing to want
        to do is **count** the number of times a value occurs.  We can do this with
        a very small change to the code we've already got. \r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        **Starter
        Code** is similar to past levels.  We've also created a variable called `fiveCount`.\r
        \r
        *
        ** Add an `if` statement** inside the `for` loop to **increment `fiveCount`
        if the value is equal to 5. **\r
         (Note: this will be exactly the same as
        the `if` statement you wrote in the previous level. Just giving you more practice).\r
        \r
        *
        **Run and re-run your code** to make sure that it's accurately counting the
        number of 5's in the array. Since the array is getting a random set of values
        every time you run the program, you might have to run it a bunch of times
        to thoroughly test it. Make sure you get it to run at least once when no 5's
        appear in the array.\r
        \r
        * Finally, if you'd like to, **change the first
        loop in the program to add 100 items to the array** instead of 10. Your code
        should still work to count the number of 5's, no matter how big the original
        array is!

        In order to make a general search function, we should be able
        to **search for any value, not just 5**.  We can do this by making the value
        to search for a parameter as well.\r

        \r
        * **Add a second

        This example uses the name `searchValue`.\r

        # *for* Loop\r
        \r
        It's
        very common to want to repeat a set of commands a particular number of times.
        Recently, we have been using the `while` loop to do this by creating a counting
        variable, setting the boolean expression, and incrementing the value of the
        counter by 1 each time. We've also used the `for` loop before, and we'll
        explain it more in-depth now.  The `for` loop was created to wrap all of those
        components related to counting loops into a single line of code.\r

        Programmers would typically read a loop `for
        (var i = 0; i < 10; i++)` out like this: <br>\r
        **"for variable i starting
        at 0, while i is less than 10, i plus plus (or increment i by 1)"**\r
        \r
        Notice
        that in reading a `for` loop we still use the word "while".\r
        \r
        You may
        notice that when you drag a `for` loop out from the toolbox that we've set
        it up for you with `i` as the variable. \r

        <summary>**Why
        is `i` the variable?** [click to expand]</summary>  \r
        \r
        Using the single
        character `i` as the variable in a `for` loop has become a convention in programming
        for a variety of reasons. One reason is that `for` loops are often used when
        processing arrays - **you can think of `i` as shorthand for index. **   But
        there is no reason why you have to use `i` if you don't want to.  It's just
        a variable.  \r

        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        * Drag out the `for`
        loop.\r
        \r
        * Insert a `console.log` statement inside the `for` loop that
        displays `i`.\r

        Try changing:\r
        \t* The condition to stop the loop (make it run longer).\r
            *
        The amount you change `i` by each time (try changing `i++` to something like
        `i += 5`).\r

        \r
        Over the next several exercises we will be
        **creating a general-purpose function to determine if a value is contained
        within an array**.  Over the course of these exercises, keep an eye out for
        the general pattern we are using, because you'll get to use it again to create
        functions of your own.\r
        \r
        To begin, we'll start simple. We'll write
        code that **checks whether an array contains a specific value**. At every
        index, your program should display "true" if the value at that index is
        a 5 and "false" otherwise.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        The **starter code** is
        similar to past levels, but you'll notice that we use a loop to construct
        `myArray` rather than appending items one line at a time.  You are also given
        the `for` loop you will use.\r
        \r
        * Add an `if` statement inside the `for`
        loop to check if the value of the array at the current index is 5. \r
         *
        If the value is equal to 5, write **true** to the console. Otherwise write
        **false** to the console.\r
        * **Test your code** to make sure it is working
        as you intend. An example output is below.\r

        check every value within the array. To practice this, we will create a `for`
        loop that will **display every value in the array greater than 5**.\r

        \r
        **What if the value
        doesn't exist?** You should return -1.  The reason for returning -1 is that
        when you write a function that returns a value it's expected that it will
        return one type of data.  So if we're returning a number for the index, we
        should also return a number that indicates it wasn't found. Since -1 (or
        any negative number) is not a possible index for an array, we can use -1 to
        indicate that whatever we're looking for wasn't found.\r

        This exercise comes with starter

        separate `updateTurtle` function is called to draw the turtle on the screen.\r
        \r
        Currently
        the turtle can drive off the screen. If we are clever about how we use our
        `constrain` function, however, we can prevent this from happening.\r

        style="float: right; width: 250px">\r
        The technique is generally referred
        to as **using a boolean "flag."** To understand this idea, think about how
        some mailboxes work: the flag starts down, and when a person wants to let
        the mail carrier know there is something to pick up, she puts the flag up
        to notify the mail carrier that there is outgoing mail in the box.\r
        \r
        We
        can use a variable to do something similar when programming. Rather than incrementing
        a count every time we find a 5 in the array, we will use a variable that acts
        like a **flag**.  We will create a variable before the loop and assign it
        `false` to start (flag is down). Then, as we process the array, if we find
        a 5, set the variable to `true` (put the flag up).  \r
        \r
        Here is some pseudocode:\r
        ```\r
        var
        flag = FALSE\r
        FOR EACH item IN list\r
          IF (item EQUALS 5)\r
            flag
        = TRUE\r
            \r
        DISPLAY (flag)\r
        ```\r
        Notice that it doesn't matter
        if we find more than one 5.  It will just keep setting the flag to `true`.  However,
        if there are no 5's, the `if` statement in the loop will never execute, and
        so the variable will remain the value it was initialized to, which was `false`.\r

        # Adding Rating
        to Keywords\r
        \r
        Up until now our movie suggestions have just been based
        on genre. Let's now also look for keywords related to the movie rating like
        "G", "PG", "PG-13", and "R" so we can give movie suggestions based
        on both genre and rating.\r

        \r
        * **Hint:** When
        checking for "G", "PG" and "R" you need to be a little clever.  R and
        G are letters that will show up in lots of words and PG will get confused
        with PG-13. We want to check for "g" and "r" with spaces on either side.
        So make sure to use `" g "` where there is a space on either side of g instead
        of `"g"`. For "pg" you can just add a space after the pg to look for `"pg

        This exercise comes with starter

        the turtle are stored in the variables `xloc` and `yloc`. An event handler
        is used to update these values when the **arrow keys are pressed**, and then
        a separate `updateTurtle` function is called to draw the turtle on the screen.\r
        \r
        Currently
        the turtle can drive off the screen. If we are clever about how we use our

        We're going to debug another
        function that uses multiple return statements. The function is called `constrain`
        and is used to limit an input number to a certain range. The function accepts

        \r
        * `input` : the number to be constrained.\r
        * `low`
        : the lower bound of the range. If `input` is below this value, the function
        should return the value of `low`.\r
        * `high` : the upper bound of the range.
        If `input` is above this value, the function should return the value of `high`.\r

        # Printing Specific Records\r
        \r
        Sometimes
        we want to search through the records in the table to find certain records.
        For instance let's search through the records for all the movies made in
        2008.\r
        \r
        loop over element in the array returned from readRecord and print
        out only the ones that meet a certain criteria - uses if statement and forshadows
        to search terms\r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        \r
        The data from the last level has also
        been provided. \r
        \r
        * Add a call to readRecords to get the most current
        version of the data table.\r
        * Make a global array which will hold the movies
        that match our search\r
        * Add a for loop to loop over all the records in
        the array\r
        * As you loop over the array check each object to see if the
        year is equal to 2008\r
        * If the movie was made in 2008 add the whole object
        to our global array.\r
        * After you have checked all the items in the array
        print out the array of movies matching the search.

        # Search Terms\r
        \r
        That was
        a lot of work just to find the records which matched 1 search criteria! Well
        good news! There is an easier way! We haven't talked about the second parameter
        in readRecords, the search terms. Up until now we have given it an empty object.
        This means it will return all the records beacuse it does not filter records
        based on any criteria. However if we want to search for something like all
        the movies made in 2008. We can easily do this by providing an object with
        those search criteria!\r
        \r
        The object will contain just the key value pairs
        to look for. Any record that contains those key value pairs will be returned
        as part of the records to the readRecords call.  The key of the key value
        pair will be the column name to look under for a certain value. For example
        to look for movies made in 2008 in our table we would pass an object that
        looked like this:\r
        \r
        `{year: 2008}`\r

        * Print the records returned as the
        parameter to the callback function.\r
        * Notice that it is the same list from

        One

        # Comments and White
        Space\r
        \r
        In HTML and CSS you learned about commenting and white space
        as important practices. You can comment in Game Lab using `//` before our
        comment.  For example <img src="https://images.code.org/c5e94b8bc9e0160e2c98c3adff2ac53f-image-1461101058517.02.55
        PM.png" style="width:110px">. You have already seen examples of this in
        some of the past levels. The comment block can be found in the most tabs.
        However it may be easier to switch to text mode and type in comments yourself.
        If you haven't tried it yet click <img src="https://images.code.org/d7811c0d29028daa74ae9e9561e01bee-image-1461101470090.30.45
        PM.png" style="width:110px"> and try using Game Lab in text mode. It is
        actually impossible to add white space without switching to text mode, so
        in order to group your code using white space, you will have to switch to
        text mode. \r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        You are going to practice using comments and
        white space in your rainbow program. \r
        \r
        * Separate each band of the rainbow

        In order to draw a rainbow
        you are going to use ellipses. You are probably wondering how you can draw
        a rainbow with circles. You are going to use a sneaky trick! You can hide
        half of the circle under rectangles so it looks like they don't exist. Check
        out the images to the right.\r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        The starter code contains
        3 of the ellipses for the rainbow. Your final result should look like the
        drawing above on the right. You will need to:\r
        \r
        * Add 4 more ellipses
        all with the same x and y position as the first three\r
        * Size the ellipses
        appropriately\r
        \t* The smallest ellipse has a width of 100 and a height
        of 100\r
            * Each ellipse's width and height are 50 bigger than the one
        inside of it\r
        * Add a rectangle for grass

        # Fill\r
        \r
        Now, let's
        add some color to your rectangles! You can do that with the `fill` block.  Setting
        the `fill` is like picking the color of pen you are going to draw with, and
        using only that color of pen until you choose a different one.\r
        \r
        * When
        you set `fill`, everything that is drawn after that point will have that fill
        color. \r
        * You need to set `fill` **before** the shape you want it to apply
        to. \r
        \r
        The color of the pen is specified by a lowercase word inside `"
        "` and is the name of the color. You can use any color name you have used
        in CSS. For example `fill("blue")` will set the fill color to blue.  A full
        list of names can be found at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp"

        # Do This\r
        \r
        If you
        run the program, you will notice that all the rectangles are set to red. Make
        each rectangle a different color:\r
        \r
        * Add 3 more fill statements - one
        before each rectangle\r

        Welcome
        to Game Lab.  Game Lab allows you to create interactive games and animations!
        You are going to start with drawing shapes and build up to games over time.
        In class you already practiced the basics of drawing shapes. You are just
        going to translate that skill to the computer. Check out the game area on
        the left. This is where you will see the output of your program.\r
        \r
        The
        first shape you are going to use is the rectangle. The block for a rectangle
        is `rect()`. As you can see, there are four openings in the rect block. These
        values control some aspect of the way the shape is drawn.\r

        # Starting Small\r
        \r
        To start,
        we're going to simulate flipping a coin 10 times. You might be thinking that
        isn't many coin flips, and that we could just do those flips in real life,
        but this is actually an important step in developing a simulation. At small
        scales we can make sure our code is working as intended because **we can still
        visually confirm its output**. Once we're convinced that the logic of our
        program is reliable we'll move up to simulating larger numbers of flips.\r
        \r
        The
        core logic of our program will be focused on **a `while` loop** that simulates
        flipping a coin by repeatedly generating **random 0's or 1's using `randomNumber`**.
        This is a great opportunity to keep practicing using loops while applying
        your knowledge of variables, iteration, and `if` statements.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        *
        When we want to flip a coin with a computer we will instead **generate a random
        number between 0 and 1**.\r
        * Write a program that **uses a `while` loop**
        to **flip a coin 10 times** and writes the value of each flip to the screen.
        The example below shows how your program should run.\r
        * **HINT:** you will
        need to use a counter variable in your `while` loop to keep track of how many
        times the coin has been flipped. \r

        # Changing the Loop Condition\r
        \r
        Currently
        our loop condition is based on a counter variable that keeps track of the
        total number of flips, but our simulation should only run **while we have
        fewer than the target number of heads**. In this exercise you are going to
        change the condition used by your `while` loop so that your **simulation terminates
        once you have flipped 5 total heads**. At the end of the loop we will **write
        the total number of flips** to know how many flips it took to get 5 heads.\r
        \r
        #
        Do This:\r
        \r
        * Change the looping condition to use the variable you are
        using to keep track of the number of heads. **Your loop should run as long
        as you have fewer than 5 total heads**.\r
        * Add code after your loop that
        **writes the total number of flips**.\r
        * **Test your program** several times
        to make sure it works as expected. See the example below.\r
        * **Note:** the
        simulation is always terminating once it flips its 5th heads. Sometimes this
        means the text output runs off the screen. We will address this in the next
        exercise.\r

        logic will stop working as you expected**. In order to feel more confident
        about your model you will **first change the number of heads you are looking
        for to a number that we can still visually verify (7 heads)**. If our code
        still works after making changes then we should be confident that it should
        work at 10,000. We will remove the intermediate output and run the full simulation!\r

        displays the results of each flip.** You can use `//` to comment out a single
        line of code. Make sure that the total count of flips still prints though!\r

        We're

        # Simulating Coin Flips\r
        \r
        Over
        the next several exercises we are going to be building a program that simulates
        flipping 10,000 coins, or even more if you like. Along the way we're going
        to be keeping track of the patterns that develop and hopefully learning something
        about the patterns that develop.\r
        \r
        This is a great problem to simulate
        on a computer. If you wanted to flip 10 coins you'd probably just do it by
        hand. Flipping 10,000 coins would take significantly longer (about 3 hours
        if you flip one per second) and so **we'd much rather use a program to do
        the work for us.** Not only is it a lot faster to write the program, but once
        you're done you can run your program over and over, repeating the experiment.
        As we'll see, **simulations like this make it much easier to quickly notice
        patterns, test hypotheses, and develop new ideas to investigate**.\r
        \r
        **Starting
        Small:** Our simulations are going to start small. We'll actually only be
        flipping 10 coins to begin with, and then developing programs that keep track
        of patterns in this smaller set of data. That way we'll be able to visually
        confirm that our programs are working as intended. **Once we've verified
        that our programs work at a smaller scale we'll gradually increaese the number
        of flips our program is working on until we're at the full 10,000.**\r

        **generate a random number between 0 and 1**\r

        You are
        going to start creating animations with **sprites**. A sprite is like a character
        in your animations. Your program will control how your sprite moves and appears
        on the screen.\r
        \r
        **Creating Sprites:** The first step to using a sprite
        is creating the sprite. In order to do that you'll need to give it a label,
        just like a variable. This block will create a new sprite for you and let
        you choose its label.\r

        Sprites are actually
        part of a larger type of item that you will use frequently in computer science.
        This type of item is called an **object**. An object is **a location in memory
        with a name and properties**. It **associates a bunch of smaller pieces of
        information together**. \r
        \r
        Another type of object is the **Game object**.
        Each game only has one Game object which is set up with initial properties
        for you and it is called Game.\r
        \r
        One of the coolest properties that the
        Game has are the x and y location of the mouse! **You can get the x and y
        location of the mouse using `World.mouseX` and `World.mouseY`.**  This follows
        the pattern you learned before. `Game` is the name of the object. `mouseX`
        and `mouseY` are the names of the properties.\r

        less clear where the upper left corner is. In addition, for things such as

        Text Input in Variables\r
        \r
        Often we want to save the information we pull
        in from the user for later use in our program. The best way to do this is
        to save it in a variable.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        * **Create two variables
        inside your event handler** to store the **age** and **name** of the user.\r
        *
        **Use `getText()` to update the values** stored in each of these variables.\r
        *
        **Change your `console.log` statements to use your variable instead of `getText`**.\r

        On
        the last level we saved the variables as we said we would want to use them
        in the future. We are going to use them now to print nice messages out to
        our user welcoming them and congratulating them on their age. \r
        \r
        Up until
        now we have just printed out different variables on separate lines of code.
        However sometimes we want to combine the variable with some text on the same
        line. \r
        \r
        For example what if I want to say "Welcome to the game, Dani!".
        I need to be able to combine strings. \r
        \r
        The way we do this is with the
        + operator. \r
        \r
        `var sampleSentence = "Welcome to my app, " + name ;`\r
        \r
        Note:
        This may seem a little weird as you can't use any other math symbols on strings
        but someone decided this was easier than writing out a long method name so
        they set it up to work nicely for us. \r
        \r
        \r
        \r
        We are going to user
        Text Area to put text onto the screen as it allows you to put longer blocks
        of text on the screen easily. \r

        Now,
        you'll finally get to modify your 'chaser-game'.  Making the minimum requirement
        might be pretty easy at this point.  Consider some of the enhancements suggested.\r
        \r
        ####
        Minimum requirement - Clicker version 1\r
        \r
        * Starting from your previous
        clicker app and use a variable to store a click counter. \r
        * Declare and
        initialize your counter variable as a global variable\r
        * update your counter
        variable within the click event handler. \r
        * A textLabel can be updated
        on each click to output the click counter value along with a message. \r
        \r
        ####
        Enhancements\r
        \r
        There are lots of ways to enhance this app.  Here are
        some things you can do in no particular order...\r
        \r
        * Add a big image
        which can serve as a background image. If the player clicks on the background
        image they lose a point. \r
        * Add a button that lets the user start over
        - reset the score.\r
        * Add another image that jumps around randomly, or appears
        and disappears that the user can click\r
        * Use arithmetic to change how the
        score is calculated with each click (e.g. rather than losing a point for doing
        something wrong, divide the score by 2).  \r
        * Add more and different event
        handlers that alter the score in different ways.\r
        * Use arithmetic to change
        the size of the image you need to click based on the score.  For example,
        make the image smaller and smaller as the score gets higher.\r
        * Make the
        size of the image change to a random value each time\r
        * Make the score go
        up and down by a random value

        Sometimes you have lots of console log
        statments going on at once and its very difficult to tell which part of the
        code is printing each message. One strategy to deal with this is to name messages
        by putting some output in front of them. \r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        \r
        * **Run

        #
        Variable Reassignment\r
        \r
        So far we have seen a bunch of programs that
        create one variable and keep the value of that variable the same through out
        the program. However somtimes we want to change the value of the variable
        as the program executes. The rest of the levels in this progression are all
        about different ways we can change the variable as the program is running.
        \r
        \r
        The first and most important thing about variable reassignment is
        that when you want to change the value of the variable you don't say var
        in front of the name. This tells the computer "Go look for this variable
        in your memory because I already made it".   The computer will go look for
        the variable in memory and update its value for you.\r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        \r
        *
        **Starter Code:** We have started you off with a variable that changes value
        and a couple `console.log()` statements. \r
        \r
        * **Run the program** to
        see how variable reassignment works.\r
        \r
        * ** Change the values of the
        variable** to see how that changes the program.\r
        \r
        * ** Add another reassignment
        statement** at the end of the program in order to change the value a second
        time.

        The end result of
        an expression with variables is the same as one without.  The major difference
        is that values are retrieved from memory in order to do the calculation rather
        than simply hard-coded.\r

        # Mental Model Check\r

        in memory.\r

        style="float: right">\r
        When you have a statement like `result = 5 + 7;`
        realize that this **does NOT store a mathematical expression in the variable.**  \r
        \r
        Rather,
        with this instruction you are asking to compute 5 + 7 and **THEN** store the
        answer (a single number) in the variable.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        **GOAL:**
        the goal here is mostly to acquaint yourself with typing arithmetic expressions
        - the answers to the questions below are less important, and should be used
        as interesting things to investigate.  \r
        \r
        We've given you some **starting
        code** with 5 statements similar to ones in the table above.\r
        * **Add `console.log`
        or `write` statements** to display the values of each of the variables.\r
        *
        Experiment with arithmetic expressions, try to make really big and really
        small numbers.\r
        \r
        <hr>\r
        \r
        **Things to Try:**\r
        * Using **multiplication:
        what's the biggest a number you can store** in a variable?\r
         * How many
        digits are in the biggest number before it starts using scientific notation?\r
        *
        Using **subtraction (or multiplication with negative numbers): what's the
        lowest number you store?** (low means a negative number with a lot of digits)\r
        *
        Using **parentheses** make a crazy-big arithmetic expression.  \r
         * NOTE:
        composing arithmetic expressions is ***much* easier in text mode**, and is
        actually almost unreadable in block mode.  Try doing this in text mode.\r

        # Random
        Rotation\r
        \r
        Using random numbers with rotation can add interesting animation
        effects. One effect you can use rotation for is shaking. **An object can look
        like its shaking a little when you set its rotation to a small random number
        repeatedly.**\r

        # Do This\r
        You are going to start creating a spinner
        wheel similar to one you might find at a carnival. You set up the wheel on
        the last level so you are just adding the clicker at the top.\r
        \r
        * Create
        a clicker sprite.\r
        * Set the sprite to the provided clicker image.\r
        *
        Set the rotation to a random number between -5 and 5.\r
        * Test it out.

        # Getting Started with Your
        Digital Assistant\r

        style="width:200px;float:right;">\r
        Over the course of the next few lessons,
        you'll be __developing your own digital assistant__. To make your digital
        assistant more useful, it needs to be able to make __decisions__ based on
        questions the user asks it, and respond intelligently.\r
        \r
        To get started,
        __choose a topic__ you want your digital assistant to specialize in. It should
        be something you are interested in and know a lot about. Examples: Country
        Music, Sushi, College Football, Comedy Movies.\r
        \r
        You'll next set up
        the layout for your app. __The basic layout contains just two primary design
        elements:__ a text input and a text area.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        - __Choose
        a topic__ for your digital assistant to specialize in.\r
        - __Create the layout__
        for your app. Your digital assistant should have:\r
            - A name\r
            -
        A text input for the user to ask a question\r
            - A text area for the digital
        assistant to respond\r
            - The text area should have a greeting for the
        user (e.g. Ask me a question about movies!)\r
      U3 Digital Assistant Set Text_markdown_instruction: |-
        # Respond to Basic User
        Input\r
        \r

        style="width:200px;float:right;">\r
        Now you can have your digital assistant
        repeat what the user typed and add a __default response__. It's not the most
        intelligent response, but you'll build up to that over the next couple of
        lessons and it's important to build this program in pieces.  \r
        \r
        # Looking
        Back to Move Forward\r
        You're going to now add to your program without as
        much guidance as usual. Keep in mind that __this is very similar to programs
        you've already built__, so look back at your work for a refresher.\r
        - __Mad
        Libs:__ In Mad Libs you got a user's text when the 'Next' button was clicked,
        filled in the outline with the responses, and displayed the completed Mad
        Lib\r
        - __Introducing the 'change' event:__ You just learned about the
        'change' event that triggers when the user hits 'enter' on a text input.\r
        \r
        #
        Do This:\r
        - __Take the user's question and output it to the text area__
        when the 'enter' key is pressed in the text input\r
        - The response should
        also __include a default phrase__ such as _"I don't know about that yet!"_\r
        -
        __Format the response with newline characters__ to separate the user's response
        from the assistant's response.: `\n`\r
        - The __text input should clear__
        after the user hits 'enter'

        \r

        \r
        Now
        that you have a better sense of this lessons in this sequence, let’s think
        about the types of supports students will need in order to be successful.
        Since the curriculum is based on inquiry learning, lessons feature activities
        that engage students in discovering core concepts themselves. It’s important
        to think through implementation plans and student support. In this task you
        will make a plan for teaching and student support **for one of the lessons
        in this sequence** that takes into account differentiation strategies and
        make-up work for absent students. Your teaching and student support plan should
        cover the following: \r
        \r
        \r
        - **Which lesson in the sequence are you
        discussing?** \r
        \r
        - **Details on how you will implement and differentiate
        the lesson:**\r
        \r
         - An outline of any changes you will need to make to
        the lesson to fit your local constraints or context (for example: pacing and
        time, dealing with classroom setup, etc). \r
         - An overview of the types
        of student needs you’ll likely need to support in your classroom (for example:
        students who are struggling to understand the underlying concept; students
        who are already familiar with the concept, but still have room to learn more;
        etc)\r
         - Your plan for addressing each of the needs outlined above (for
        example: integrating extension activities or other materials for students
        who already know something about the topic)\r
         - How will you address or
        emphasize the connection between lessons in this sequence? \r
        \r
        - **Plan
        for catching up absent students:**\r
        \r
         - How will absent students catch
        up on activities they missed? \r
         - How will you use the fact that the lessons
        in this sequence are related and build on one another to address make-up work?

        Lessons 7 - 9: Teaching and Student Support Plan\r
        \r
        ## Task Description\r
        \r
        Now
        that you have a better sense of this lessons in this sequence, let’s think
        about the types of supports students will need in order to be successful.
        Since the curriculum is based on inquiry learning, lessons feature activities
        that engage students in discovering core concepts themselves. It’s important
        to think through implementation plans and student support. In this task you
        will make a plan for teaching and student support **for one of the lessons
        in this sequence** that takes into account differentiation strategies and
        make-up work for absent students. Your teaching and student support plan should
        cover the following: \r
        \r
        \r
        - **Which lesson in the sequence are you
        discussing?** \r
        \r
        - **Details on how you will implement and differentiate
        the lesson:**\r
        \r
         - An outline of any changes you will need to make to
        the lesson to fit your local constraints or context (for example: pacing and
        time, dealing with classroom setup, etc). \r
         - An overview of the types
        of student needs you’ll likely need to support in your classroom (for example:
        students who are struggling to understand the underlying concept; students
        who are already familiar with the concept, but still have room to learn more;
        etc)\r
         - Your plan for addressing each of the needs outlined above (for
        example: integrating extension activities or other materials for students
        who already know something about the topic)\r
         - How will you address or
        emphasize the connection between lessons in this sequence? \r
        \r
        - **Plan
        for catching up absent students:**\r
        \r
         - How will absent students catch
        up on activities they missed? \r
         - How will you use the fact that the lessons
        in this sequence are related and build on one another to address make-up work?
        \r
        \r
        You can type out your teaching and student support plan in the box
        below, or you can upload a word doc or pdf file. \r

        ## Getting Credit
        for Completing this Task\r
        \r
        #### Task Review Details\r
        \r
        If this module
        is listed as  your “focus area”, then your response to the prompt above will
        be shared anonymously and reviewed by your peers, and you will review the
        work done by other teachers. Reviewers will be looking for thoughtful and
        thorough answers that demonstrate that you have spent time considering how
        the lesson will play out in your own classroom. Reviewers will have an opportunity
        to give feedback on your submission, and you can respond to that feedback
        and resubmit. \r
        \r
        In order to get credit for completing this task, two
        reviewers need to agree that you have responded to the prompts fully. If reviewers
        don’t feel comfortable making a decision about your task submission, they
        can elevate to a facilitator to review. You will always have a chance to address
        feedback from your reviewers and resubmit your task! Reviewer feedback will
        show up at the bottom of this page, once it’s available. \r

        # Multiple Assignments\r
        \r
        A
        variable contains a single piece of information called its **value**. To use
        that value in a program you need an easy way to tell your program which variable
        to use. Each variable has a **label** or name to let you refer to it. In your
        last program, the variable had the label `size` and originally had a **value**
        of `10`. **Here's a summary of what each command does**\r

        Often
        you want to see the exact value contained in a variable, especially if it
        was randomly generated. Both `console.log` and `text` can be used with variables
        to specifically see their values. This is an important skill when **debugging**
        your programs.\r

        # Putting
        random numbers into variables\r
        We can also store things in variables besides
        hard-coded numbers. The whole point of variables is to use them as placeholders
        for values that might be different each time you run the program.\r
        \r
        Let's
        assign a random nubmer to a variable.  Sometimes you want to generate a randomNumber
        but then use that same number repeatedly - so you need to store the number
        that was generated and use it several times in the code.\r
        \r
        We can assign
        a variable the result of an expression, or in the case where a function returns
        a value, like randomNUmber.  For example:\r
        \r
        var randSize = randomNumber(5,30);\r

        In the programs we have seen so far the value of the
        variable stays the same through the whole program. You don't have to keep
        a variable the same value for the whole program. We can change its value as

        write will achieve the same thing as the previous level in fewer lines of
        code. \r

        Top-down design is design process and strategy for breaking

        your development process when writing code.  \r

        two distinct points in that process. Describe the difficulties and/or opportunities
        you encountered and how they were resolved or incorporated. In your description
        clearly indicate whether the development described was collaborative or independent.
        At least one of these points must refer to independent program development.

        \r
        1.
        (1 point) Do you describe a real *iterative* process for writing the *whole*
        program - "Incremental and iterative" means that you continuously improved
        your program based on testing, reflection, or feedback from a partner.\r
        \r
        2.
        (1 point) Do you actually describe *two* points in time while writing your
        code, what the specific issue was, and how you got past it by *reflecting*
        or *incorporating feedback* from a collaborative partner.\r

        either how you developed the idea for the snowflake drawing program, or how

        The
        abstraction I have identified draws a heart in the program.  The whole program
        draws a picture with turtle graphics that says "I [heart] CS" where the
        [heart] is actually a drawing of a heart shape. Because I am using the parameterized
        versions of these turtle functions it helps manage the complexity of the code.
        Without the parameters the drawing is achieve-able but would require many
        many more lines of code.  For example: the command to <code>arcRight(220,
        30)</code>  - which moves the turtle in a 220-degree arc with a 30-pixel radius
        - is possible to do with a long series of repeated <code>moveForward</code>,
        and <code>turnRight</code> commands, possibly hundreds. By using the <code>arcRight</code>
        command I encapsulate in one line what the code should be doing rather than

        # Make a Prediction - Learning
        to Code Better, Faster\r
        Research has shown that when you encounter a new
        piece of code you learn faster by simply **making a prediction about what
        will happen before you run the program**. It's not actually important if
        your prediction is correct, but the act of predicting allows you to construct
        a stronger mental model for how code works and then test your understanding
        when you run the code.\r
        \r
        Good programmers do this all the time. **They
        don't expect their code is correct the first time they write it.** Instead
        they get in the habit of running their code, checking their assumptions, and
        making changes as needed. Programming isn't a fixed set of steps. It's a
        creative and continuous cycle of writing, testing, and improving code.\r

        Predict - Observe - Reflect\r

        # Buttons and Unique IDs\r

        (we'll typically write **ID**) is a **unique identifier** for that element
        in the app.\r
        \r
        Each element that appears in the app must have a **unique
        ID**. In fact, if you try to run a program that has two buttons with same
        ID you will get a warning message in the console. Watch:\r

        the error message to show up. To get rid of that error message you will have
        to change the ID of the button from the default `id` to something else.\r
        \r
        **Error
        messages happen to everyone and they are helpful!**: getting an error or warning
        message when you run your program is *not a big deal*. Programmers actually
        rely on error messages to tell them where and how to fix their code.\r
        Sometimes
        error messages are bit cryptic: `WARNING: Line: 2: button() id parameter refers
        to an id (id) which already exists.` But a warning like this contains helpful
        information and clues such as the line the error occured on, or some word
        or command it didn't recognize. \r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        The goal here is to
        experience an error message in a program, study it, and fix it.\r
        * **Drag**
        two buttons into the workspace (same as shown above) with the default IDs.\r
        *
        **Run** the program to see the warning message in the console.\r
        * **Read**
        the warning message to see what it says.\r
        * **Change** the IDs of the buttons
        to make them unique. An ID must be specified in quotes. You can use double-quotes:
        `"myId"`, or single quotes: `'myId'`\r
        * **Re-run the program** to make
        sure you don't get the error.\r
        \r

        The

        same amount every time (25 pixels in fact). Similarly, `turnLeft()` turns
        the turtle to the left exactly 90 degrees. Today we are going to see how some
        functions can **accept input**, such as a number, to more exactly control
        behavior. For example, you can write `moveForward(103)` to move the turtle
        exactly 103 pixels if you like.\r

        # Terminology: *Parameter*\r
        \r
        When
        you have a command like: `moveForward(100)` we say that the `moveForward()`
        command *accepts a **parameter***.  And 100 is the value *given* or *supplied*
        to `moveForward()`'s **parameter**.  Since this value can change, you will
        often see a written description for the command that looks something like
        **`moveForward(pixels)`** to indicate that the value supplied to `moveForward()`'s
        **parameter** should be the number of pixels you want it move.\r
        \r
        The
        good old `moveForward()` command still exists.  In fact it's the **same command**
        as `moveForward(pixels)`. The "parameter-less" version of `moveForward()`
        simply supplies a **default value** to the parameter.  We might also say that
        the `moveForward()` command has an **optional parameter** since you could
        call either `moveForward()` or `moveForward(50)` and it doesn't cause an
        error when you run the program.\r
        \r
        NOTE: you can write your own functions
        that accept parameters, too!  But we'll get to that in later lessons.\r

        # More New Commands: Color and Width\r
        \r
        Two powerful new
        commands have been added to the toolbox, `penColor()` and `penWidth()`. \r
        \r
        **Read
        the documentation:** Read through the documentation for `penColor()` and `penWidth()`
        which let you set the color and size of the pen your turtle uses to draw.
        The documentation for `penColor()` has a lot in it!  For now just look at
        the **named colors**, things like "red", "green", etc.  Don't worry,
        you'll get a lot of opportunities to practice with colors in a variety of
        ways.  We're just getting started!\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        **Draw the square:**
        Use pen color and width functions to draw the thick blue square shown below.  The
        size of the square doesn't matter.\r

        # Drawing with Dots\r
        \r
        We've
        added a new command called `dot()`.  \r
        \r
        **Read the documentation** for
        the `dot()` command.\r
        \r
        **Make a "snowman"**\r
        \r
        1. Set the pen color
        to some new color (we made ours pink)\r
        \t* Note: even if you just want the
        default dot color - black - explicitly set the color to black here.\r
        \r
        2.
        Using that color, make a dot so big that it fills the screen.\r
        \r
        3. In
        a different color, make 3 dots in a row, each one smaller than the next. (We
        made our dots white to look like a snowman)\r

        In

        colors in the **hexadecimal format (e.g. "#AC9100")**. Colors on websites
        will often be represented in this format. It's useful to know how to interpret
        and use this format when trying  to duplicate colors in your own images.\r

        There is another command that lets you set
        the pen color called `penRGB(r,g,b,a)`.\r
        \r
        * The first 3 parameters are
        for values (in the range 0-255) for the red, green, and blue channels. \r
        *
        The 4th parameter `a` stands for "alpha".  The "alpha channel" for color
        lets you set the level of **opacity** as a decimal value between 0 and 1 -
        it is interpreted as a percentage, so 0.5 equates to 50% opaque.  For example:
        `penRGB(113, 102, 160, 0.5)`.\r

        # Moving Relative to the
        Screen\r
        \r
        The turtle commands we've seen so far move the turtle **relative
        to the turtle's location and direction**. If you want to get the turtle to
        a specific position on the screen using only `moveForward()` or `turnLeft()`,
        you need to know the turtle's location beforehand.\r
        \r
        Two new commands
        in the toolbox help resolve this issue. `moveTo()` moves the turtle to a location
        on the screen based on its X and Y coordinates. `turnTo()` turns the turtle
        in a specific direction. Together these commands can make many drawings easier
        to complete.\r

        Code you write
        will always be based upon the commands that are provided by the programming
        language you are using. When several commands are provided in a logical chunk,
        like the set of turtle commands, we refer to them collectively as a **library**
        of functions. The total set of commands that a language provides access to
        is called the **application program interface**, or simply an **API**. \r
        \r

        If you add some randomness to
        turtle behavior inside a loop, the program will run a little differently every
        time which can make for some cool effects.\r
        \r
        You're about to see a program
        in which the turtle **moves to a random location** each iteration of the loop,
        and **draws a randomly-sized dot** that also has a **random color**.  We've

        `drawSeaStar` has a portion of code that uses a longer sequence of repetitious
        single commands.  \r

        At this point
        you've seen how parameters can help **generalize the behavior of a function**
        to perform a variety of tasks, not just one. This will prove to be a very
        useful skill as we continue to develop as programmers.\r
        \r
        For now, **keep
        adding to your drawing**. Make more function calls and see if you can continue
        to use **random numbers** to add variety to your drawings.\r

        \r
        Notice that these functions accept the same **value** when
        they're called but they give them **different names**. Each function can
        decide what it will call its parameters. Even if one function calls another,
        **each function is treated as a separate logical unit of code.** In fact,
        you **could name their parameters** the same, but they would still be separate
        blocks of code.\r
        \r
        In programming we call these blocks of code the **scope**
        of the function. It is a complex concept but one that will eventually make
        programming a much simpler process. The benefit of each function being able
        to name its own parameters is that you only need to look at that function
        to know which parameters it is using and what they are called.\r

        # Simulating Coin Flips\r
        \r
        Over
        the next several exercises we are going to be building a program that simulates
        flipping 10,000 coins, or even more if you like. Along the way we're going
        to be keeping track of the patterns that develop and hopefully learning something
        about the patterns that develop.\r
        \r
        This is a great problem to simulate
        on a computer. If you wanted to flip 10 coins you'd probably just do it by
        hand. Flipping 10,000 coins would take significantly longer (about 3 hours
        if you flip one per second) and so **we'd much rather use a program to do
        the work for us.** Not only is it a lot faster to write the program, but once
        you're done you can run your program over and over, repeating the experiment.
        As we'll see, **simulations like this make it much easier to quickly notice
        patterns, test hypotheses, and develop new ideas to investigate**.\r
        \r
        **Starting
        Small:** Our simulations are going to start small. We'll actually only be
        flipping 10 coins to begin with, and then developing programs that keep track
        of patterns in this smaller set of data. That way we'll be able to visually
        confirm that our programs are working as intended. **Once we've verified
        that our programs work at a smaller scale we'll gradually increaese the number
        of flips our program is working on until we're at the full 10,000.**\r

        # Choosing Good IDs\r

        style="float: right">**Good IDs** are **meaningful and descriptive**.\r
        Just
        like good names for functions, you will want an ID to describe the intended
        purpose of the element.  For example, if you have many buttons in your program,
        you will want to give each an ID that describes what the button does. For
        example "forwardButton", "leftButton", etc.\r
        \r
        **IDs are also case-sensitive**
        which means you'll want to develop a style for capitalizing IDs. A common
        strategy is to use a style called **camelcase**.  In camelcase style, words
        are combined together with no spaces and each new word, after the first, is
        capitalized. itTypicallyLooksLikeThis.  \r
        \r
        **Why?** Many computer systems
        do not allow keywords like function names and IDs to contain spaces.  You've
        already seen several examples like this: `moveForward`, `onEvent`, `turnLeft`,
        etc.  It's important to realize that camelcase is a style convention, not
        a hard and fast rule. Sometimes you'll see other styles such as using underscores:
        `move_forward`, `turn_left`.  But in App Lab we typically use camelcase.\r
        \r
        #
        Rules About IDs\r
        In making descriptive and meaningful IDs there **are some
        rules about IDs** you need to know.  IDs...\r
        * cannot contain spaces.\r
        *
        *must* begin with a letter (A-Z or a-z) and may be followed by any number
        of digits and letters.\r
        * can contain hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"),
        colons (":"), or periods (".").\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        The code you will
        begin with has an error. If you run it, you'll see that the ID of the button
        and the event handler don't match.\r
        \r
        * **Improve ** the button ID by
        choosing a **descriptive and meaningful** ID.\r
        * **Change ** the event handler
        so that it correctly references the button by its new ID.\r
        * **Run ** the
        program to make sure it works.\r

        **Debugging:** As you write more complex event-driven programs,

        and correcting errors within a program. It is a critical (and generally unavoidable)
        step when writing code.<img src="https://images.code.org/b5d00d8027dae463eebb7f1c079cb2e2-image-1444156708725.gif"

        \r
        **Debug
        the problem**:\r
        In each problem, we've added various errors into the program
        and it does not work as intended. You will need to find the errors, debug
        the problems, and make corrections such that the program works correctly.\r
        \r
        **Checking
        IDs:** Your first debugging task will be to verify that the button IDs match
        the event-handlers. **Remember that IDs are case-sensitive**.\r

        comes before your object (in this case a button) your computer would be looking

        # How Do Events Work?\r
        Event-driven
        apps are made up of elements that can trigger events (such as buttons) and
        pieces of code called **event handlers**. Event handlers are commands that
        "watch" for certain events to occur in your program, and then run some function
        when an event occurs.\r
        \r
        <img src="https://images.code.org/96abf7d54a0be221a8b8eda80c696bf4-image-1444142010683.png"
        style="float: right; width: 250px">The `onEvent(id, type, callback)` command
        creates an **event handler** in your app. The three parameters are:\r
        * **id**
        - the ID of the element in the app you want to "watch", one that might trigger
        an event\r
        * **type** - the type of event to "watch" for (e.g. a click,
        a key press, a mousemove, etc.)\r
        * **callback** - a **callback function**
        is only different from a normal function in that you don't call it directly
        from your code. Instead it gets *called by the system at the time the specified
        event occurs*. You put the code into this function just like you would any
        other, and it will run when the event occurs.\r
        \r
        Once created, the event
        handler will always "watch" that element as long as it exists. \r
        \r
        #
        Do This:\r
        The program you are going to see has a button with a new ID but
        no event handler that is attached to it.\r
        * **Add an `onEvent` handler**
        that watches for a click on the button and *moves the turtle forward* when
        it happens. \r
        * **Run the program** to make sure it works.\r
        * **Try changing
        the event type** to something like "mouseover" and see what happens.  Not
        all event types will work with buttons but it's fun to play a little bit.\r

        # Other Ways to Assign
        Values to Variables\r
        Programs become much more interesting when the values
        in variables change while the program is running. We can also assign to a
        variable the value returned by a function. For example:\r
        \r
        ![](https://images.code.org/31447c1b90c925bba3ca86ead8d84a7d-image-1445892065474.png)\r
        \r
        Because
        the `randomNumber` function *evaluates to a number* it means we can treat
        it *as though it were a number*. We've used it before by just "plugging
        it in" to some function that needed a number as a parameter like:\r
        ![](https://images.code.org/5df0376d562bd75a1899e17c49b00144-image-1445941026356.png)\r
        \r
        Because
        the `randomNumber` function generates a new and different number each time
        you call it, one thing we *could not* do before we had variables was generate
        a random number, and use that *same number* for two different things in a
        program. Now we can.\r
        \r

        style="float: right; width: 350px">Write a program that simulates the rolling
        of two dice and reports their individual values as well as the sum. \r

        each result in its own variable.\r
        * Display the individual values of the
        two dice.\r

        `var userInput = promptNum("Enter a number?")`\r

        `promptNum`

        number*. The difference here is that promptNum pops up an input dialog box
        and waits for the user to type a number.  Once they do and hit 'Ok' the
        number they typed is returned and we can store it in a variable to use in

        it's typically used as a way to get a value from the user that you want to
        hold on to while the program runs.\r
        \r
        `promptNum` is similar to `randomNumber`
        in that it is a function whose return value *evaluates to a number*. The difference
        here is that `promptNum` pops up an input dialog box and waits for the user
        to type a number.  Once they do and hit "OK" the number they typed is returned
        and we can store it in a variable to use in our programs.\r
        \r
        \r

        # Variable Re-assignment
        - Part 2: Updating Values\r
        \r
        All of our examples so far have shown how
        to set the value of a variable by using combinations of numbers and other
        variables.  But what if you wanted to do something like **add 10 to the *current*
        value of a variable**? \r
        \r
        Because updating the value in a variable is
        just moving memory around, the process has to go something like this:\r
        *
        Read the current value of a variable.\r
        * Add 10 to it.\r
        * Store the new
        value back into the same variable.\r
        \r
        The technical term for this is called
        **variable re-assignment** - when you change the value of a variable based
        on its current contents.   To increase the value of `num1` by 10 you actually
        need to do this:\r
        \r
        <img src="https://images.code.org/c49b1a0fb81de4b90558fdb278e40987-image-1445942169121.png"
        style="float:right">\r
        ```\r
        num1 = num1 + 10;\r
        ```\r
        The diagram at
        right shows a picture of what's happening (it assumes the value of `num1`
        is 7 before the line is executed).  It's actually very similar to what happens
        with plain old arithmetic: compute a value, then store it in a variable.  Because
        the computation has to happen before storing the result in a variable, there
        is no contradiction here.\r

        \r
        <h3>\r
        Mistake 1\r
        </h3>\r
        <p>To
        increase the value of variable by 10 (for example) a common mistake is to
        think that this statement alone will do the trick.\r
        </p><p>\r
        \r
        ```\r
        num1
        + 10;\r
        ```\r
        </p><p>\r
        It doesn't. This tells the computer to add 10
        to whatever the value of `num1` is.  And the computer will do that, and the
        result will go....nowhere.  It will be lost.\r
        </p><p>\r
        Because you are
        trying assign a new value to a variable it should make sense that **the =
        sign must be involved somehow**.  \r
        </p>\r
        <h3>\r
        Mistake 2\r
        </h3>\r
        <p>\r
        If
        you were in math class this statment would make no sense:\r
        ```\r
        num1 =
        num1 + 10;\r
        ```\r
        </p><p>\r
        But **remember to read = as "gets."** If
        you read the statement above as: "num1 *gets* the value of num1's current
        value plus 10" it might make more sense.  Get in the habit of using "gets."\r

        # Text and Variables Living
        Together!\r
        \r
        Sometimes it’s useful to display text along with the value
        of a variable in the same line of output. To do this you use `+` to attach
        a variable onto a literal string of characters.  Here is an example:\r
        \r
        <img
        src="https://images.code.org/a35e68b062fc814871a8323938cf3384-image-1445888147995.png"
        style="border: solid 1px #BBBBBB; height: 30px;">\r
        \r
        Notice that the
        `+` operator has **two different meanings in JavaScript depending on what
        type of data you're applying it to**. Click the explanations below for more
        details.\r
        \r
        <details>\r
        <summary>If **both operands are numbers** `+`
        means to add those two numbers together.</summary>\r
        \r
        This is standard
        addition.  It works both with numbers and with variables that contain numbers,
        as shown below.<br>\r
        \r
        <img src="https://images.code.org/eb50a1fcea459fe74774d903b07a274f-image-1445887814602.png"
        style="border: solid 1px #BBBBBB; height: 30px;"><br>\r
        \r
        Because `num1`
        is a variable that holds a number, and 10 itself is obviously a number, in
        this case `+` will do addition like you would expect.\r
        \r
        </details>\r
        <br>\r
        <details>\r
        <summary>If
        **either of the operands is a string** `+` treats both as if they were strings
        and combines them to create a single string.</summary>\r
        This is potentially
        confusing behavior and can get pretty weird if the text *looks* like numbers.  For
        example, this code will display **16100** to the screen.<br>\r
        \r
        <img src="https://images.code.org/a9c54b664bd192aa5bf611808d88a3bc-image-1445887893598.png"
        style="border: solid 1px #BBBBBB; height: 30px;"><br>\r
        \r
        Why? Because
        JavaScript sees you trying to display a mix of text and variable values. "16"
        (in quotes) is a string of ASCII characters not a number.  And so JavaScript
        converts everything to text, and the characters in the result of "16"+"100"
        comes out to "16100". \r
        \r
        </details>\r
        <br>\r
         \r
        **TIP:** It's
        common to want to sandwich a variable between some text when displaying it.  You
        can string together multiple pieces of text and variables using the `+` operator.  For
        example, you can do this:\r
        <br> \r
        \r
        <img src="https://images.code.org/65b0e277f058903bd3b956cc59ee5253-image-1445887976271.png"
        style="border: solid 1px #BBBBBB; height: 30px;"><br>\r

        <br>\r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**Misconception
        Alert**</summary>\r
        \r
        The **key thing to understand** about the `+` symbol
        is that it can _only_ do actual arithmetic addition if the values on either
        side of the `+` are actually numbers or variables that contain numbers. \r
        \r
        **And**
        if the `+` symbol cannot determine whether the value is a number then it **assumes
        it's a string**, and converts everything to a string and tries to concatenate
        it.  \r
         \r
        The computer relies on you - the programmer - to make sure that
        the **type of data** stored in a variable is appropriate for the task at hand.\r
        </details><br>\r
        \r
        On
        the next screen we'll have you play with this a little bit, but you'll write
        statements to display a mix of text and strings from here on out.\r
        \r
        #
        Do This:\r
        We have given you the starting code shown below.  You should **modify**
        the `write` statement on **line 3** to combine text and variables together

      U3L15 - Add reset button to UpDown app_markdown_instruction: |-
        # Add a Reset
        Button\r
        In most apps you want to provide a way to start over. \r
        \r
        To
        do this without having the user quit and restart your app, you need to add
        code to **reset variables and text displays to initial values** so the app
        can effectively start over.\r
        \r
        We've **added a button** to the "gameOverScreen"
        in the *Count Up/Down App* and **added an empty event handler** for it.  \r
        \r
        Right
        now clicking the "start over" button does nothing. You will write code to
        make it work.\r
        \r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        **Add code to the startOverButton event
        handler to reset the app**.  <img src="https://images.code.org/cb1569accb6a370d2258b5b14d624424-image-1446126849891.gif"
        style="width: 150px; float: right;">\r
        \r
        The app should work like the
        animation shown to the right. **Notice** that when the "start over" button
        is clicked it goes back to the main screen and  the count has been reset to
        0. \r
        \r
        The code should:\r
        \r
        * Set the screen to the gamePlayScreen.\r
        *
        Set the count variable to 0.\r
        * Set the correct text label on the gamePlayScreen
        to show the count is 0.\r
        \r
        Once you get it to work, move on.

        This app demontrates a few new
        concepts.  We'll step through each one, one at a time, explaining how each
        thing works.  Along the way, we'll also encounter some common challenges,
        and learn how to solve them.\r

        # Do This:\r
        * Keeping clicking the up

        The *Count Up/Down App* has a bug! \r
        \r
        A ** common

        about the common mistake here...</strong></big> [click to expand]</summary>\r
        <br><br>\r
        <strong><big>...forgetting
        to reset <i>everything</i> you need to actually start over.</big></strong><br><br>\r
        Frequently
        to actually reset you need to set a few variables back to initial values <i>and</i>
        update all the UI components, especially those that rely on those variables,
        so they reflect the new values.<br><br>\r
        \r
        Another common mistake shown
        here is setting the text of a label to "0" rather than the value of the
        count variable.  For example, these two lines of code are a little dangerous:<br><br>\r
        <pre>\r
        count
        = 0;\r
        setText("countDisplayLabel", 0);\r
        </pre>\r
        \r
        To be safe, if
        a label is supposed to display the value of a variable, you should always
        use the variable <i>instead of hard-coding numbers</i> as a check on yourself.  The
        general rule of thumb is: never hard-code a value instead of using a variable
        that holds the value you need to show.<br><br>\r
        \r
        <b>A common strategy</b>
        for handling this is to put everything you need to reset the app into a function
        which you can call at both the beginning of your program, and from other screens
        later on.  For example:<br><br>\r
        \r
        <pre>\r
        function resetAll(){\r
          count
        = 0;\r
          setText("countDisplayLabel", count);\r
          setScreen("gamePlayScreen");\r
        }\r
        </pre>\r
        \r
        Then
        in some other code like a button event handler you can just call your reset
        \r
        function:<br><br>\r
        \r
        <pre>\r
        onEvent("startOverButton", "click",
        \r
        function() {\r
          <span style="background-color:yellow">resetAll();</span>\r
        });\r

        This problem was probably easy to see here,
        but in practice <b>logic errors</b> like this can be devilish to track down.
        It's especially hard because the program gives you no hints that anything
        is wrong - it is syntactially a correct program. The computer cannot tell
        ahead of time whether your `if` statements will ever be true. So you need
        to trace through the logic of your program step by step to try to figure out
        why something's not happening that you expect should have happened.\r

        \r
        The
        *Count Up/Down App* has a bug! \r
        \r
        A **very common mistake** has been
        introduced into the code.  It's one that vexes early programmers, but we're
        sure you'll find it.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        * **Run the program.**\r
        \r
        *
        **To see the bug:**\r
         * Click the up arrow just once.\r
         * Restart the
        program.\r
         * Click the down arrow just once.\r
         \r
        * **Look at the code
        and fix the problem.**\r
        \r
        * **Read about the common mistake** by expanding
        the area below.\r
        \r
        * **Once you've fixed the issue, move on.**\r

        <strong><big>...using
        `=` instead of `==`</big></strong>\r
        <p>\r
        <b>Yup,</b> we told you this
        is a common mistake!  And it's an easy one to make.\r
        </p>\r
        <p>\r
        Remember
        that the single `=` sign does assignment and it actually *also* evaluates
        to true.  This means that if you stick it in an `if` statement, that `if`
        statement will <i>always</i> be true.\r
        </p>\r
        <p>\r
        One strategy to avoid
        this mistake is to **read code aloud in your head** and don't even use the
        single word "equal":\r
        <li> think **"gets"** every time you see `=`</li>\r
        <li>
        think **"equal-equal"** every time you see `==` </li>\r
        </p>\r
        <p>\r
        If
        you get in the habit of thinking that way, these mistakes are easier to catch.  For
        example you'd see this:<br>\r
        `if (count = 20)`<br>\r
        and read:<br>\r
        <i>"if
        count gets 20"</i> ...and know that that doesn't make sense.\r

        \r
        We've
        **modified** the *Count Up/Down App* to add another screen.  When the count
        reaches certain values, we'll switch screens.  In the code you'll see an
        `if` statement has been added to the event handler for up arrow that states:\r

        # Do This:\r
        **Add an `if` statement
        so that when counting down the app changes screens when the count reaches
        -5. **\r
        \r
        * **Run the app** and click the up arrow 20 times to see what
        happens when the `if` statement is triggered.\r
        * **Study the `if` statement**
        for the up arrow button to see how it works.\r

        to the down arrow event handler:\r
        \t* **If** `count` is equal to **-5, then**
        set the screen to the "gameOverScreen."\r
        * **Goal:** Once you're finished,
        clicking the down arrow in the app should work like the animation shown to
        the right.\r

        <details><summary><strong><big>HINT:</big></strong> [click

        <p>\r
        </p>\r
        <b>NOTE:</b>
        Your code can call `setText` for any UI element, on any screen, at any time
        - even if the element isn't on the screen that's currently showing.\r

        Misconception Alert - Changing a Variable Doesn't Change the Display</h1>\r
        \r
        A
        common misunderstanding about variables and displaying them is to think that
        a text label that's displaying a variable will change when the variable changes.
        NO.  A text label is just "dumb" container for text.  It's similar to a
        variable itself in that it won't change unless you explicitly tell it to.\r
        <p></p>\r
        <h1>Concept:
        Separation of Program Data from How It's Viewed</h1>\r
        Maintaining variables
        and program data is a **different task** from maintaining the display of the
        app.  Your program could actually run without updating the display at all
        - it would still be working behind the scenes; it just wouldn't be very fun
        or interesting to use.\r

        \r
        1. **Run this app, which works properly.**\r
         * Study the code

        You

        These double quotes **are not part of the string**. Instead this is how you

        now we'll need a way to access that text**. In order to do that you'll need

        You can use a `getText` command just
        like a string within a `console.log` or `write` command. Just like with `setText`
        you will refer to the UI element by its ID.\r

        # How to Organize the Code\r
        As
        your apps get more complex you'll have to think about how to organize your
        code so it remains readable and easy for you to locate things when debugging
        any problems.  We suggest the following convention which breaks the code into
        3 major sections:\r
        * **Top**:  code for UI elements **and** any code for
        positioning them.\r
        * **Middle**: code for event handlers.\r
        * **Bottom**:
        code for any other other functions you've written. (We don't have any of
        these yet.)\r
        \r
        So if you have some existing code and want to insert a
        `setPosition` command, you should place it after `button` but before `onEvent`
        in the code, like this:\r
        \r
        <img src="https://images.code.org/ae17e62c077aa9698526371d22db1307-image-1448404255046.gif"

        \r
        * **Starter code** has been provided
        which creates two buttons and event handlers.\r
        * **Insert** `setPosition`
        commands for each button so they appear at the bottom of the screen (as shown).\r
          *
        **Remember:** in an app screen 0,0 is the top left corner and you specify
        a location by how many pixels from the left and how many down from the top
        of the screen it is.  The screen is **320 by 450 pixels**.

        # Strings\r
        \r
        The primary data
        type we have used so far is **Numbers**. If we want to interact with user-submitted
        text, however, we'll need to learn about a new data type called a **String**.  A
        string is a **sequence of ASCII characters**.\r
        \r
        **Example** | **Rule**\r
        ---|---\r
        `"aString"`
        | Strings **might** look a lot like a variable name but there are **many differences**.\r
        `"look
        at all these spaces"` | Strings can **contain spaces**.\r
        `"$2 bills are
        the coolest"` | Strings can **contain special characters** (and even start
        with them).\r
        `"11"` | Strings might **contain only digits**. This looks
        like a number but it is really 2 ASCII characters.\r
        `""` | Strings might
        **contain no characters**.\r
        <br>\r
        You can **store strings in a variable
        just like a number**. In this example the variable name is `str` but you should
        choose a name that is **descriptive and meaningful**.\r
        \r

        \r
        **Combining Strings:** often you will want to combine multiple
        strings to create one longer string. You can do this with the `+` operator.
        The formal name of this process is **concatenation**.\r
        \r
        The program you're
        about to see is a very simple Mad Libs app that uses strings that are created
        inside the program and  saved inside of variables. These strings are then
        **concatenated** with other strings to create a Mad Lib.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        *
        The input words of this Mad Lib are **currently set to the empty string**.\r
        *
        **Add your own input words** and run the program to generate the Mad Lib.

        button itself moves every time you click it**.\r

        so that **it no longer moves the turtle** but instead sets the position of
        the button itself to a random location on the screen.\r
        \t* TIP: add `setPosition`
        to the event handler, and just move the `randomNumber` calls from the turtle.\r

        # Strings vs. Numbers\r
        \r
        Some
        strings only contain numeric digits (e.g. `"512"`) in which case they look
        a lot like numbers. In some languages strings cannot be treated as numbers,
        but there are instances in JavaScript where **a number will be treated like
        a string or a string will be treated like a number**. This can cause unexpected
        behavior, so it's good to see these instance beforehand.\r
        \r
        The most
        frequent instances you will see number or strings treated like the other type
        is when using **arithmetic operators** (addition, substraction, multiplication,
        division).\r
        \r
        * **Addition:** If either of the values is a string then
        this will be treated as **string concatenation**. Only when both values are
        numbers will it be treated as normal addition.\r
            * "2" + 3 --> "23"\r
            *
        2 + 3 --> 5\r
            * 2 + "a" --> "2a"\r
        * **Multiplication/Division/Subtraction:**
        Since this operation does not exist for strings then **all values with these
        operations will be converted to numbers** if possible.\r
        \t* "8" * "2"
        --> 16\r
            * "8" / 2 --> 4\r
            * 8 - "a" --> NaN (an error)\r
          \r
        **Note:
        In almost all instances you will not want to use the functionality we are
        exploring here. It is important to be aware of it for debugging purposes**\r

        The UI controls toolbox contains an element called
        `textLabel`. A text label is what it sounds like: plain text that you can
        put in your app. Even though it's just plain text you can still move and
        resize it using `setPosition`, and you can attach event handlers to it as
        well.\r
        \r
        **NOTE:** resizing a text label does not change the font size
        of the text.  We'll learn how to do that later.  \r

        * **Tip:**
        If you reuse your button's ID you'll only need to change a single line of

        \r
        In order to increment a key value pair you must first know what

        # Reading from Key Value Pairs\r
        \r
        So
        far we have focused on how to create and update key value pairs. Now we will
        learn how to read from them.\r
        \r
        `getKeyValue` can be used to read the
        value stored in a key value pair. The value is actually returned to your program
        as **a parameter of the callback function**. This actually makes sense since
        you should only be able to use the value retrieved from the server once you've
        actually received a response. As a result **any code that uses the value read
        from a key value pair must appear in the callback function**.\r
        \r

        PM.png)\r
        \r
        In the example you are about to see `getKeyValue` is used to
        read from two key value pairs. The first demonstrates how to use the parameter
        from the callback function to access the returned value. **You can name the
        value returned in the callback function anything you want**.\r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        \r
        *
        Using the starter code to guide you, **add code to the callback function**
        of the second `getKeyValue` command to log the value stored in `userScore`,
        as in the example below.\r

        Making
        requests to a remote server makes sequencing a set of commands more challenging,
        if not impossible. In order to address this issue the data commands include
        **an optional third parameter** called a **callback function**. A callback
        function is a function which **will run only after you've received confirmation
        from the server that it has received a request.**\r

        The program you are

        value pair, called `predictableBit`. Currently we cannot predict the sequence
        in which the commands will run, but if we use the **callback functions** each
        now includes we can. \r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        \r
        * **Alter the program** so that

        of the first, as in the image below.\r
        * **Run the program multiple times**
        and check the results in the **Data Viewer** to ensure that the requests are

        # Variable Reassignment
        - Part 1\r
        \r
        So far we have only set a variable's value once.  But it's
        called a *variable* for a reason - its value can change (or vary) throughout
        a program. This is useful and necessary for keeping track of things like a
        score in a game.\r
        \r
        To re-assign a value to a variable all you have to
        do is maintain the mental model of what's happening:\r
        \r
         * Variables
        are containers for information.\r
         * The `=` sign is an instruction to set
        the value.\r
         * A series of assignment statements (see example to right)
        is a list of instructions to execute one at a time - it's not a series of
        equations that define the state of the world.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r

        style="float: right">\r
        \r
         * **Make a prediction.**\r
        \r
         The code
        on the following screen looks like what is shown at right.  Study it and make
        a prediction about what will happen when you run the code. What will the values
        of `a` and `b` be at the end of the program?\r
        \r
        * **Add `console.log`
        statements.** \r
        \r
         Prove it to yourself by adding `console.log` statements
        at the end of the program to find out what the value of `a` and  `b` are.\r

        \r
        * **NOTICE:** in the code above, after the variable `a` has been created
        using `var`, to change a variable's value, you only need to refer to the
        variable by its name. The word `var` only needs to be used once - when the
        variable is created for the first time. \r
        \r
        * It's a **common mistake**
        to use `var` everytime you want to *use* a variable but just **remember `var`
        means CREATE a new variable**.  When you create a new variable it will lose
        its old value.  We'll look at errors related to this later.\r

        # What happened last
        level?\r
        \r
        In JavaScript you should just think of the word var as shorthand
        for "create a variable". In fact in the case of the last level the program
        thinks you want another variable names foo. This is the result of **scope**.
        \r
        \r
        There are two types of variables:\r
        \r
        1. **Gloabl Variables** -
        Created outside of all functions and can be seen and updated by any code.\r
        1.
        **Local Variables** - Create inside of a function and can't be seen by any
        other code. They get created when the function is run, and they get destroyed
        (seriously) when last line of code in the function has executed. If the function
        gets run again, then the variable is created again.\r
        \r
        So if you say `var`
        in front of a variable with the same name as a global variable it actually
        thinks you want another variable named foo just for this function!\r

      U3L19 - variable reassignment part 1_markdown_instruction: |
        # Variable Reassignment
        part 1\r
        \r
        So far we have only set a variable's value once.  But it's
        called a *variable* for a reason - its value can change (or vary) throughout
        a program. This is useful and necessary for keeping track of things like a
        score in a game.\r
        \r
        To re-assign a value to a variable all you have to
        do is maintain the mental model of what's happening:\r
        \r
         * Variables
        are containers for information\r
         * The '=' sign is an instruction to set
        the value.\r
         * A series of assignment statements (see example to right)
        is a list of instructions to execute one at a time - it's not a series of
        equations that define the state of the world.\r
        \r

        style="float: right">\r
        \r
         * **Make a prediction**\r
        \r
         The code on
        the following screen looks like what is shown at right.  Study it rigth and
        now and make a prediction about what will happen when you run the code. What
        will the values of `a` and `b` be at the end of the program?\r
        \r
        * **Add
        console.log statements** \r
        \r
         Prove it to yourself by adding `console.log`
        statements at the end of the program to find out what the value of a and b
        are.\r
         \r
        * **NOTICE:** in the code above, after the variable `a` has been
        created using `var`, to change  only need to refer to the variable by its
        name.  The word `var` only needs to be used once - when the variable is created
        for the first time. \r
        \r
        * It's a **common mistake** to use `var` everytime
        you want to *use* a variable but just **remember `var` means CREATE a new
        variable**.  When you create a new variable it will lose its old value.  We'll
        look at errors related to this later.\r

        So far the digital assistant you created responds with
        the same message no matter what the user types. Let's look at how to make
        the digital assistant smarter. Let's work on creating a Movie Bot example
        before returning to your digital assistant.\r
        \r
        In the last lesson we learned
        about `if`, `else-if`, and `else` statements. These allow us to make decisions.
        In the digital assistant we want to make decisions based on keywords. **The
        first keywords we want the Movie Bot to respond to are the movie genres: comedy,
        romance, action, and horror. **\r
        \r
        **Note: ** Check out the flowchart
        below to see the logic we are trying to add. The current portions of the diagram
        that we are creating are <mark>highlighted in yellow</mark>.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        *
        **Run the code** to understand what it does.\r
        \r
        * **Add `else-if` statements**
        to the `if` to check if the word the user typed matches **action, romance
        and horror**.  **Note:** Movie Bot will only understand input in the form
        of "comedy" not "Comedy" or "What is a comedy?" \r
        \r
        * **Add an `else`
        statement** to print a default answer for any other input.\r

        So far, the digital assisant
        doesn't do much. We'll need to start building up a conversation between
        the user and the digital assistant. Do the tasks for the next several levels
        inside the `generateResponse` function.\r

        <details>\r
        <summary>**Tips
        of the trade (click)**</summary>\r
        The event handler should only handle an
        event and the actions directly related to it. Everything that is involved
        in the running of the application (such as storing the user's input inside
        a variable), should be abstracted into a different function (i.e. `generateResponse`).
        If that function starts to get complicated, you should create a *helper function*
        to help abstract some of the complexity.\r
        </details>\r
        \r
        ### Instructions:\r

        will want your digital assistant to display both the user's question as well
        as its own response. How can we build a question-answer conversation?\r
        \r
        ###
        Instructions\r
        \r
        * Use string concatenation to build up the conversation
        variable\r
        * The user's input should be stored as `User: <input>`\r
        * The
        assistant's answer should be stored as `<name>: <default response>`\r
        *
        Once these phrases have been added to the conversation variable, log the variable
        to the console\r
        \r

        If the
        user asks "What color is the sky?" and my assistant's name is "Bot" and
        its default response is "I don't know.", the conversation variable should
        log<br/><br/>\r
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;User: What color is the sky?Bot: I don't
        know.\r
        <br/><br/>\r

        variables.</li>\r
        <li>If you want to *append* a string to another string,
        you can type `existingString = existingString + "appended string";`</li>\r

        \r
        After
        the use types a prompt and hits "enter/return", the prompt should disappear
        from the `text_input` element; otherwise, the user will have to erase the
        input every time s/he types a prompt.\r
        \r
        * Add one block to the end of
        your event handler that will clear the `text_input`\r
        \r

      U3L23 Chatbot Intro 3_markdown_instruction: |-
        You have now displayed the user's
        input on the screen, but it is all scrunched together. In this level, we will
        add some nicer formatting by using the newline character.\r
        \r
        ### Instructions\r
        \r
        *
        Add newline characters: Your user's input and your chatbot's response should
        be on separate lines. The character `\n` will add a new line to your message.
        Your newline character needs to live between quotes! \r

        In
        the next lesson, we will start to make your personal assistant smarter.
      U3L23 Chatbot Intro_markdown_instruction: |
        Time to make your own specialized
        digital assistant! We'll be working with this a lot, so make it personalized
        and fun!\r
        \r
        ### Instructions:\r
        \r
        * Choose a topic you want your digital
        assistant to specialize in. It should be something you are interested in and
        know a lot about. Examples: Country Music, Sushi, College Football, Comedy
        Movies\r
        \r
        * Create your digital assistant\r
        \r
        \t* Your digital assistant
        should read the user's input and display it back to them along with some
        default response.\r
            \r
            * Anyone should be able to easily distinguish
        between the text that the user typed and the response from the digital assistant.\r
      U3L23 Digital Assistant 1_markdown_instruction: |-
        To make a digital assistant,
        you'll need to start by reading and displaying the user's input.\r
        \r
        ###
        Instructions:\r
        \r
        * Get the user's input from the <samp>text_input</samp>
        element.\r
        * Set the <samp>text_area</samp> element to display the user's
        input.\r
        \r

        \r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**Hint**</summary>\r
        You
        may need to use the <samp>get_text</samp> and <samp>set_text</samp> blocks\r
        </details>
      U3L23 Digital Assistant 2_markdown_instruction: |
        Next, you need to add a response
        from the digital assistant. For now, just make the digital assistant say "I
        don't know."\r
        \r
        ### Instructions:\r
        \r
        * After each of the user's
        inputs, print the response "I don't know."\r
         * Both the input and the
        response should be visible in the <samp>text_area</samp>\r
        \r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**Example**</summary>\r

        \r
        <details>\r

        Use
        string concatenation! i.e. var string = "Hello" + " World";\r
        </details>\r
      U3L23 Digital Assistant 3_markdown_instruction: |-
        It can get annoying to have
        to delete the input every time you type a prompt for the digital assistant.\r
        \r
        ###
        Instructions:\r
        \r
        * Every time the user's input is displayed in the <samp>text_area</samp>,
        clear the input from the <samp>text_input</samp>\r
        \r
        <details>\r

        setting the text to the empty string: "".\r
        </details>
      U3L23 Digital Assistant 4_markdown_instruction: |
        It makes more sense for the
        user's prompt and the digital assistant's response to be on different lines.
        You can use the newline character, <samp>"\n"</samp>, to split a line.\r
        \r
        ###

        ## String Parsing\r
        \r
        Your
        personal assistant can now respond to many key words. Unfortunately, it doesn't
        understand any keyword if it is in the middle of a sentence. We can solve
        this problem by using the <samp>str.indexOf(searchValue)</samp> function.
        \r
        \r
        <samp>str.indexOf(searchValue)</samp> will return a non-negative number
        if the searchValue is somewhere in str. Otherwise, it will return -1. You
        can use this property to set the condition in an if statement.\r
        \r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**Example**
        </summary>\r
        <pre>`\tif (sentence.indexOf("word") >= 0) {\r
            \tsetText(textArea,
        "'word' is in the sentence!");\r
            }`</pre>\r

        \r
        ###
        Instructions\r
        \r
        * Adjust the chained conditional to use <samp>indexOf()</samp>
        instead of <samp>str == "word"</samp>\r
        * The chef's assistant should
        respond to a sentence that contains the word pizza or the word soup

        Project\r
        \r
        **Your Digital Assistant Project is back!** Now that you've
        learned how to use conditional logic to control your program flow, it's time
        to add functionality to the digital assistant you previously designed.\r
        \r
        #
        Do This:\r
        \r
        * You should have already created a flowchart to design the
        logic for your digital assistant. \r
        * **Use your flowchart to program your
        digital assistant so that it "intelligently" responds to user input.**\r
        \t*
        Feel free to make changes to your existing project in Design Mode, if needed.\r
        *
        **Test your program thoroughly** to make sure your digital assistant responds
        to user input appropriately.\r
        * Once you're done, **submit your project!**\r

        Now
        the Color Bot only responds to the input blue! This isn't really an improvement
        from the bot that always had a default response for anything. Luckily, we
        can add that default response back in by using an `else` statement.\r
        \r
        ###
        Instructions\r
        \r
        * Turn the `if` statement into an `if/else` statement
        to make the bot respond "I don't know that color." if the user types anything
        besides blue.

        ## Chained Conditionals\r
        \r
        Now
        we have a bot that responds to anything and has a special response to the
        color blue. How can we add a special response for more colors? By using an
        `if`/`else if`/`else` statement (read "if" ... "else if" ... "else").
        By adding an `else if` statement, we create a chained conditional. \r
        \r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**Example**</summary>\r
        <pre>`\tif

        else if (yourResponse == mySecondResponse) {\r
            \tsetText("text_area",

        don't agree :(");\r
            }`</pre>\r
        </details> \r
        \r
        ### Instructions\r
        \r
        *
        Adjust the `if`/`else` statement to make an `if`/`else if`/`else` statement.\r
        *
        Chain multiple `else if` statements together to create unique responses for
        at least 5 different colors.\r
        \t* Your color bot must have a unique response
        for the colors blue, red, and green, and for two additional colors of your
        choice.\r
            \r
        <details>\r
        <summary>**Chaining Conditionals**</summary>\r
        We
        can chain as many `else if`'s together as we want. A chained conditional
        could look like `if`/`else if`/`else if`/.../`else if`/`else`. The chain always
        starts with an `if`, ends with and `else`, and has only `else if`'s in between.\r

        If our Movie Bot is asked a question like "What is a good
        comedy movie?" it currently won't know how to respond, **even though the
        question includes one of its keywords.** By using `includes` we can allow
        our Movie Bot to sense if a keyword appears anywhere in the question.\r
        \r
        #
        Do This:\r
        \r
        * **Suggestion: Switch to Text Mode.** This will be much easier
        in Text Mode.\r
        * **Change all your boolean expressions to use `includes`
        instead of `==`**.\r

        The
        way we left the Movie Bot in the last exercise is a little strange to see
        as a user. **Currently when the input doesn't have a question mark the Movie
        Bot says "I only respond to questions." but it still provides a recommendation**.
        We're going to alter our code so that the movie recommendation is only provided
        if the user asks a question.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        * **Nest your movie
        genre `if` statements** inside the "?" `if` statement so that **a recommendation
        is made only if a question was asked**.\r
        * **Remove the "That's a good
        question."** output.\r
        * Ensure that **if your input is not a question**
        then the response is **I only respond to questions.**\r
        * **Test out a couple
        sentences with your keywords** to make sure the change worked.\r
        \r

        We're going to explore
        a new function called `includes`. This function can be used to check if one
        string appears anywhere inside of another. Just like `toUpperCase` and `toLowerCase`
        this function is called using **dot notation**.\r
        \r
        # *includes* Returns
        a Boolean\r
        **`includes` is a function that returns a boolean.** In other
        words, when the function runs it will **evaulate to either `true` or `false`**.
        This function can be used **anywhere you would normally use a boolean expression**.\r
        \r
        You've
        actually **seen a few functions that return a value before this**. `randomNumber`
        is a function that returns a number and `getText` is a function that returns
        a string. In every case we've used these functions **as if they were the
        data type they return (or evaulate to)**. Notice that in block mode these
        functions don't have the connectors that other commands do since they will
        be used as a piece of data within another function.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        *
        **Read the documentation** for `includes`.\r
        * **Starter code** has been
        provided which shows one instance where a string does include a `searchValue`
        and one where it does not.\r
        * **Replicate the style** of these commands
        to check the rest of questions provided.\r
        * **Create three statements of
        your own using `includes`** making use of the `console.log` statements provided.\r
        *
        **Once you're comfortable with this command move on.**

        # *keypress*\r
        \r
        If we
        want to add keyboard input to our apps we'll need to learn about how key
        events work in App Lab. To start let's take a closer look at the `onEvent`
        block. We already know that event handlers call a function. What we'll see
        now is that they also **pass a parameter**. The default name for this parameter
        is simply `event` but you can change it to be anything you like. \r
        \r
        The
        `event` parameter is a more complex kind of variable (called an "Object")
        that we'll learn more about later. For now just know that for both mouse
        and keyboard events, the event parameter passes more information about the
        event. In the case of key events **you can find out the key(s) that were actually
        pressed by using `event.key`**.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        * Drag out an `onEvent`
        block.\r
        * Change the ID to `screen1` and the event type to `keypress`.  \r

        \r
        You
        may have noticed from the last couple of levels that the value of `event.key`
        is just a string which is the name of the key. As a result we can check which
        key was pressed with a simple conditional statement.  For example to check
        for the press of the **"a"** key we could write `if (event.key == "a")`.\r
        \r
        #
        Do This:\r
        The **starter code provided** plays the sound whenever ANY key
        is pressed.\r
        \r
        * Use `console.log` to **find out the value of `event.key`
        when the up arrow is pressed.**\r
        \r
        * **Add an `if` statement** so the
        sound only plays when the when the **up arrow** is pressed.

        statements about genre. However, you might be getting a sinking feeling that
        this could become a lot of nested `if` statements very quickly! \r
        \r
        **Instead
        let's use the AND operator (`&&`) to check for a genre and a rating at the
        same time.** \r
        \r
        <img src="https://images.code.org/a9307ead3b147e0a8016f2054f47f5f2-image-1446153610104.png"
        style="width: 200px; float:right">\r
        \r
        Be careful about the order of
        the `if` statements. As a general principle you want to check the most specific
        conditions before checking more general ones.  For example, you want to have
        an `if` statement that checks for rating AND genre evaluated before one that
        just checks for genre on its own. Having a more general `if` statement checked
        first might cut off or prevent more specific conditions from being reached.\r
        \r
        You
        still want your app to give suggestions when just a rating or just a genre
        is detected, so keep this principle of ordering in mind. (Try them in the
        reverse order if you're interested in seeing what happens :))\r
        \r
        **Note:
        ** Check out the flowchart below to see the logic we are trying to add.\r
        \r
        #
        Do This:\r
        \r
        * **Try the question "What is an R rated comedy movie?**
        to see the result.\r
        \r
        * **Update the code to give only one movie suggestion
        when a genre and a rating are detected in the input.**\r
        \t* Make one set
        of `if`, `else-if`, and `else` statements about genre and rating\r
            *
        Add conditional statements to check for a comedy movie AND a rating. You could
        do this for all the genres but stick to one for now.\r
        \r
        * **Test out a
        couple sentences with your keywords** to make sure the change worked.\r

        from the original project’s database. But what happens if you want to keep
        that data and use it in your remixed app? To do that, you need to **export
        the data** from your original app.\r
        \r
        **Exporting data is the opposite
        process of importing data.** Remember that when you imported data, you provided
        App Lab with a CSV file of the records you wanted to add to your database.

        # Importing Data\r
        \r
        You
        already know how to individually add new records to the tables in your database
        by using the `createRecord` command or by individually adding rows in the
        App Lab data viewer. But **adding new records one by one can quickly become
        tedious** if you want to create several new records.\r
        \r
        Luckily, the data
        viewer allows you to **import data** that you’ve already collected in a **CSV
        file**.\r
        \r
        <details>\r
        <summary>What’s a CSV file? [click to expand]</summary>\r
        \r
        A
        CSV file is a comma-separated values file, which is a plain ASCII text file
        that stores information from a table. Each row in the CSV file corresponds
        to a row in a table of data. The cells in each row are stored as text fields
        separated by commas (hence the name). Because it’s a plain ASCII text document,
        CSV files are a universally-used format for sharing data. Almost all tools
        and programs for working with data - for example, Excel or Google Sheets -
        will allow you to import and export data tables as CSV files.\r
        </details>\r
        <br>\r
        \r
        For
        each row in your CSV file, App Lab will create a new record and populate it
        with the information from that row.\r
        \r
        **Note:** Make sure that **the
        first row in your CSV file lists the names for each column in your table**.
        When you import your file, App Lab will use this row to automatically name
        the columns in your table.\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        We’ve provided you with

        # Using Imported Data\r
        Once
        you’ve imported a CSV file, **you can use the data in your app using the data
        commands you already learned.**\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        * Practice using
        your newly-imported data by **calling `readRecords` on “mytable."**\r

        In the callback function for `readRecords`, **print each record to the console.**
      U4 - Charts - Line Chart 1_markdown_instruction: |
        You’ve seen a few examples
        of scatter charts already, but **there are other chart types that may be better-suited
        to create a visualization** from your data set. In the next few levels, you
        will learn about one of these chart types: the **line chart.**\r
        \r
        # Line
        Charts\r
        \r
        Your database has been populated with records about the **popularity
        of different hashtags** over time. In this level, you will use this data to
        **create a line chart that shows how the popularity of “#tbt” has changed
        over time.**\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        * **Open the data viewer** and look
        at the data you’ve been provided.\r
        * **Add a chart UI element** to your
        app.\r
        * Use the `drawChartFromRecords` block to create a line chart.\r
        \t*
        **Make sure `chartID` matches** the ID of your UI chart.\r
        \t* **Change `chartType`**
        to “line.”\r
        \t* **Change `tableName`** to match the name of the table in
        your database.\r
        \t* **Fill in the `columns` array.** For this chart, you’ll
        want the **months since January 2012 on your x-axis** and the **#tbt popularity
        on your y-axis.**\r
        * **Run the app** and see the results.\r
        \t* Now that
        your chart has meaningful labels, **what conclusions can you draw about the
        data set?** What trends do you notice in the popularity of #tbt over time?
        When was the hashtag most popular? Least popular? How might this information
        be utilized by people who use hashtags to publicize their posts?\r
      U4 - Charts - Line Chart 2_markdown_instruction: |
        In the last level, you may
        have noticed that **the “hashtags” table also has a column of information
        about a second hashtag, “#nofilter”.** Ideally, it would be helpful if your
        chart could show lines for **both** hashtags, so you could **compare the relationship**
        between the two.\r
        \r
        # Plotting Additional Columns\r
        \r
        Fortunately,
        the `columns` parameter allows you to add additional elements to the array.
        You already learned that the first element in `columns` specifies which table
        column to use for the x-axis of your chart. It turns out that ***each additional
        element* will be plotted as a separate line on the y-axis.** This means that,
        if there are three elements total in `columns`, then there will be *two* separate
        lines plotted on your line chart.\r
        \r
        Let’s try an example of this now.
        \r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        * Your code with the line chart from the previous
        level has been provided.\r
        * **Add a third element to the `columns` array**,
        to display another line that shows the change in popularity of #nofilter over
        time. Your code should look something like this (click image to enlarge):\r

        \t* What relationships do you notice
        between the two lines? What conclusions can you draw from this? Which hashtag
        would you want to use if you were trying to publicize your post to the most
        people?\r

      U4 - Charts - Scatter Chart_markdown_instruction: |
        **Congratulations**, you
        made a chart in your app!<br>\r
        \r
        <details><summary><strong>What does it
        all mean?</strong> (Click to expand)</summary><br>\r
        \r
        Although the chart
        you created is pretty, you may have noticed that it’s still difficult to really
        understand what the data set represents, since neither the table nor the columns
        have descriptive and meaningful names.<br>\r
        \r
        In this level, your database
        has been updated so that the **table and column names are more meaningful**.
        Now when you look at the data viewer, you can see that the table actually
        represents **Rotten Tomatoes movie ratings**, and the columns represent the
        **Tomatometer and Audience ratings**. You’re going to have to make some slight
        changes to incorporate these new names, but first you’ll need to learn about
        a few more parameters in the `drawChartFromRecords` block.\r
        </details><br>\r
        \r
        #
        *drawChartFromRecords* Parameters\r
        \r
        You may have noticed in the last
        level that the `drawChartFromRecords` block has a number of different parameters.
        You already used the first two parameters, `chartID` and `chartType`, in the
        last level. In this level, you will learn how to use the next two parameters:
        `tableName` and `columns`.\r
        \r
        ![](https://images.code.org/72fe5a628ad5f4d78489863f6e1db251-image-1450395111592.png)\r
        \r
        \r
        The
        `tableName` parameter lets you specify **which table** from your database
        you want to use to make your chart. This parameter becomes especially important
        if you have more than one table in your database.\r
        \r
        <img src="https://images.code.org/0844592b1473862203c0aeef01d2e83a-image-1450395192097.gif"
        style="width: 200px; float: right">\r
        The `columns` parameter lets you
        specify **which columns** from your table to use when making your chart. `columns`
        is actually an **array of strings**, and **each string specifies the name
        of a column** to be used in your chart. In most cases, the **first element**
        in `columns` will represent which table column you want to use as the **x-axis**
        for your chart. For your scatter chart, the **second element** in `columns`
        will represent which table column you want to plot on the **y-axis**.\r
        \r
        #
        Do This:\r
        \r
        * **Open the data viewer** and look at the data you’ve been
        provided.\r
        * **Add a chart UI element** to your app.\r
        * Use the `drawChartFromRecords`
        block to **create a scatter plot.**\r
        \t* **Make sure `chartID` matches**
        the ID of your UI chart.\r
        \t* **Change `chartType`** to “scatter.”\r
        \t*
        **Change `tableName`** to match the name of the table in your database. Check
        the data viewer if you need to be reminded what your table is named.\r
        \t*
        **Fill in the `columns` array.** For this chart, you’ll want the **Tomatometer
        rating on your x-axis** and the **Audience rating on your y-axis.**\r
        * **Run
        the app** and see the results.\r
        \t* Now that your chart has meaningful labels,
        **what conclusions can you draw about the data set?** What relationships do
        you see between the Tomatometer rating and the Audience rating?\r

        # Visualizing Data\r

        So
        far, you’ve been able to visualize the data you collected by using `readRecords`
        and **printing out your table to the console**. But you may have found that
        **it’s hard to draw meaningful conclusions from your data** by looking at
        a long list of text.\r
        \r
        Another way that people visualize data is by **creating
        graphs or charts**. When you plot information on a chart, you can more easily
        see patterns and trends in your data, which allows you to **understand and
        draw conclusions from your data**. In App Lab, the block that lets you chart

        # Customizing
        Your Charts\r
        \r
        You now have a chart that allows you to **see relationships
        and trends in your data!**\r
        \r
        You may find that you want **greater control
        over the appearance of your chart**. Luckily, `drawChartFromRecords` block
        actually has another parameter that lets you customize different components
        of your chart! Let’s take advantage of that ability now to manipulate some
        components of your chart.\r
        \r
        # The *options* Object\r
        \r
        If you look
        at the `drawChartFromRecords` block, you will see that **there is an additional
        parameter after the `columns` array, called `options`**. This parameter is
        actually an object whose properties correspond to different parts of your
        chart. There are many different properties that you can set for your chart,
        but for this level you’ll only be working with the `title` and `colors` properties.\r
        \r
        #
        Do This:\r
        \r
        * At the beginning of your program, **create a new object
        called `options`.**\r
        * By default, your chart is not labeled with a title,
        but a descriptive title will help others understand your chart more clearly.\r
          *
        **Set the `title` property** to “Popularity of Hashtags Over Time.”\r
        * **Change
        the colors of the lines for each hashtag** by setting the `colors` property.
        `colors` expects an array of strings, where each string is a color name like
        “purple” or “yellow”.\r
        \t* **Note:** When you set `colors`, make sure the
        **number of elements in the array matches the number of columns you’re plotting.**
        For example, if you’re plotting two lines, you’ll need to make sure `colors`
        has two strings - one color for each line.\r
        * **Add your `options` object
        as an additional parameter to `drawChartFromRecords`.** Your code should now
        look something like this (click image to enlarge):<br><a href="https://images.code.org/42fdbac98871d9ebcfca3501a1ae092b-image-1457061566573.6.png"

        when customizing your chart, it’s less about making a pretty chart and more

        A table is very similar

        # Records are Objects\r
        \r
        **What's
        a record?**\r
        In database terminology, each item that is stored in table
        is called a **record**.  This is why the command is called `createRecord`.
        In App Lab, a **record is an object**, and a data table is essentially a collection
        of JavaScript objects stored in the cloud.\r
        \r
        **The second parameter**
        of `createRecord` is the object you are storing in the database.\r
        \r
        *
        As you have seen you can specify the object using notation like this: `{name:"Alice"}`\r
        *
        But you can **also provide an object variable** and the whole object will
        be stored.\r
        * App Lab **creates a column for each property of the object.**\r
        \r
        #
        Do This:\r
        \r
        **Starter code is provided** that creates a simple JavaScript
        object representing a song.\r
        \r
        * Drag out the `createRecord` command.  \r
        *
        **Set the table name** (the first parameter) to something descriptive like
        "mySongs".\r
        * **Set the second parameter** to the name of the object you
        want to store, in this case `song`.\r
        * **Run the program.**\r
        * In the
        Data Viewer **verify that a new table was created and that the `song` object
        was added as a record**.\r

        # Messing Around with Data\r
        \r
        **The
        third parameter** of `createRecord` is a callback function.  **What does it
        do?**\r
        \r
        ![](https://images.code.org/9a89cca8257b7dc807a1637efe121442-image-1449245629915.png)\r
        \r
        *
        Data commands **must be sent across the Internet to a remote server**.\r
        *
        The database follows a **protocol** in which it **responds to every data command
        with a message**. This message might be a piece of data you requested, or
        it could be an error message.\r
        * You might need to use the contents of this
        response in your program, but because of **delays caused by sending information
        back and forth across the Internet** you don't know when you will receive
        it.\r
        * Therefore, you create a **callback function that will be called by
        the system when the response comes back** (in other words when the database
        "calls back"). The parameter of the **callback function** contains the data
        being sent back.\r
        \r
        For `createRecord` the database **responds by sending
        back a copy of the object that was stored**. The `record` parameter of the
        callback function contains that object.\r
        \r
        **Analogy**: When you made
        an event handler using `onEvent`, you also specified a callback function.  That
        function got called **when the user triggered the specific event you were
        watching for**.  The callback function of a database command like `createRecord`
        gets triggered **when the database sends a message back**.  \r

        you just stored is actually in the database (along with a few extra songs

        the copy of the record that was returned by the database.\r

        This app

        The benefit of placing objects in an array is that we can easily
        loop over them and perform the same action with each. This is also why it
        is important that we used the same names for each property. The more standardized
        our data is, the easier it is process with a computer.\r
        \r
        The first way
        we will process our array of students is to display only the names of every
        student. In order to do this we will need to loop over the array using a `for`
        loop, and then access the name property of each student.\r

        # Asynchronous Commands\r

        \r
        We say that the callback function of `readRecords` is **asynchronous**,
        because the rest of your program will not wait for the response from the database;

        Synchronous vs. Asynchronous</strong> [Click to expand]</summary>\r
        <P>\r
        "Asynchronous"
        is the opposite of "synchronous".  In programming, we talk about whether
        <strong>functions are synchronous or asynchronous</strong>.\r
        </P>\r
        <p>\r
        <strong>Synchronous</strong>
        (or "in sync") - things happening at the same time.  "The dance moves were
        in sync with the music." \r
        <ul><li>When functions are "synchronous",
        if Function A calls or triggers Function B, Function B will execute immediately,
        at the moment it's called, and A will wait for B to complete before continuing
        on.\r
        </li>\r
        </ul>\r
        </p>\r
        <p>\r
        <strong>Asynchronous</strong> (or
        "NOT in sync") - things happening at different times or not in a prescribed
        sequence. \r
        <ul>\r
        <li>When functions are asynchronous, if Function A calls
        or triggers Function B, Function B will execute at some <strong>later time
        in the future, and A will continue without waiting for B.</strong> </li>\r
        <li>Asynchronous
        functions are used especially when the Internet is involved, because sending
        a request for data and getting it back can take time. The setup is common:
        send a request for data, and as part of the request specify what <i>should
        happen when the data eventually comes back.  This is what the callback function
        is for.</i></li>\r
        </ul>\r
        </p>\r
        </details>\r
        \r
        <br>\r
        This allows
        your program to keep running while you wait for responses from the database,
        but **asynchronous commands can make it challenging to keep track of the order
        your program will run in**.\r
        \r
        You typically think of programs waiting
        for one command to finish before running the next. This style of programming
        is referred to as **synchronous** and is generally much easier to read and
        write.\r
        \r
        # Callback Functions are like Event Handlers\r
        \r
        **Event
        handlers** for UI elements can be triggered at any time. You cannot know ahead
        of time when the event will be triggered, **so all the code that should run
        when the event is triggered needs to go in the event handler**.\r
        \r
        ![](https://images.code.org/a6303ef07bf90ddf22f77950dd29a971-image-1449691163707.gif)\r
        \r
        The
        same thing is true with the callback function for data commands. **If a piece
        of code should run after a response has been received from the database it
        must be placed in the callback function**.\r
        \r

        \r
        **Tip:
        Treat the callback function of a data command like an event handler. It gets
        triggered when you receive the response from the database**\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r

        **Your
        code from the previous exercise** is provided.\r

        * **Move your second
        `console.log` command inside the callback function**.\r
        * **Run the program**
        and pay close attention to **the order in which the commands run**. You can
        **check the Debug Console** to see which `console.log` command ran first.

        # Reading Records\r
        You have learned

        a remote database. \r

        Check out the new command
        `readRecords`. This command **requests from the database *all* the records
        stored in one table.**. \r
        \r
        The database responds by the sending an **array
        of objects** back to your program - one object for every record in the table.  As
        with `createRecord`, the data sent back by the database will come through
        **callback function in the `records` parameter**.\r

        You
        may have run into this in the previous level already, but let's see what
        happens when we try to `readRecords` from a table that doesn't exist in our

        \r
        If
        you read from a table that doesn't exist you won't get any error messages
        and the database will respond by <strong>sending back an empty array of records</strong>.  An
        empty array looks like [] in the console.  Any other tables in the database
        are left unchanged.\r
        </p>\r
        <p>\r
        As a <strong>debugging tip:</strong>
        if your requests for reading records from the database are coming up empty,
        double check that the code and the actual table name are spelled the table
        name <i>exactly the same</i> - capitalization and spaces matter!\r

        You are keeping the index of the current
        object as a global variable called `currentIndex`.\r
        \r
        Thus, the **current
        object on the "showContactsScreen"** is found at `records[currentIndex]`.\r
        \r
        To
        make the delete button work, we can simply send the object we want to delete
        to `deleteRecord`. \r
         * Notice that because `records[currentIndex]` **contains
        the "id" of the object you hope to delete, you don't need to make any changes
        to the object before sending it**.\r

        # Deleting Records with Code\r
        \r
        You
        can delete a record "by hand" in the Data Viewer by clicking the <img src="https://images.code.org/b45cebe6d06d8c2d45a233bd3c472a62-image-1449850229074.png"
        style="width: 50px"> button.\r
        \r
        To delete a record with code you use
        the `deleteRecord` command.  It works similarly to the other data tools in
        that it has 3 parameters:\r
        \r
         * The **name of the table** you want to
        delete from.\r
         * The **object** you want to delete.\r
         * A **callback**
        function.\r
        \r
        `deleteRecord` is **different from the other data commands**
        in one critical way. The object you send to the database ***only* needs to
        contain the id of the record** you want to delete.  \r
         \r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        **Your
        database already includes a table called "mytable"**\r
        \r
         * Go to the
        Data Viewer and **look at the data in "mytable"**.\r
         * **Drag out** the
        `deleteRecord` block.\r
         \t* It includes **default code** to delete the record
        with id:1 in "mytable".\r
         * Run the code and **confirm that the record
        with id:1 ("Greg") is deleted from the database**.\r

        # Deleting Records Continued...\r
        \r
        The
        other difference with `deleteRecord` is that the database **sends back a boolean
        called `success`.** \r
        \r
        Using the `success` boolean, you can write a callback
        function that will behave differently based on whether or not `deleteRecord`
        ran successfully.\r
        \r
        * If the database was able to successfully delete
        the specified record, `success` will be set to **true** in the callback function.
        \r
        * If the database was **not** able to delete the record, `success` will
        be **false.**\r
        \r
        Let's do a little more experimentation with `deleteRecord`
        on a sample database.  **We've given you a new database that has about 40
        songs in it.** You have a few different things to try so don't miss them.\r
        \r
        #
        Do This:\r
        \r
        * **Click View Data.** Look at the "mySongs" table and **find
        the ID of the song "Little Bunny Foo Foo."** \r
        * **Drag out the `deleteRecord`
        block.**\r
          * Set the table name to "mySongs."\r
          * Set the `id` of
        the object to delete to the ID of "Little Bunny Foo Foo."\r
        * **Add an
        `if` statement to the callback function.**\r
          * If `success` is true, print
        "Record deleted successfully" to the console.\r
          * Otherwise, print "Could
        not delete record" to the console.\r
        * **Run the code.**\r
          * Verify that
        you deleted "Little Bunny Foo Foo" from the list of songs.\r
        * **Run the
        exact same code again.**\r
          * This will attempt to delete a record with
        the ID you just deleted. See what happens...

        a unique id.  That id will never be used again, even if you delete it. ![](https://images.code.org/352bbbd91c14aa8a4a37fcc309f29d93-image-1449782149871.gif)\r

        Now
        that you have a better sense of this lessons in this sequence, let’s think
        about the types of supports students will need in order to be successful.
        Since the curriculum is based on inquiry learning, lessons feature activities
        that engage students in discovering core concepts themselves. It’s important
        to think through implementation plans and student support. In this task you
        will make a plan for teaching and student support **for one of the lessons
        in this sequence** that takes into account differentiation strategies and
        make-up work for absent students. Your teaching and student support plan should
        cover the following: \r
        \r
        \r
        - **Which lesson in the sequence are you
        discussing?** \r
        \r
        - **Details on how you will implement and differentiate
        the lesson:**\r
        \r
         - An outline of any changes you will need to make to
        the lesson to fit your local constraints or context (for example: pacing and
        time, dealing with classroom setup, etc). \r
         - An overview of the types
        of student needs you’ll likely need to support in your classroom (for example:
        students who are struggling to understand the underlying concept; students
        who are already familiar with the concept, but still have room to learn more;
        etc)\r
         - Your plan for addressing each of the needs outlined above (for
        example: integrating extension activities or other materials for students
        who already know something about the topic)\r
         - How will you address or
        emphasize the connection between lessons in this sequence? \r
        \r
        - **Plan
        for catching up absent students:**\r
        \r
         - How will absent students catch
        up on activities they missed? \r
         - How will you use the fact that the lessons
        in this sequence are related and build on one another to address make-up work?
        \r
        \r
        You can type out your teaching and student support plan in the box
        below, or you can upload a word doc or pdf file. \r

        #### Task Review Details\r
        \r
        If this module
        is listed as  your “focus area”, then your response to the prompt above will
        be shared anonymously and reviewed by your peers, and you will review the
        work done by other teachers. Reviewers will be looking for thoughtful and
        thorough answers that demonstrate that you have spent time considering how
        the lesson will play out in your own classroom. Reviewers will have an opportunity
        to give feedback on your submission, and you can respond to that feedback
        and resubmit. \r
        \r
        In order to get credit for completing this task, two
        reviewers need to agree that you have responded to the prompts fully. If reviewers
        don’t feel comfortable making a decision about your task submission, they
        can elevate to a facilitator to review. You will always have a chance to address
        feedback from your reviewers and resubmit your task! Reviewer feedback will
        show up at the bottom of this page, once it’s available. \r

        Lessons 8 - 9: Teaching and Student Support Plan\r
        \r
        ## Task Description\r
        \r
        Now
        that you have a better sense of this lessons in this sequence, let’s think
        about the types of supports students will need in order to be successful.
        Since the curriculum is based on inquiry learning, lessons feature activities
        that engage students in discovering core concepts themselves. It’s important
        to think through implementation plans and student support. In this task you
        will make a plan for teaching and student support **for one of the lessons
        in this sequence** that takes into account differentiation strategies and
        make-up work for absent students. Your teaching and student support plan should
        cover the following: \r
        \r
        \r
        - **Which lesson in the sequence are you
        discussing?** \r
        \r
        - **Details on how you will implement and differentiate
        the lesson:**\r
        \r
         - An outline of any changes you will need to make to
        the lesson to fit your local constraints or context (for example: pacing and
        time, dealing with classroom setup, etc). \r
         - An overview of the types
        of student needs you’ll likely need to support in your classroom (for example:
        students who are struggling to understand the underlying concept; students
        who are already familiar with the concept, but still have room to learn more;
        etc)\r
         - Your plan for addressing each of the needs outlined above (for
        example: integrating extension activities or other materials for students
        who already know something about the topic)\r
         - How will you address or
        emphasize the connection between lessons in this sequence? \r
        \r
        - **Plan
        for catching up absent students:**\r
        \r
         - How will absent students catch
        up on activities they missed? \r
         - How will you use the fact that the lessons
        in this sequence are related and build on one another to address make-up work?

        **Response
        A:** *Facial recognition technology stores data mapping a user's face, for
        example to unlock a phone. A privacy concern for this technology is that governments
        could force technology companies to turn over this data allowing them to passively

        to justify getting rid of less productive players.*\r
        \r
        **Response C:**
        *Social networks allow users to share vast amounts of private information
        about their lives. A security concern of this technology is that this publicly
        available data may enable stalkers or other criminals to identify potential
        targets.*\r

        **Response D:** *Self-driving vehicles store vast amounts
        of information about their location and the world around them. A data concern

        # Creating Your Own Objects\r
        \r
        **Objects
        are unordered collections of name value pairs**. Like an array they can hold
        many pieces of information, but where arrays use a numeric index to reference
        specific pieces of information, objects use a descriptive name. We lose the
        "ordered" nature of our data, but we gain the ability to describe the purpose
        of each piece of data within a collection.\r
        \r
        Consider the event objects
        you just looked at. An array can just as easily store all the information
        they contain, but it would be difficult to determine what any of the values
        represent.\r
        \r
        **The syntax for creating objects of your own is shown below**\r
        \r
        *
        Curly braces are placed around the contents of an object `{}`\r
        * Names are
        separated from values with a colon `:`\r
        * Name value pairs are separated
        by commas `,`\r
        * Names must be strings. If they are not they will be coerced
        to strings, possibly creating unpredictable behavior.\r
        * **Example:** `var
        user = {"userName":"Ada", "password":"csIsAwesome", "yearBorn":1815};`\r
        \r
        #
        Do This\r
        \r
        **Starter code** is provided which creates an empty object
        and displays its value.\r
        \r
        * Modify the code **using the syntax above**
        to create an object of your own. Your object should contain **at least 5 pieces
        of information including both strings and numbers**.\r
        * **Run the program**
        and confirm all values in your object appear as you expected.
      U4L02 - Objects - eventParameter_markdown_instruction: |-
        # We've Seen Objects
        Before\r
        \r
        We're going to see how we can use objects to organize data
        in our own apps, but this actually isn't the first time we've used objects
        in our programs. **The object that we've used most frequently is the event
        parameter of our event handlers**. This single object contains many pieces
        of information about the event which can be accessed to determine how to respond
        to the event. For example `event.key` contains the key that was pressed for
        key events, and `event.offsetX` and `event.offsetY` contain the location of
        the mouse for mouse events.\r
        \r
        Before we move on to creating objects of
        our own, let's take another look at this event parameter (or as we'll call
        it now event object) and recall how they were used.\r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        \r
        **Starter
        code** is provided which creates event handlers for both a "click" and "keydown"
        event and displays the contents of the event object they create.\r
        \r
        *
        **Run the program** and trigger both a keyboard event and a mouse event.\r
        *
        **Examine the objects displayed in the Debug Console** to recall the different
        pieces of information they contain.\r
        * **Reflect: ** Why wouldn't we want
        this information stored in many variables? Why wouldn't we want this information
        stored in an array?

        ## Step
        1 - Make randButtonId a global variable\r
        \r
        Making `randButtonId` global
        means modifying the code to declare/create it *outside* of any function and
        then setting its value *inside* setBoard().\r
        \r
        * Create a new variable
        on line 1: `var randButtonId`;\r
        * **Switch to text-mode** \r
        * Inside the
        setBoard() function, delete the `var` in front of `randButtonId` so that rather
        than re-creating the variable, we set the value of the global one.\r
        \r
        Updated
        code should look like this (new or updated lines have `<--` arrows)\r
        \r
        \tvar
        randButtonId;     <-- declare as global variable\r
            setBoard();\r
            function
        setBoard(){\r
            \t\r
                //...set board code...\r
                \r
                randButtonId
        = "button"+randomNumber(1,4);    <-- remove "var" from assignment\r
                \r
            }\r
        \r
        **Testing
        it out**\r
        \r
        Unfortunately, there is not much to test here other than to
        determine your code still functions.  This is just a step that doesn't really
        change any functionality.\r
        \r
        * If it works the same as before, it's probably
        right, move on.\r
        * If it's broken or doesn't run double-check the changes
        you made.\r

        ##
        Steps 2 and 3 - Add checkCorrect(buttonId) and Event Handlers\r
        \r
        This
        feels like a big step, but it's actually just a few small ones.  We'll see
        some new functionality at the end.\r
        \r
        1. **Add a function definition for
        `checkCorrect(buttonId)` that:**\r
        \t* Contains a console.log message to
        display the parameter\r
            * Calls setBoard()\r
        \r
                    function
        checkCorrect(buttonId){\r
                        console.log("Checking: "+buttonId);\r
                        setBoard();\r
                    }\r
        \r
        2.
        **Add 4 "click" event handlers - one for each button - that call checkCorrect**\r
        \t*
        The event handling functions should call `checkCorrect(...)` with its button
        id.\r
        \t* So for *button1* it should look something like:\r
        \r
        \t\t\tonEvent("button1",
        "click", function(){\r
                \t\tcheckCorrect("button1");\r
                \t});\r
                \r
        \r
        **TESTING**\r
        \r
        Once
        you've added this code you should really see some changes.  When you click
        on buttons you should see:\r
        1. Console messages showing what was clicked\r
        2.
        The board should change each time you click a button\r
        3. Console messages
        showing the correct answer for each new board.\r

        ##
        Step 4 - add an if-statement in *checkCorrect*\r
        \r
        **Add a simple `if-else`
        statement inside the function `checkCorrect` that:**\r
        \r
        * Compares `buttonId`
        and `randButtonId` and\r
        * Displays a message to console that they got right
        or wrong\r
        \r
        Insert something like this *between* your existing console.log
        statement and the call to setBoard()\r
        \r
        \t\tif( buttonId == randButtonId
        ) {\r
                \tconsole.log("You got it right!");\r

                \tconsole.log("WRONG");\r
                }\r
        \r
        **TEST
        IT: Verify that the if-statement is giving correct results**\r
        <img src="https://images.code.org/8fd0d14a4c32a6e36299251a2edb56bb-image-1481148748359.png"

        \r
        * You should be able to click on buttons and
        see messages that verify your if-statement is working\r
        * Be sure to click
        on all the buttons to test the scenarios\r
        \t* Is it detecting correct or
        incorrect button clicks properly?\r
            * Is it changing the board every
        time?\r
        * Your console output might look something like what's shown at
        right.\r
        \r
        **TIP:** It might be useful to temporarily remove or comment
        out the call to `setBoard()` so the board doesn't change every time when
        you click.  This would let you verify that every button works right for a
        single board setup.  Then add it back in once you're done.

        This is another step that requires 3
        parts.  But **notice there is a pattern** to what we're starting to do, and
        it is a common one:\r
        \r
        1. Add a global variable\r
        2. Add a new function
        definition (that updates that variable in some way)\r
        3. Add a call to the
        new function you just made.\r
        \r
        And that's exactly what you're going
        to do right now.\r
        \r
        1. Add global `var currentPlayer = 1` to the top of
        the program.\r
        2. Add a new function definition in your code for `switchPlayer()`
        with an if-statement and console.log message.  It should look something like
        this:\r
        \r
        \t\tfunction switchPlayer(){\r
                \tif(currentPlayer==1){\r
                    \tcurrentPlayer=2;\r
                    }
        else {\r
                    \tcurrentPlayer=1;\r
                    }\r
                    console.log("current
        player is: "+currentPlayer);\r
                }\r
        \r
        3. Add a call `switchPlayer()`
        as the last line inside the `checkCorrect` function\r

        \r
        A choice has been made for you in the design
        of the app to indicate whose turn it is in the UI.\r
        \r
        * Notice in the
        design that there are two gray rectangles behind the player scores with ids
        `player1_highlight` and `player2_highlight`.  `player2_highlight` starts out
        hidden.\r
        \r
        Do this:\r
        * Add code to the `if` statement in `switchPlayer`\r
        *
        Use the `hideElement` and `showElement` commands (found in the UI controls
        toolbox) to show and hide these rectangles as a way of indicating whose turn
        it is.\r
        * For example if it's player 1's turn, then show `player1_highlight`
        and hide `player2_highlight`\r
        \r
        When you're done you should see the player
        highlight alternate like the graphic above.\r
        \r
        **TIP**: Make the `player2_highlight`
        start out hidden by checking the "hidden" box for it in design mode.\r

        a few lines after you just set the color in the first place but it will happen

        Suggestion:\r
        Add
        `console.log(randButtonId)` somewhere after you generate the button ID so
        you can see which button is supposed to have the different color.  It might
        be hard to spot!

        **Second:** Add 20 to each
        of the R, G, B values to make `diffColor`\r
        \r
        **This means** you will have

        You should
        now have code that sets the color of the buttons and picks one at random to
        make a slightly different color.  \r
        \r
        This is good functionality that,
        now that it's working means we can move onto the next problem. But for the
        game we're going to want to do this multiple times so that's a clue we should
        make a function\r
        \r
        DO THIS:\r
        \r
        * Define a new function called `setBoard`.\r
        *
        Move all of the code that sets the colors of the buttons inside the function
        [licecap]\r
        * add a call to `setBoard` to verify that it works
      U5 ColorSleuth part 5 make random RGB string_markdown_instruction: |-
        We can
        use the *same technique* to generate a random color.\r
        \r
        all colors are
        defined as strings with only difference being the numbers that are used.\r
        \r

        ## Next
        Step - encapsulate "game board" creation in a function\r
        \r
        Let's call
        the 4 buttons with random colors the **"Game Board."** Assuming that your
        program now creates a new randomly generated game board each time you run,
        let's take the next step.\r
        \r
        When playing the game we need to create
        a new game board repeatedly, not just when the program starts.  Since we have
        a chunk of code that we want to use repeatedly, **that's a clue we should
        take that code and put it in a function**.\r
        \r
        ## DO THIS:\r
        \r
        * Define
        a new function called `setBoard`.\r
        * Move all of the code that sets the
        colors of the buttons inside the function - this is actually **all** the code
        you have so far.\r
        * Add a call to `setBoard()` as the first line of code
        in the program to verify that it works\r
        * When you're done the code should
        look like this:\r
        \r
            \tsetBoard();  \t\t\t\r
            \tfunction setBoard(){\r
        \r
        \t\t\t<
        all the button color setting code \r
                    you wrote from previous
        exercises >\r
                    \r
        \t\t}\r
            \r
            \r
        <details><summary><strong>TIP:</strong>
        This is easy in text-mode [click to expand]</summary>\r
        \r
        <p>\r
        Because
        this is a relatively large chunk of code to move inside a function, it might
        be easier to do in text mode.\r
        </p>\r
        <li>Add the function definition at
        the top including the opening curly-brace</li>\r
        <li>Type a closing curly-brace
        at the bottom</li>\r
        <li>Optional: indent all the code inside the function
        so it looks cleaner - select all and hit TAB</li>\r
        \r

        \r
        </details>\r
        <br>\r
        **NOTE:**
        The program should not behave any differently after this step - we're just
        organizing the code to make it more useful. In the next step will make more
        use of `setBoard()`.  For now, just make the function and call it once.\r

      U5 ColorSleuth scoring pt1 vars function stub console_markdown_instruction: |-
        ##
        Next Step - add function updateScoreBy \r
        \r
        We're going to follow the
        same pattern we used when adding switch player.  We'll add variables, a function,
        calls to the function, and for now just use `console.log` statements to verify
        we've got things working.\r
        \r
        1. Add global variables to the top of the
        code: `var p1Score=0;` and `var p2Score=0;`\r
        2. Add a new function definition
        `updateScoreBy` with an if-statement and console.log to verify.  Something
        like this:\r
        \r
        \t\tfunction updateScoreBy(amt){\r
                \tif(currentPlayer
        == 1){\r
                    \tp1Score = p1Score + amt;\r
                    } else {\r
                    \tp2Score
        = p2Score + amt;\r
                    }\r
                    console.log("P1 score: "
        + p1Score);\r
                    console.log("P2 score: " + p2Score);\r
                }\r
        \r
        3.
        Add calls to `updateScoreBy(1)` and `updateScoreBy(-3)` to the appropriate
        place inside the if statement in the `checkCorrect` function.\r
        \t* You can
        leave your console.log statements in there for now as well.  Just add calls
        to `updateScoreBy` along with them.\r
        \r
        **TEST IT OUT**\r
        \r
        When you
        run the program now you should be able to verify in the console that the player's
        scores are updating.  Study the console output to make sure and verify that:\r
        \r
        *
        updateScoreBy is being called from checkCorrect with each click\r
        \t* if
        you have console.log statements in `updateScoreBy` then you should at least
        see that it's being called with each click\r
        * The correct player's score
        is being updated\r
        * The scores are being updated by the correct amount\r
        \r
        A
        sample of the output might look like this:\r
        \r
        ![](https://images.code.org/eb33f7d6d634e4f98e613bc13b231601-image-1481219318239.png)

        * if currentPlayer ==
        player1\r
              player1Score += amt\r
        * else\r
               player2score += amt\r
               \r
        Note:
        cleverness of `amt` var.  Means we don't need to decide whether to add or
        subtract.  \r

        style="float: right">\r
        This is pretty easy at this point.\r
        \r
        There
        are UI text labels for the player's scores called `score1_label` and `score2_label`.\r
        \r
        Add
        `setText` statements at the end of the function (either replace the console.log
        statements, or just add after them).  The label for player 1 would look like
        this:\r
        \r
        \t\tsetText("score1_label", p1Score);\r
        \r
        **TEST IT OUT**\r
        \r
        *
        After adding the `setText` statements you should see the score being updated
        with each click (see animation).\r
        * You can actually play the game a little
        bit now!\r
        \r
        <details><summary>Why set both text labels each time? [click
        to expand]</summary>\r
        \r
        You might be wondering why we set <em>both</em>
        text labels each time <code>updateScoreBy</code> is called, rather than putting
        it inside the if-statement to set the text of the appropriate label.  After
        all, only one score is changing every time.<br>\r
        <li>The reason is basically:
        laziness.  Even though only one score will change with each click, it really
        doesn't hurt to set both text labels just to be safe.</li>\r
        <li>In the
        future, maybe you might change the app so that both player1 and player2's
        scores might change with a single click. Maybe, maybe not.</li>\r
        <li>But
        we can be lazy and just set both score text labels every time and not have
        to worry about it.</li>\r

        in this sequence** that takes into account differentiation strategies and
        make-up work for absent students. Your teaching and student support plan should
        cover the following: \r
        \r
        \r
        - **Which lesson in the sequence are you
        discussing?** \r
        \r
        - **Details on how you will implement and differentiate
        the lesson:**\r
        \r
         - An outline of any changes you will need to make to
        the lesson to fit your local constraints or context (for example: pacing and
        time, dealing with classroom setup, etc). \r
         - An overview of the types
        of student needs you’ll likely need to support in your classroom (for example:
        students who are struggling to understand the underlying concept; students
        who are already familiar with the concept, but still have room to learn more;
        etc)\r
         - Your plan for addressing each of the needs outlined above (for
        example: integrating extension activities or other materials for students
        who already know something about the topic)\r
         - How will you address or
        emphasize the connection between lessons in this sequence? \r
        \r
        - **Plan
        for catching up absent students:**\r
        \r
         - How will absent students catch
        up on activities they missed? \r
         - How will you use the fact that the lessons

        ## Task Description\r
        \r
        Now
        that you have a better sense of this lessons in this sequence, let’s think
        about the types of supports students will need in order to be successful.
        Since the curriculum is based on inquiry learning, lessons feature activities
        that engage students in discovering core concepts themselves. It’s important
        to think through implementation plans and student support. In this task you
        will make a plan for teaching and student support **for one of the lessons
        in this sequence** that takes into account differentiation strategies and
        make-up work for absent students. Your teaching and student support plan should
        cover the following: \r
        \r
        \r
        - **Which lesson in the sequence are you
        discussing?** \r
        \r
        - **Details on how you will implement and differentiate
        the lesson:**\r
        \r

        ### Points to pay attention
        to:\r
        \r
        * The "Boolean operators" are AND and OR.  \r
        * In JavaScript
        you write them as `&&` for AND and `||` for OR.\r
        * You use them to combine
        boolean expressions into a single statement when you need to check multiple
        conditions before executing a particular segment of code.\r

        *
        **START at 2:20**  \r
            This is the second half of the video you watched
        earlier. \r
        \r
        * An If-else-if statement let's you check more than one
        condition at a time.\r
        * The **order of conditions matters**. Since conditions
        are checked sequentially from top to bottom, the code that gets executed will
        be the *first* statement to evaluate to true.\r

        \r
        ## You try it \r
        \r
        This is a slightly more
        involved example.  You'll need to study the starting design and code a little
        bit, but you only have to insert a single if-else statement and move some
        lines of code into the appropriate if or else clause to make it work.\r
        \r

        Do this\r
        \r
        **Study the starting code first to see what it does**\r
        \r
        *
        You *can* run it to see what happens before doing anything - it just won't
        work right\r
        * **Notice** the function `reset()` - which hides the images.  \r
        \t*
        We made a function because we want to run this code from two different event
        handlers.\r
        \r
        **Add an if-else statement in the *roll_btn* event handler**
        to check if the random number that represents a dice roll matches the user's
        guess in the dropdown\r
        \r
        If they guessed correctly\r
        * Show the trophy
        image\r
        * Add 6 to the score\r
        \r
        Otherwise:\r
        * Show the frowny face
        image\r
        * Subtract 1 from the score\r
        \r
        **Setup Notes:**\r
        * All UI elements
        are added for you (images are hidden) - flip to Design Mode to see.\r
        * All
        lines of code *except* for the if-else statement and condition are also provided
        - you'll need to move them around once you've added the if-else statement.\r
        *
        Notice the global `score` variable which will keep track of the score between
        clicks\r
        * We've added comments in the code to help you out - you can remove
        them if you like.\r

        could use <code>getText("guess_dropdown")</code> and it would still work,
        because <code>==</code> tries to convert text to a number for comparison so
        <code>"6"==6</code> is true.  But since we're expecting a number in the
        dropdown we should use <code>getNumber</code> so it makes sense when reading
        the code.)\r

        \r
        ## You Try It\r
        \r
        This example is very similar
        to the worked example on the previous page - it is a version of the movie
        age checker that uses a dropdown.\r
        \r
        We've provided the starting UI elements,
        including the dropdown - but none of the code.\r
        \r
        **Do this:**\r
        Using
        the examples on the previous page as a guide...\r
        \r
        * Add an event handler
        for the *dropdown menu that triggers on *"change"*.\r
        * Add an if statement
        to check if the age chosen in the dropdown is `>=` to 13 and set the text
        in the *result_label*\r
        \t* if the age is 13 or over set the text to "You
        are old enough to see a PG-13 movie alone"\r
            * Otherwise, set the text
        to "You are not old enough to see a PG-13 movie alone"\r
        \r
        **Tip:** Use
        `getNumber(id)` instead of `getText(id)` to get the value out of the dropdown\r
        \r
        *
        One major difference from the example is that we want to compare the value
        of the dropdown to a number using `>=` rather than with `==`\r
        * You should
        to use `getNumber("age_dropdown")` to extract the value *as a number rather
        than text*. \r
        * This is the same reason we use `promptNum` instead of `prompt`
        for simple console examples.\r
        * It will still work if you use `getText`
        but isn't good form.

        **Make
        an app tells you whether to stay home or go to school based on what day of
        the week it is.**\r
        \r
        \r
        In this challenge you will:\r
        \r
        * Add your
        own dropdown menu in design mode\r
        * Add an event handler for the dropdown\r
        *
        Write an if-statement that's slightly tricky\r
        \r
        ## Do this:\r
        \r
        *
        In Design Mode **add a dropdown** menu and fill it with the days of the week:
        *Monday, Tuesday,...,Sunday*\r
        * **Add an event handler** for that dropdown
        that activates on *"change"*\r
        * **Add an `if-else` statement** to the
        event handler that checks which day was selected and...\r
        \r
        \t* **If**
        the day selected was a weekend day (*Saturday* or *Sunday*) then display a
        message that says "It's the weekend! Stay home!"\r
        \r
        \t* **Otherwise**
        (the day is a weekday) display a message that says "It's a weekday. Go to
        school".\r
        * Your message should be displayed by setting the text of the
        *msg_label* provided in design mode.\r
        \r
        ## Testing:\r
        \r
        * Once you
        have something functional, make sure you test *every* day of the week to verify
        the output is correct\r
        * The if-statement here is trickier than before.\r

        recreate the movie ratings example from the previous page (and video).\r
        \r
        Add
        an `if-else-if` statement with a series of `else-if`s to display the right
        message based on the user's age.\r
        \r
        We've started you out with code
        that prompts the user for her age.  We've also provided all the console.log
        statements you need.\r
        \r
        **Your task:** Add an `if-else-if` statement with
        the appropriate *Boolean expressions*, and move the `console.log` statements
        into the right clause so the correct message gets displayed.  Here is a reminder
        of what is supposed to happen.\r
        \r
        * **If** the user's age is 17 or over,
        they can see an R-rated movie\r
        * **else if** the user's age is 13 or over,
        they can see a PG-13 movie\r
        * **else if** the user's age is 5 or over they
        can see a PG movie\r
        * **else** display a message about the user being too
        young\r
        \r

        <img src="https://images.code.org/f762344bc839dd8385730bb7d909657f-image-1446237096776.31.12
        PM.png" style="width: 40px"> will add an `else`, the second will add an
        `else-if`.\r
        \r
        **Remove an `else-if`** -- if you add an extra `else-if`
        by accident, you can remove it by switching into text mode and deleting the
        text.  Don't forget to delete the curly-braces `{` and `}` that go with it.\r

        #*updateRecord*
        Callback Function\r
        \r
        You may have noticed that the callback function for
        `updateRecord` has an additional parameter: `success`. When `updateRecord`
        finishes, it returns the updated record as well as a boolean called `success`,
        which is `true` if the record was successfully updated and `false` otherwise.\r
        \r
        The
        `success` parameter is useful in altering how your program behaves based on
        whether an error occurred when your program tried to update a record.\r
        \r
        **Your
        code from the previous exercise has been provided.**\r
        \r
        # Do This: \r
        \r
        *
        Add a line to the beginning of `updateSong` that sets `songToUpdate.seconds`.\r
        \t*
        **Hint:** "Eye of the Tiger" is 244 seconds long.\r
        * Add an `if-else`
        block inside the callback function for `updateRecord`.\r
        \t* If `updateRecord`
        finishes successfully, print out the updated record’s title and artist.\r
        \t*
        Otherwise, if `updateRecord` does not finish successfully, print out an error
        message.\r
        * Run the program and verify that the updated song title and artist
        are still printed to the console.\r

        Now that you’re familiar with how `updateRecord`

        contacts in your database. First, you’ll need to do some work in Design Mode

        * **Change the “Delete”
        button on the “viewContactsScreen” to an “Edit” button.** Make sure you **change
        the button text and ID to something descriptive**. You might also want to
        change the style of the button.\r
        \t* **Note:** Leave the event handler for
        the old “Delete” button as is. You’ll still use it  later.\r
        * **Add a new
        screen called “editContactsScreen”** and add UI elements that look similar
        to the ones in the image. Don’t forget to give your UI elements **descriptive
        and meaningful names**.\r
        \t* **Note:** Make sure the ID for your new “Delete”
        button matches the ID in your event handler for the old delete button. If
        you do this, your new “Delete” button should work without needing to change
        anything in your event handler.\r

        \t*
        Set the screen to `viewContactsScreen`.\r
        * **Add an event handler for the
        “Edit” button.** In the event handler:\r
        \t* Use `setText` to populate each
        of the text inputs with the appropriate information from the current contact
        (which you can access using `contacts[currentIndex]`).\r
        \t* Set the screen
        to `editContactsScreen`.\r
        * **Add an event handler to update the preview
        image** on the “Edit” screen when the user changes the image URL.\r
        \t* This
        event handler should be analogous to the one you wrote for `editURLinput`.\r
        *
        If you haven’t already, **move the `setScreen` line from your “Save Contact”
        button event handler into `showCurrentContact`.** This way, when you delete
        a contact and reload your local copy of `contacts`, your app will redirect
        to the “View Contacts” screen.\r
        * **Run your program** and verify that the
        “Edit,” “Go Back,” and “Delete” buttons all work and that your preview image
        updates when you change the URL text.\r

        \r
        Sometimes

        in your database. You can do this using the `updateRecord` block.\r
        \r

        `updateRecord`
        has three parameters:\r

        * The **name of the table** which contains the
        record you want to update\r
        * The **object** you want to update.\r
        * A **callback
        function**\r
        \r
        The object in the second parameter needs to have an ID property.
        As with `deleteRecord`, this object’s ID is used to determine which record
        in the database should be updated.\r

        \r
        # Do This:\r

        updating the record in the database. But when should `updateRecord` fail?\r
        \r
        Remember,
        the object parameter needs to have an ID property that matches the ID of a
        record in the specified table. If the object doesn’t have an ID property or
        if the ID property doesn’t exist in the table, `updateRecord` won’t be able
        to successfully update the record.\r
        \r
        To see this behavior, you’re going
        to add some code that will force `updateRecord` to fail.\r
        \r
        **Your code
        from the previous exercise has been provided.**\r
        \r
        # Do This:\r
        \r
        *
        At the beginning of the `updateSong` function, set `songToUpdate.artist` to
        a different string.\r
        * Add another line to set `songToUpdate.id` to an ID
        that isn’t in the **mySongs** table (e.g., **8**).\r
        * Run the program. Take
        note of what gets printed to the console, then check the "Eye of the Tiger"
        record in the Data Viewer.\r
        \r

        <details>\r
        <summary><strong>What
        happened?</strong> (click to expand)</summary>\r
        \r
        When the record ID doesn’t
        match any in the specified table, `updateRecord` can’t find a record to update,
        so it sets the `success` parameter in the callback function to `false` and
        finishes without changing any records. Be careful to always make sure the
        object you pass `updateRecord` has an ID that matches a record in the table.\r

        All colors, whether
        they have names or not, can be described by the level of red, green, and blue
        light it takes to make them.  This is called an RGB value (short for Red-Green-Blue).  You

        colors they make.\r

        and use the sliders to adjust the levels of red, green, and blue light.\r

        cyan.  When you mix the three primary colors together (red, green, and blue),

        # Unit 5 Teaching Practice Plan: Group Work and Peer
        Learning\r
        \r
        For this task, you’re going to develop and submit a Teaching
        Practice Plan, which details your plan for supporting group work throughout
        unit 5. Your plan should address the following things: \r
        \r
        - What is your
        plan for supporting students who are struggling to engage in group work, either
        because they prefer to work alone, or because they are having issues collaborating
        with their partner(s)?\r
        - How do you plan to help make sure all members
        of the team have a voice in their groups’ discussions?\r
        - How can you help
        students understand and appreciate the importance of learning through and
        from one another? \r
        - What recommendations will you give students about
        collaboration on their Create Performance Task? \r
        \r
        You can type out your
        teaching practice plan in the box below, or you can upload a word doc or pdf
        file. \r
        \r
        ## Getting Credit for Completing this Task\r
        \r
        #### Task
        Review Details\r
        \r
        If this module is listed as  your “focus area”, then
        your response to the prompt above will be shared anonymously and reviewed
        by your peers, and you will review the work done by other teachers. Reviewers
        will be looking for thoughtful and thorough answers that demonstrate that
        you have spent time considering how this practice will fit into your own classroom.
        Reviewers will have an opportunity to give feedback on your submission, and
        you can respond to that feedback and resubmit. \r
        \r
        In order to get credit
        for completing this task, two reviewers need to agree that you have responded
        to the prompts fully. If reviewers don’t feel comfortable making a decision
        about your task submission, they can elevate to a facilitator to review. You
        will always have a chance to address feedback from your reviewers and resubmit
        your task! Reviewer feedback will show up at the bottom of this page, once
        it’s available. \r

        The

        notice that different web browsers, or even different versions of the same
        browser, display a website differently. Often this is because you either missed
        a rule of HTML, or didn’t describe your content specifically enough. Fortunately
        there’s a tool called the Validator that can check your code for errors!\r

      Visual Accessibility_markdown_instruction: |-
        # Visual Accessibility: Color Contrast\r
        \r
        People
        need to be able to see and read the content on your web page for it to be
        useful. Not everyone will see your website the same way you do. Some people
        might have bad eye sight, others are color blind. How do you design with these
        differences in mind?\r
        \r
        One of the easiest ways to insure that many people
        will be able to read the content on your website is to make sure their is
        enough contrast between the different colors you are using together on your
        site. Contrast is the state of being strikingly different from something else.
        Check out the below example of contrasting colors.\r
        \r
        | Example 1 | Example
        2 |\r
        | --------- | --------- |\r
        |<img src="https://images.code.org/f4f8acab4c8fe45cddef0436c52084cf-image-1476231852248.jpg"

        style="width:200px"> |\r
        \r
        Stare at example 1 for a few seconds. You
        might notice that the edges of the text blur with the background or it feels
        like the image is pulsing. This is because the value of the colors is too
        close together. The second is definitely easier to look at because one color
        is dark and one is light.\r
        \r
        A way to test this is convert everything
        to grayscale. Notice how in the example below the example with contrasting
        colors is easier to view in grayscale.\r
        \r
        <img src="https://images.code.org/40be05f66945d5cf0fda69be95986a4a-image-1476232151166.jpg"
        style="width:300px">\r
        \r
        Contrast can be a powerful tool to use in your
        website. You can direct a users eye to a certain part of the page using contrast.
        Check out this page. Where is your eye drawn?\r
        \r
        <img src="https://images.code.org/63af145760dc94d66dfff8791c1dfe65-image-1476232407521.32.15

        \r
        Your answer is probably the orange
        buttons. Thats because those buttons have contrasting colors to the rest of
        the page which are lighter.\r
        \r
        # Do This\r
        \r
        * Use the <a href="http://contrastchecker.com/">
        color contrast checker </a> to see the difference in contrast of the different
        colors you are using together on your site. This website uses hex codes for
        colors. Remember that you can find the hex codes for your colors in your color
        information from lesson 10.\r
        * Click the "See Grayscale" button to see
        how well you can read the different text and background colors\r
        * Consider
        making changes to your color choices by darkening or lightening up certain
        colors to make them easier to read.\r

        Over time, they will see that different types of text require different\napproaches
        to compression. The lesson ends with an activity where students\ndevelop a
        heuristic, or a rule of thumb, that can be applied to different\npieces of
        text in order to compress them. \\r\n\\r\nThere are three Essential\nKnowledge
        Statements and one Exclusion Statement in the Framework dealing\nwith Heuristics:
        \\r\n\\r\n>- 4.2.1D Some problems can be solved but not in\na reasonable time.
        In these cases, heuristic approaches may be helpful to\nfind solutions in
        reasonable time. \\r\n- 4.2.2A A heuristic is a technique\nthat may allow
        us to find an approximate solution when typical methods fail\nto find an exact
        solution. \\r\n- 4.2.2B Heuristics may be helpful for finding\nan approximate
        solution more quickly when exact methods are too slow. \\r\n-\nExclusion Statement
        (4.2.2B): Specific heuristic solutions are beyond the\nscope of this course
        and the AP Exam.\\r\n\\r\nMany people are confused by the\ndifference between
        *algorithms* and *heuristics*. Check out the following\nresource for some
        clarification about the overlaps and differences between\nthe two. "

        **Directions:**\r
        \r
        *
        Encode an image of anything you like.\r
        * You might want to do some planning
        and sketching with graph paper first.\r
        * DO NOT simply make an abstract
        pattern, like a checkerboard. \r
        * Depict something, perhaps your name written
        out, your initials, an icon or logo of some sort.\r
        * Get creative! The image
        doesn't have to be a perfect square, it can be long and skinny.\r
        * Optional:
        for fun, send your image bits to a friend using the <a href ="https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit1/stage/11/puzzle/2"
        target="_blank">sending bits widget.</a> *(note: this is just a link to

        In the first week of this

        between the material and what I already know. That really helped me remember
        things. I also tried to not overdo it. I started taking small breaks in-between
        lessons and when I came back I checked if I still remembered what I was studying
        before. It helped a lot\r

        Computer science has changed the way we communicate

        At the start of the class I worried that I was different from
        the other students. I wasn't sure I fit in – I \tworried that I couldn’t
        do it and that the teacher and other students would look down on me. A few
        days after I started, I realized that almost everyone who takes the class
        isn’t sure if they fit in at first. It's something everyone goes through.
        Now it seems ironic – everybody feels different at first, when really we're
        all going through the same thing.</p>\r

        ## Starting out
        in Computer Science\r
        \r
        Computer science has changed the way we communicate
        with each other, make art and movies, grow food, and even treat illnesses.
        **Everyone can learn computer science and make a difference:** It really does
        not matter how much or little experience you have with computer science already,
        or what age, gender, or skin color you have.\r

        ## Quotes from
        students\r
        \r
        Still, we understand that it can be daunting at first to take
        a computer science course. So here are a few student quotes describing their
        experiences. **Please read the quotes carefully and respond to the prompt
        below**. \r

        At the start of the class I worried that I was different from
        the other students. I wasn't sure I fit in – I \tworried that I couldn’t
        do it and that the teacher and other students would look down on me. A few
        days after I started, I realized that almost everyone who takes the class
        isn’t sure if they fit in at first. It's something everyone goes through.
        Now it seems ironic – everybody feels different at first, when really we're
        all going through the same thing.</p>\r

        A
        programmer wants to write a procedure that calculates the net elevation -  total
        number of feet a traveler goes up and down. For example, looking at the first
        3 segments of travel, the net elevation is 7 feet (up 3, up 1, down 3).  \r
        \r
        Write
        procedure (in either JavaScript or pseudocode) called processPath(data) that:\r
        \r
        *
        Accepts a list of elevation data as a parameter\r

        \t* Add the difference to a running total\r
        * Return
        the total elevation traveled\r

        In writing your procedure you should assume

        **Short Answer:** Jimmy wrote

        in the range 0-100.  The procedure is supposed to return a letter grade. He
        feels confident his program is correct because he has tested it using the

        Teaching and Student Support Plan\r
        \r
        ## Task Description\r
        \r
        Now that
        you have a better sense of this lessons in this sequence, let’s think about
        the types of supports students will need in order to be successful. Since
        the curriculum is based on inquiry learning, lessons feature activities that
        engage students in discovering core concepts themselves. It’s important to
        think through implementation plans and student support. In this task you will
        make a plan for teaching and student support **for one of the lessons in this
        sequence** that takes into account differentiation strategies and make-up
        work for absent students. Your teaching and student support plan should cover
        the following: \r
        \r
        \r
        - **Which lesson in the sequence are you discussing?**
        \r
        \r
        - **Details on how you will implement and differentiate the lesson:**\r
        \r

        - An outline of any changes you will need to make to the lesson to fit your
        local constraints or context (for example: pacing and time, dealing with classroom
        setup, etc). \r
         - An overview of the types of student needs you’ll likely
        need to support in your classroom (for example: students who are struggling
        to understand the underlying concept; students who are already familiar with
        the concept, but still have room to learn more; etc)\r
         - Your plan for addressing
        each of the needs outlined above (for example: integrating extension activities
        or other materials for students who already know something about the topic)\r

        - How will you address or emphasize the connection between lessons in this
        sequence? \r
        \r
        <br>\r
        - **Plan for catching up absent students:**\r
        \r

        - How will absent students catch up on activities they missed? \r
         - How
        will you use the fact that the lessons in this sequence are related and build
        on one another to address make-up work? \r
        \r
        You can type out your teaching
        and student support plan in the box below, or you can upload a word doc or
        pdf file. \r

        #### Task
        Review Details\r
        \r
        If this module is listed as  your “focus area”, then
        your response to the prompt above will be shared anonymously and reviewed
        by your peers, and you will review the work done by other teachers. Reviewers
        will be looking for thoughtful and thorough answers that demonstrate that
        you have spent time considering how the lesson will play out in your own classroom.
        Reviewers will have an opportunity to give feedback on your submission, and
        you can respond to that feedback and resubmit. \r
        \r
        In order to get credit
        for completing this task, two reviewers need to agree that you have responded
        to the prompts fully. If reviewers don’t feel comfortable making a decision
        about your task submission, they can elevate to a facilitator to review. You
        will always have a chance to address feedback from your reviewers and resubmit
        your task! Reviewer feedback will show up at the bottom of this page, once
        it’s available. \r
