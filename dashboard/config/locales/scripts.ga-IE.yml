            na daltaí ríomhchláir, déanfaidh siad comhoibriú le daltaí eile, forbróidh
            siad scileanna réitigh fadhbanna, agus leanfaidh siad ar aghaidh in ainneoin
            deacrachtaí. Ag deireadh an chúrsa, cruthóidh gach dalta a chluiche féin
            nó a scéal féin is féidir a chomhroinnt. Dírithe ar aois 5-6.

          description: |
            In this unit, students extend their understanding of the internet and how it functions by building off the concepts learned when sending bits in Unit 1. The unit largely explores the
            structure and design of the internet and the implications of those design decisions including
            the reliability of network communication, the security of data, and personal privacy. Topics
            include the Internet Protocol (IP), DNS, TCP/IP, cryptography and other security and hacking
            concerns.

          description: Being able to digitally manipulate data, visualize it, identify
            patterns, trends and possible meanings are important practical skills
            that computer scientists do every day. The data rich world we live in
            also introduces many complex questions related to public policy, law,
            ethics and societal impact. Understanding where data comes from, having
            intuitions about what could be learned or extracted from it, and being
            able to use computational tools to manipulate data and communicate about
            it are the primary skills addressed in the unit.

          description: This unit further explores the ways that digital information
            is encoded, represented and manipulated. Being able to digitally manipulate
            data, visualize it, and identify patterns, trends and possible meanings
            are important practical skills that computer scientists do every day.
            Understanding where data comes from, having intuitions about what could
            be learned or extracted from it, and being able to use computational tools
            to manipulate data and communicate about it are the primary skills addressed
            in the unit.
