        Draw these 3 flowers. The first one's
        height is 100 and the next flower is always 50 pixels more than the height
        of the previous one. The flowers are also 100 pixels apart.
      4-5 Artist Patterns 1_instruction: |
        Can you draw this square using a loop?
        Each side is 20 pixels long.
      4-5 Artist Patterns 10_instruction: |
        This code draws two rows of hexagons -
        loop the whole thing 4 times to draw the whole honeycomb. Hint: You'll need
        to jump back 120 pixels in your outermost loop to make sure the artist doesn't
        draw off the screen.
      4-5 Artist Patterns 11_instruction: |
        How many times do you need to loop this
        to draw a half circle? Hint: if there's 360 degrees in a circle and each
        loop moves 3 degrees, how many times would you need to loop draw a full circle?
      4-5 Artist Patterns 12_instruction: |
        If you copy that loop and turn left instead
        of right, what happens? Can you repeat that to draw this wave?
      4-5 Artist Patterns 13_instruction: |
        Now let's loop that whole thing four
        times to create this picture frame. Watch out for the corners - you can't
        just turn 90 degrees! If looping a 3 degree turn 60 times makes a half circle,
        which of these blocks of code will make a quarter circle for the corners?
      4-5 Artist Patterns 2_instruction: |
        If you place your square loop inside another
        loop, we call that a nested loop. What do you need to add to your outer loop
        to make sure all 15 squares line up next to each other?
      4-5 Artist Patterns 3_instruction: |
        Now let's go one level deeper! We've
        nested that whole block of code into another loop, but you need to get the
        artist back in place to draw the next line. Which of these code blocks can
        you place at the end of the outermost loop to draw the whole grid?
      4-5 Artist Patterns 4_instruction: |

        How many times do you need to repeat
        this block to draw the full grid of diamonds?
      4-5 Artist Patterns 5_instruction: |
        Let's repeat that to make a row of 6 diamonds.
        Notice that we changed our diamond code to repeat 3 times instead of 2 - why
        do you think that is?
      4-5 Artist Patterns 6_instruction: |
        How many times do you need to repeat this
        block to draw the full grid of diamonds?
      4-5 Artist Patterns 7_instruction: |
        Let's modify the code from the last puzzle
        to make this more complex pattern. Notice how the diamonds overlap now, try
        changing the first "jump backwards" from 100 to 50 (half as far) - now how
        far should the artist go in the second "jump backwards"?
      4-5 Artist Patterns 8_instruction: |
        Use a loop to draw this hexagon with 40
        pixel sides and 60 degree angles.
      4-5 Artist Patterns 9.5_instruction: |
        Let's loop this code to draw two rows
        of hexagons. Notice how our second row is shifted to the right.
      4-5 Artist Patterns 9_instruction: |
        Now repeat that code 3 times do draw the
        whole row. Hint, each hexagon is 80 pixels wide from the furthest points left
        to right.

        You can call functions from inside other functions!
        Using your "shape" function as a base, create a new "house" function that
        takes a parameter "length"
      Artist Params 11_instruction: |
        How about a function called "pinwheel" that
        takes three parameters - "sides," "length" and "repeat." Your function
        function should draw a pinwheel of "repeat" shapes of "sides" and "length."
        You can calculate how much to turn after each shape using the same math you
        used to figure out the turns for a shape of "sides"
      Artist Params 12_instruction: |
        Use your "pinwheel" function to draw each
        of these shapes. The side length for each image is 50.
      Artist Params 13_instruction: |
        Freeplay: Here are the functions you've written,
        and some more for you to play with. Draw something awesome!
      Artist Params 2_instruction: |
        That triangle function would be a whole lot more
        useful if it could draw triangles of different sizes. I've added a parameter
        for line length, but it doesn't do anything yet. Can you update the function
        so it uses the "length" parameter when it draws each side?
      Artist Params 3_instruction: |
        Awesome, can you draw each of these triangles
        with that new function? The first is 25 pixels long, the second is 50, and
        the third is 75. (If you're really clever, you could use a for loop for this!)
      Artist Params 4_instruction: |
        Can you add a new function called square? It
        should also take a length parameter, just like the triangle.
      Artist Params 5_instruction: Use both of your new functions to draw this picture
      Artist Params 6_instruction: |
        Remember how we used a variable to set the number
        of sides for a shape? Why have two separate functions for "triangle" and
        "square", when we could have one "shape" function that takes two parameters
        - "sides" and "length"?
      Artist Params 7_instruction: |
        Draw several shapes and combinations of shapes
        using the generic shape function.
      Artist Params 8_instruction: |
        Can you figure out how to draw two triangles?
        Here's a hint create 2 new functions for each triangle.

        is called. The more you add to x, the faster the target will go.
      Big Game Animation 3_instruction: |
        The 'update-danger' function should work
        just like 'update-target', except that the danger should move from the right
        side over towards the left. Complete the 'update-danger' function to make
        the danger fly across the screen.
      Big Game Animation 4_instruction: |
        At this point your game your danger should
        run across the screen from right to left, and your target should run across
        from left to right. They don't ever come back on screen once they've left,
        but we'll take care of that later. Take a minute to make sure your game is
        working like you want it to, and then click finish to move on.
      Big Game Booleans 1_instruction: |
        When you last worked on your game we got
        our target and danger sprites to fly across the screen, but they never come
        back. Click run to see how your game is currently working, and then click
        finish and we'll work on making those sprites reappear on screen after they've
        left.
      Big Game Booleans 2_instruction: |
        Remember the safe-left? and safe-right? functions
        from Sam the Bat? We're going to use that same logic to figure out when the
        target and danger leave the screen. Go to the "Functions" section of the
        toolbox and complete the safe-left? function.
      Big Game Booleans 3_instruction: |
        Now that you've got safe-left?, let's fill
        in safe-right? - it should take in a sprite's x coordinate and return true
        if the sprite hasn't gone off the right side of the screen.
      Big Game Booleans 4_instruction: |
        Great, now that you have functions to check
        the left and right side of the screen, edit the on-screen? function so that
        it checks safe-left? AND safe-right?, just like you did with Sam the Bat.
      Big Game Booleans 5_instruction: |
        At this point your danger should run across
        the screen from right to left, your target should run across from left to
        right, and they should both return to the opposite side. Take a minute to
        make sure your game is working like you want it to, and then click finish
        to move on.
      Big Game Collision 1 (copy 1)_instruction: |
        When you last worked on your game
        we got our target and danger sprites to fly across the screen, but they never
        come back. Click run to see how your game is currently working, and then click
        finish and we'll work on making those sprites reappear on screen after they've
        left.
      Big Game Collision 1_instruction: |
        At this point you've programmed a video
        game with a moving target and danger, both of which return to the screen once
        they've left, and a player that responds to keyboard input. Click run to
        see how your game is currently working, and then we'll dig into the final
        missing piece - collision detection!
      Big Game Collision 2_instruction: |
        To move the player up and down, we'll need
        to use a conditional block to figure out which key is pressed and respond
        accordingly. Computers read keypresses as numeric key codes - the up arrow
        is 38 and the down arrow is 40. You can lookup other key codes in your student
        workbook. Edit the 'update-player' function so that if moves the player
        up when the up arrow is pressed, or down when the down arrow is pressed.
      Big Game Collision 3_instruction: |
        In order to know if two of our sprites are
        touching, we first need to measure the distance between their center points.
        Use the Pythagorean Theorem to complete this distance function so that it
        returns the distance between the player's center coordinates (px, py), and
        the center coordinates of another character (cx, cy). We've provided a working
        line-length function to help you out.
      Big Game Collision 4_instruction: |
        Now that you have a way to measure the distance
        between two points, you just need to decide when those points are close enough
        to be considered touching. Complete the 'collide?' function so that it checks
        the distance function and returns true if the two points are close enough
        to touch (100 pixels apart is a good place to start).

      Course 4 Artist For Loops 11_instruction: |
        Remember when we used a variable
        to control the number of sides in a shape? This pattern starts with a triangle
        and adds one side at a time until it draws a decagon (10 sides). Each side
        should be 100 pixels long. Hint: 360 divided by the number of sides a shape
        has is the number of degrees you'll need to turn.
      Course 4 Artist For Loops 12_instruction: "That looked pretty cool, but now\nI'd
        like to draw each shape next to the last one. This time each side is\n20 pixels.
        Use a jump block to jump forward 40 pixels after each shape. \n"
      Course 4 Artist For Loops 13_instruction: |
        Hmmm, those shapes are getting bigger
        every time! Didn't we already solve this problem with variables? How can
        we use the counter variable to make the sides smaller as there are more of
        them? Instead of moving forward by a set amount, try moving forward (100 /
        counter) pixels.
      Course 4 Artist For Loops 14_instruction: |
        If you turn a little bit more or
        less than you normally would for a shape, it creates a neat effect. Try turning
        89 degrees to create this twisted square spiral.

        Create a “draw a triangle function
        with 50 pixels sides” from scratch.
      Course 4 Artist Params 2_instruction: |
        That triangle function would be a whole
        lot more useful if it could draw triangles of different sizes. I've added
        a parameter for line length, but it doesn't do anything yet. Can you update
        the function so it uses the "length" parameter when it draws each side?
        The triangle sizes are 150 pixels, 75 pixels and 25 pixels.
      Course 4 Artist Params 3_instruction: "Awesome, can you draw each of these\ntriangles
        with that new function? The first is 25 pixels long, the second\nis 50, and
        the third is 75. \n"
      Course 4 Artist Params 4_instruction: |
        Can you add a new function called square?
        It should also take a length parameter, just like the triangle. This time
        draw 3 squares 25, 50 and 75 pixels in length,100 pixels apart.
      Course 4 Artist Params 5_instruction: |
        Use both of your new functions to draw
        this picture. To make this easier you use a loop with a "counter" parameter.
      Course 4 Artist Params 6_instruction: "Let's edit this \"draw a shape\" function.\nIt
        already has a \"length\" parameter. Now, let's edit the function to also\nadd
        a \"sides\" parameter. Remember the angle to turn for a given shape is\n360
        divided by the sides it has. Hint: lengths for each shape are the triangle\nis

        Can you figure out how to draw this
        shape? Here's a hint create a new function with 6 sides called a hexagon.
      Course 4 Artist Params 9_instruction: |
        Do you remember when we used the counter
        loop but removed a loop within? Let's have some fun and use the "draw a
        shape" function with "sides" and "length" parameters. Can you re create
        these shapes? The square counter should be 5/100/5, the triangle counter should
        be 10/100/10 and the hexagon is 2/100/2.
      Course 4 Artist Var 9_instruction: |
        Here's the algorithm to draw a triangle,
        modify it so it uses the "sides" variable instead. Replace the number 3
        with the "sides" variable. Hint: remember to use the "set sides to" block.
      Course 4 Artist Vars 1_instruction: |
        Can you help me draw a triangle? It's
        100 pixels long on each side.
      Course 4 Artist Vars 10_instruction: |
        Here's an algorithm that draws a triangle
        out of smaller triangles. Can you modify it so that it uses the "sides"
        variable to draw each triangle? Look through the code, and every time you
        see the number 3, replace it with your "sides" variable. Remember to use
        the "set sides" block.
      Course 4 Artist Vars 11_instruction: |
        Here's the same algorithm that we came
        up with for the last puzzle - what should you set the "sides" variable to
        in order to draw this picture of squares?
      Course 4 Artist Vars 12_instruction: |
        Let's set the "sides" variable to
        5. The more sides we add to this algorithm, the bigger this whole pattern
        gets! Let's add a new variable called "length" and use that wherever you
        have a "move forward." Set the "length" variable to 75 for this shape.
      Course 4 Artist Vars 13_instruction: |
        The more sides a shape has, the shorter
        each side needs to be in order for the whole pattern to fit on the screen.
        Instead of manually setting the "length" variable, let's use the "sides"
        variable and a math block to set the "length." Choose the correct equation
        from the toolbox to set the "length" variable, and also update the "sides"
        variable.
      Course 4 Artist Vars 14_instruction: |
        Free Play: Check it out, now your algorithm
        is nested within one more loop. Experiment with changing the values of the
        your two variables to draw cool patterns.
      Course 4 Artist Vars 2_instruction: |
        Instead of "moving forward by 100,"
        the "move" block is now referencing the variable "length." Can you set
        "length" to 150 to draw this new triangle?
      Course 4 Artist Vars 3_instruction: "Here's a loop that draws a square, but\nsomething's
        missing. Can you fix it so that it uses the variable \"length\"\nto figure
        out how long each side should be? \n"
      Course 4 Artist Vars 4_instruction: |
        Now I want to make a rectangle that is
        twice as tall as it is wide. We've got a variable called "width" that is
        set to 100. Can you use the math blocks to complete the code?
      Course 4 Artist Vars 5_instruction: |
        Use the variable "sides" to control
        how many times this loop gets run.
      Course 4 Artist Vars 6_instruction: |
        Hmmm, I tried changing the "sides" variable
        to 4 from the code in the last puzzle, but it's still drawing a triangle.
        Can you use the "sides" variable (along with a math block) to make sure
        that I turn the right amount too? Hint: 360 divided by the number of sides
        will give you the number of degrees to turn.
      Course 4 Artist Vars 7_instruction: |
        Can you modify the "sides" variable
        to help me draw this hexagon?
      Course 4 Artist Vars 8_instruction: "Free Play: Experiment with the number\nof
        sides this shape has. Can you change the algorithm so that the overall\nsize
        of the shape stays the same, no matter how many sides it has? Hint: You\nmight
        have to use your math blocks (360 divided by \"sides\" in two places\nthis
        time) \n"
      Course 4 Artist Vars 9_instruction: |
        Modify this algorithm so it uses the "sides"
        variable instead of a fixed number to draw a triangle. Replace the number
        3 with the "sides" variable, and use the "set sides to" block.
      Course 4 Bee 1_instruction: "The bee can't tell if this is a flower or a honeycomb.\nCheck
        first if it is a flower or a honeycomb, and then only gather nectar\nfrom
        it if it is a flower. \n"
      Course 4 Bee 2_instruction: |
        Check each of the objects to see if it's a flower
        - if it is, collect nectar.
      Course 4 Bee 3_instruction: |
        The unknown object is either a flower or a honeycomb.
        Use the if/else block to collect nectar if it is a flower, else make honey
        (because then it would be a honeycomb).
      Course 4 Bee 4_instruction: |
        This purple flower may have either 3, 2, or 1
        nectar. Here an if-else block is combined with another if-else block to create
        an if, else-if, else block. Complete the solution to collect the unknown amount
        of nectar.
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 1_instruction: |
        Use a loop to collect the nectar from
        each flower.
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 10_instruction: |
        If your loop is counting down, the
        increment is subtracted from your counter variable each loop. What should
        your increment be to collect 9, then 6, and then 3 nectar?
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 2_instruction: |
        Here's a new kind of loop, called the
        "for" loop. This particular for loop will count from 1 to 5 by 1, and run
        the contents of the loop each time it counts. Help the Bee get the nectar.
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 3_instruction: |
        You can solve this puzzle by using a
        for loop to count from 1 to 3 by 1. Now let's go get some nectar!
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 4_instruction: |
        Collect all of the nectar from these
        flowers. I wonder if there's an easier way to do this...
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 5_instruction: "Ah, the for loop makes this much easier!\nUsing
        the \"counter\" variable from the for loop to loop the \"get nectar\"\nblock
        the same number of times as the loop. Whew! That's a lot of loops.\nAll the

        on Run and see how it works. \n"
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 6_instruction: |
        You can also use a for loop to count
        down. Try gathering this nectar by counting down from 5 to 1 by 1.
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 7_instruction: |
        Use your for loop "counter" variable
        to control how far to move horizontally.
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 8_instruction: |
        Can you use the loop variable to control
        movement and nectar collection?
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 9_instruction: |
        The last number in your for loop is
        called the "increment,"  and each time the loop is run the counter variable
        changes by the increment. Try collecting these flowers using an increment
        of 2.
      Course 4 Bee Params 1_instruction: |
        Use the function "get 3 nectar" which
        turns, moves to collect the nectar, and then returns to the original location.
        Write a sequence to collect all of the nectar using "get 3 nectar."
      Course 4 Bee Params 2_instruction: |
        Modify the "get 3 nectar" function so
        it makes me turn right instead of left to the flowers.
      Course 4 Bee Params 3 (copy 1)_instruction: |
        Now there are flowers on both
        sides! Maybe you can use a parameter so that the same function works for flowers
        on either side. I've added a parameter called "direction" to the function.
        If the "direction" parameter equals 0 I should turn left, if it's 1 I should
        turn right.
      Course 4 Bee Params 3_instruction: |
        Now there are flowers on both sides! I've
        added a parameter called "direction" to the function. Use the "left" and
        "right" variables to control direction. Fill in the rest of the function
        definition and then click "Save and Close."
      Course 4 Bee Params 4 (copy 1)_instruction: |
        Try using your new function to
        collect all of the flowers. Remember, 0 = left and 1 = right.
      Course 4 Bee Params 4 backup_instruction: |
        Wouldn't it be nice if we could
        collect all of these nectars with the a single function? Try adding a new
        parameter to your function called "nectars" to control the amount of nectar
        to collect. You'll probably want to rename the function too!
      Course 4 Bee Params 4_instruction: |
        Try using your new function to collect
        all of the flowers. Remember to use the left and right variables.
      Course 4 Bee Params 5_instruction: |

        This time, let's try counting
        the odd numbers from 1 to 100.
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 1 (copy 1)_instruction: |
        Here's a function called
        "jump" that causes your main character to jump up 100 pixels. Use the jump
        function to collect all of the flags.
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 1_instruction: |
        Here's a function called "jump"
        that causes your main character to jump up 100 pixels. Use the jump function
        to collect all of the flags.
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 10_instruction: |
        We've added one last function for
        you to use. Program your game to call the "level_up" function if "player_points"
        > 10. Play the game, and make it past level 4 to move to the next puzzle.
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 2 (copy 1)_instruction: |
        Now we've got flags that
        are too high for our current jump! Let's add a parameter to our jump function
        called "height." The up arrow should jump 100 pixels, but the down arrow
        should jump 300 pixels. Watch out, you don't want to hit the <future barrier
        above lower flags>!
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 2_instruction: |
        Now we've got flags that are too
        high for our current jump! Let's add a parameter to our jump function called
        "height." The up arrow should jump 200 pixels, but the down arrow should
        jump 100 pixels. Click "edit" on the jump function and update it so that
        it uses the height parameter instead of just jumping 100 pixels.
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 3_instruction: "Let's add another parameter to the\njump
        function so that we can use it with other actors. Each actor is represented\nby
        a number, starting from one. Edit the \"jump\" function so that the definition\nincludes
        the \"actor\" parameter. \n"
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 4_instruction: |
        Here's a function called "patrol."
        Edit it to move the Cat up 400 pixels and then down 400 pixels.
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 5_instruction: |
        Fill in the "actor" parameter input
        so that we can call the "patrol" function for each of the actors. Remember,
        the actors correspond to numbers 1, 2, and 3.
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 6_instruction: |
        Add another parameter called "speed"
        to the "patrol" function. Use a "set speed" block with the new "speed"
        parameter.
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 7_instruction: |
        Use the arrow keys to control the
        Dog and collect all of the flags.
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 8_instruction: |
        Use a "when touching" block to send
        the Dog back to the top-left if the Dog touches any of the other actors.

        This race seems a bit unfair,
        try to get to the cat before the penguin does!
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 1_instruction: |
        You don't have to write any code, just
        hit "run" to play the game! In this game, you're the Dog who is trying
        to collect more flags than the Cat. Use the down arrow to control the Dog.
        Press "Finish" when you're done playing.
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 2_instruction: |
        That race wasn't very fair! Change

      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 4_instruction: |
        Now we're using a variable called "height"
        to control how high the dog can jump. Update the "height" variable so that
        the dog can jump high enough to reach all the flags. Hint: the new flags are
        200 pixels high.
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 5_instruction: "Let's build a game! First we'll need\na

        Cool, now we've got our score
        variable, but how are we going to make it useful? How about adding to your
        score variable each time you hit the enemy with a fireball? Use the "when
        actor 2 touches anything" event to trigger an update to your score when your
        fireballs hit the cat. You can increment the score by setting score = score
        + 1. Get your score up to 10 (going one at a time!) to pass the level.
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 6_instruction: |
        In our game, how should we score points?
        Add 1 to your "points" variable each time the Dog hits the Cat with a fireball.
        Use the "when actor 2 touches anything" event to trigger an update to your
        score. You can increment your variable by setting "points = points + 1."

        "starburst" returns a yellow radial star with given points, and an inner
        radius that is half the outer radius.
      Eval Design Recipe 5_instruction: |
        Using the Design Recipe, write a function
        "striped-flag" that takes two colors and produces a flag that is 250 pixels
        wide, 150 pixels tall, with three even horizontal stripes of given colors,
        in the order color2, color1, color2.
      Eval Design Recipe 6_instruction: |
        Using the Design Recipe, write a function
        "large-polygon" that should output a polygon of given sides and color that
        takes up most of the window, regardless of the number of sides. To make sure
        that the polygon doesn't get too large as you increase the number of sides,
        side length should be inversely proportional to side number, with a length
        of (800/sides).

      Eval Strings Images .1_instruction: |
        So far we've only dealt with a single
        type of data, Numbers. Another type of data is a String, which is any combination
        of letters, numbers, or other characters wrapped in quotation marks. Run the
        String "Hello, world!" and see what happens.
      Eval Strings Images .2_instruction: |
        The "string-append" function takes two
        Strings and returns a single combined String. Add a String "Universe" to
        the second argument of "string-append."
      Eval Strings Images 1_instruction: |
        The third type of data we're going to
        use is an Image. This "star" function takes in a Number and two Strings,
        and it outputs an Image. Use this function to make a solid red star with radius
        of 100.
      Eval Strings Images 2_instruction: |
        Free Play: Every Evaluation Block is color-coded
        to let you know which data type it returns and which types it needs for its
        parameters. The last parameter of the triangle function takes a String that
        controls its color - try some different colors to see what works.
      Eval Strings Images 3_instruction: |
        Some functions can only take a specific
        set of Strings, such as the second argument of this circle function, which
        controls its style. Draw this orange outline circle using the special String
        block with a dropdown to make sure you only use valid styles.
      Eval Strings Images 4_instruction: |

        Try using this new Evaluation Block called
        "overlay" to place a 100 pixel white triangle on top of a 200 pixel red
        circle.
      Eval Strings Images 6_instruction: |
        Use the overlay function to place a 75
        pixel radius yellow star on top of a 150 pixel long blue square.
      Eval Strings Images 7_instruction: |
        The "offset" block lets you move an image
        relative to the center of the playspace, where it would normally be placed.
        Use this block to offset the triangle by 80 pixels on the y axis.
      Eval Strings Images 8_instruction: |
        Here's a different kind of star block
        - it's called "radial-star" and it allows you to draw stars with any number
        of points! Use it to create a solid orange star with an inner radius of 75
        pixels and an outer radius of 175 pixels.

      Sam the Butterfly 1 (copy 1)_instruction: |
        This butterfly is named Sam, and
        the game area is Sam’s yard. Sam's yard is 400 pixels wide by 400 pixels
        tall! As you can see, Sam is free to walk around the yard, and the coordinates
        at the top of the screen update to tell you his location. Use the arrow keys
        to move sam around his yard. Help Sam collect all of the flags to move on.
      Sam the Butterfly 1_instruction: |
        This bat is named Sam, and the game area
        is Sam’s yard. Sam's yard is 400 pixels wide by 400 pixels tall! As you can
        see, Sam is free to walk around the yard, and the coordinates at the top of
        the screen update to tell you his location. Use the arrow keys to move sam
        around his yard. Help Sam collect all of the flags to move on.
      Sam the Butterfly 2_instruction: |
        Sam's mom wants to make sure that she can
        always see at least a bit of him, so lets write some functions that help make
        sure he doesn't go too far out of the yard. Here's a function called "safe-left?"
        - it should take a Number for its domain that represents Sam's x-coordinates
        and return true if he's inside the left boundary of the yard (x > -25). If
        your function works, Sam shouldn't be able to leave the yard from the left
        side.
      Sam the Butterfly 3_instruction: |
        In the last puzzle we kept Sam from leaving
        on the left, now let's do the same thing on the right. Fill out the "safe-right?"
        function to make sure Sam can't go past x = 425.
      Sam the Butterfly 4_instruction: |
        Huh, we can keep Sam from leaving on the
        left, or we can keep him from leaving on the right, but how can we keep him
        from going either direction? Try using the "AND" block to program the function
        "on-screen?" to check if Sam is safe-left? AND safe-right?
      Sam the Butterfly 5_instruction: |
        Free Play: Awesome, now Sam can't leave
        the yard from the left or the right, but what about up and down? We've added
        an additional parameter 'y' to the 'onscreen?' function. Can you update
        your program so Sam can't leave from the top (y = 425) or bottom (y = -25)
        either? Test your program by moving Sam as far as he can go in all four directions.
        Click Finish when Sam is completely protected.
      Sam the Butterfly 6_instruction: |
        We've added a new parameter "y" to the
        "on-screen?" function. Update the function so that it checks that "safe-left?"
        AND "safe-right?" AND "safe-up?" are all true. When you've fixed the
        function, try going out of the yard from the left, right, and top sides.
      Sam the Butterfly 7 (copy 1)_instruction: |
        Only one last direction to worry
        about! Create a "safe-down?" function and update the "on-screen?" function
        so that it checks up, down, left, and right.
      Sam the Butterfly 7_instruction: |
        Only one last direction to worry about! Create
        a "safe-down?" function and update the "on-screen?" function so that it
        checks up, down, left, and right.
      Sam the Butterfly Complete_instruction: |

        Can you complete this puzzle by writing out "Hello World!"
        in solid red text that is 40 pixels in size?
      snowflake base_instruction: Create these 3 lines that are 45 degrees apart
      snowflake branch_instruction: |
        Now let's make each line 30 pixels long. Create
        the first branch of a snowflake by repeating the 3 line pattern three times.
      snowflake full_instruction: |
        Create a snowflake by repeating a snowflake branch
        8 times
      snowflower pattern_instruction: |
        What beautiful snowflowers! Let's make smaller
        snowflowers to cover the entire ice rink.
      snowflower_instruction: "Intricate patterns can be created in the snow with\njust
        simple shapes like small and large circles. Can you create a pattern\nwith
        a 5 pixel and 10 pixel circle, repeating them 5 times in a circle? \n"
      square iterative_instruction: |
        Seems like we're halfway to making a square.
        Create 4 lines to draw a square.
      square loop_instruction: |
        There is more than one way to make a square. Can
        you use the Repeat block to create the square again, but with fewer blocks?
        What pattern do you see repeating, that you can put inside the Repeat block?
      square snowflake_instruction: |
        Once you know how to make a simple shape like
        a square, you can use it to draw beautiful snow flakes. Can you create a snowflake
        using the repeat block to draw a square 10 times, turning 36 degrees between
        each square?
      Standalone_Artist_1_instruction: |
        Welcome to Artist! First off, let's try
        to make a simple square using the turn right block and move forward block.
        Each side should be 100 pixels long.
      Standalone_Artist_2_instruction: |
        Draw this diamond with 120 and 60 degree
        angles and 150 pixel long sides.
      Standalone_Artist_3_instruction: |
        Can you draw this hexagon with 100 pixel
        sides and 60 degree turns?
      Standalone_Artist_4_instruction: |
        Now you've got a new block to play with,
        the loop. This will repeat a set of commands. What happens if you loop these
        commands 6 times?
      Standalone_Artist_5.5_instruction: |
        Notice how we simplified the diamond code
        by turning it into a loop. You can loop that whole sequence 12 times to draw
        the flower. Hint: You'll need to turn 30 degrees after your diamond loop
        so you don't keep drawing over the same diamond.
      Standalone_Artist_5_instruction: |
        How many times do you need to loop this diamond
        to draw the flower?
      Standalone_Artist_6_instruction: |
        Loop this hexagon code 6 times to create
        the design. How many degrees will you need to turn each time? Hint: divide
        the number of degrees in a circle by the number of times you are looping.
      Standalone_Artist_7_instruction: |
        A function is another programming tool to
        help you avoid repeating yourself. This function draws a flower, so you can
        use it any time you want to draw a flower. Use this and the new jump block
        to draw these flowers. Hint: The flowers are 150 pixels apart
      Standalone_Artist_8_instruction: |
        Here's a function called "Draw a shape"
        that we've programmed to draw hexagons. Run the code to see what it does
        and then experiment with the function to see what happens. Can you make it
        draw a pattern of squares, triangles, or octagons?
      Standalone_Artist_9_instruction: |
        Now go ahead and make whatever picture you'd
        like! You've even got an empty function that you can make do whatever you
        want!
      Standalone_Artist_v2_instruction: |
        Welcome to Artist! First off, let's try
