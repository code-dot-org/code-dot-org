      4-5 Artist Patterns 2: If you place your square loop inside another loop, we
        call that a nested loop. What do you need to add as an outer loop to make
        sure all 15 squares line up next to each other?
      4-5 Artist Patterns 3: Now let's go one level deeper! We've nested that whole
        block of code into another loop, but you need to get the artist back in place
        to draw the next line. Which of these code blocks can you place at the end
        of the outermost loop to draw the whole grid?
      4-5 Artist Patterns 4: This diamond has 50 pixel sides and angles of 120 and
        60 degrees. Use a loop to draw it.
      4-5 Artist Patterns 5: "Repeat this code to make a row of 6 diamonds. \n\nNotice
        that we changed our diamond code to repeat 3 times instead of 2 - why do you
        think that is?"
      4-5 Artist Patterns 6: How many times do you need to repeat this block to draw
        the full grid of diamonds?
      4-5 Artist Patterns 7: Let's modify the code from the last puzzle to make this
        more complex pattern. Notice how the diamonds overlap now, try changing the
        first "jump backwards" from 100 to 50 (half as far) - now how far should the
        artist go in the second "jump backwards"?
      4-5 Artist Patterns 8: Use a loop to draw this hexagon with 40 pixel sides and
        60 degree angles.
      4-5 Artist Patterns 9: "Now repeat this code 3 times and draw the whole row.
        \n\nEach hexagon is 80 pixels wide from the furthest points left to right."
      4-5 Artist Patterns 9.5: Let's loop this code to draw two rows of hexagons.

        Here is the code for an interesting shape.  What happens when you repeat it multiple times, turning between each iteration?   Notice that the turns in this shape add up to 420 degrees, which means that when your artist is done drawing, it will be facing a different direction than when you started.  That new direction is exactly 60 degrees to the right of where you began.
      Course 4 Artist 11: Now for a challenge!  Feel free to use trial and error.

      Course 4 Artist 3: Try to figure out what happens if you run this code (or press
        "Run" to test it). Then, repeat it enough times to complete the drawing.
      Course 4 Artist 4: How many degrees are in a circle?  Fill in the repeat block
        with that number to create a circle of colors.
      Course 4 Artist 5: 'Draw the other half of this design so it''s symmetrical.
        The triangles are equilateral and are 50 pixels long. Hint: You may have to

        added.'
      Course 4 Artist 6: Complete the code to draw these three, equilateral triangles.
      Course 4 Artist 7: 'Now nest this loop inside another loop to draw 10 triangles.
        This is called a nested loop. Hint: All 10 triangles complete a 360 degree
        rotation.  '
      Course 4 Artist 8: Draw this sun by looping this whole block of code multiple
        times.
      Course 4 Artist 8a: Remember this shape?  Now we're going to let you build it
        without giving you any blocks to start!

        50 pixels wide.
      Course 4 Artist For Loops 11: 'Remember back in a previous stage when we used
        a variable to control the number of sides in a shape? We are going to do the
        same thing with the `counter` variable now. This pattern starts with a triangle
        and adds one side at a time until it draws a decagon (10 sides). Each side
        should be 100 pixels long. '
      Course 4 Artist For Loops 11a: |-
        Let's put it all together!  Using your knowledge of `for` loops and the `counter` variable, create this drawing where each shape has two more sides than the last.  Make sure that each side is 10 times as long as the number of sides in the polygon.

        Very little of the code has been provided for you.
      Course 4 Artist For Loops 14: If you turn a little bit more or less than you
        normally would for a shape, it creates a neat effect. Try using some of the
        code from the last level, but turning 89 degrees to create this twisted square
        spiral.
      Course 4 Artist For Loops 15: 'Free Play: Try making some drawings of your own
        using "for loops". We''ve added a few useful variables for you as well.'

      Course 4 Artist Vars 1: "Let's draw an equilateral triangle. \n\nIt has to be
        exactly 100 pixels long on each side."
      Course 4 Artist Vars 11: Here’s more complicated code using the same concepts
        from the last puzzle - what should you set the "sides" variable to in order
        to draw this picture made of squares?
      Course 4 Artist Vars 12: Let's set the "sides" variable to 5. The more sides
        we add to this algorithm, the bigger this whole pattern gets! Notice that
        there is another variable called "length". We can now use that wherever we
        have a "move forward." Set the "length" variable to 75 for this shape.
      Course 4 Artist Vars 13: "When a shape has lots of sides, each side needs to
        be shorter if you want the whole pattern to fit on the screen. \nLet's recreate
        the algorithm for this amazing pattern, but instead of manually setting the
        `length` variable, let's use a math block with the `sides` variable inside
        to make sure that each shape fits correctly. The perimeter of each polygon
        is 300 pixels.\nNeed some hints?  Click here."
      Course 4 Artist Vars 14: |-
        Free Play: Check it out! Now your algorithm is nested within one more loop. Experiment with changing the values of your two variables to draw cool patterns.

        For even more effect, try playing with color!  Use random colors inside loops to see how it changes your design.
      Course 4 Artist Vars 2: Instead of using "move forward by 150," the "move" block
        is now referencing a variable called "length." Can you set "length" to 150
        to draw this new triangle?
      Course 4 Artist Vars 4: Now I want to make a rectangle that is twice as tall
        as it is wide. We've got a variable called "width" that needs to be set to
        100. Can you use the math blocks to complete the code?
      Course 4 Artist Vars 6: |-
        Here’s some code that can draw any regular polygon. There’s a new variable called sides that is set to 4. Can you use the sides variable (along with the math block) to turn the right amount regardless of how many sides there are in the polygon?

        Click here to go back to the hint!
      Course 4 Artist Vars 7: |-
        Use what you learned in the last puzzle to create this hexagon using the "sides" variable.

        See how you could change just one value to draw a triangle,  square, pentagon, or octagon?
      Course 4 Artist Vars 8: 'Free Play: Experiment with the number of sides this
        shape has. Can you change the algorithm so that the overall size of the shape
        stays the same, no matter how many sides it has? Hint: If you divide your
        starting length by the number of sides, the length of each side will get shorter
        as the number of sides gets higher.'
      Course 4 Bee 1: "The bee can't tell what's under the cloud! \n\nUse the `if`
        block to check whether there is a flower under the cloud. \n\nGet nectar one
        time, ONLY if there is a flower."
      Course 4 Bee 2: Use the "if/else" block to check each object to see if it's
        a flower or a honeycomb . If it's a flower, collect one nectar...otherwise,
        make one honey!
      Course 4 Bee 3: The unknown object is either a flower or a honeycomb. This time,
        use the if/else block to collect one nectar if it is a flower, else make one
        honey (because then it would be a honeycomb).
      Course 4 Bee Loops 5 NEW: Here are three flowers. Can you find the pattern of
        instructions that you need to repeat 3 times to collect the nectar with the
        fewest number of blocks?
      Course 4 Bee Loops 5a NEW: Now, use loops to help the bee collect all the nectar
        on its way to the honeycomb with as few blocks as possible.  When you get
        there, don't forget to make honey!
      Course 4 Bee Params 1: Write a sequence to collect all of the nectar using `get
        3 nectar` which turns, moves to collect the nectar, and then returns to the
        original location.
      Course 4 Bee Params 2: Modify the "get 3 nectar" function so it makes me turn
        right instead of left to the flowers.
      Course 4 Bee Params 3: 'Now there are flowers on both sides! We''ve added variables
        called "left" and "right" for you to use, and added a parameter called "direction"
        to "get 3 nectar". Edit "get 3 nectar" so that the bee turns the correct direction
        when the variables "left" or "right" are passed into the function.  '
      Course 4 Bee Params 4: Try using your new function to collect nectar from all
        of the flowers. Remember to use the left and right variables.
      Course 4 Bee Params 5: Magsisimula tayo sa wala - maaari ka bang maglikha ng
        bagong function na tinatawag na "get 5 nectar" na may direksyon na parameter?
      Course 4 Bee Params 6: Wouldn't it be nice if we could collect all of these
        nectars with a single function? Try adding a new parameter to your function
        called "nectar units" to control the amount of nectar to collect. You'll probably
        want to rename the function too!
      Course 4 Bee Params 7: Try using your new function to collect all of this nectar.
      Course 4 Bee Params 8: 'Challenge: Now there''s honey to deal with too! Rewrite
        your function to use both the number of honey units and the number of nectar

        main character to jump up 100 pixels. Run the program and use the jump function
        to collect all of the flags by moving the dog with the arrow keys.
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 10: "We've added one last function for you. \n\nUse
        an \"if\" statement to program your game to call the \"level\\_up\" function
        only when \"player\\_score\" becomes greater than a certain number.\n\nFor
        example: \"player\\_score\" > 6\n\nPlay the game, and make it to level 3 to
        move to the next puzzle. "
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 2: "Now we've got flags that are too high for our current
        jump! Let's use both the \"up\" and \"down\" arrows so that we can have multiple
        jump heights.  \n\nWe need to add a parameter to our jump function called
        \"height\".  The up arrow should cause the dog to jump 200 pixels and the
        down arrow should make it jump only 100 pixels. "
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 3: 'We have added another parameter to the jump function
        so that we can use it with other actors. Each actor is represented by a number,
        starting from one. Edit the "jump" function so that it uses the "actor" parameter
        to make the correct character jump. '
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 4: "Here's a function called `patrol`. \n\nEdit `patrol`
        to move Cat up 400 pixels and then down 400 pixels."
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 5: Edit the the "patrol" function to add an "actor"
        parameter, so that we can call it for each of the actors on the screen. Remember,
        the actors correspond to numbers 1, 2, and 3.
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 6: Add another parameter called "speed" to the "patrol"
        function. Try using a "set speed" block with the new "speed" parameter to
        help Penguin get both flags before the other sprites even get one.

        Let's have some fun! Look at the code provided to see if you can figure out what each block does.\

        NOTE: You don't need to make any changes to the program
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 8: Use the `when actor touches` block to send Dog back
        to the top-left ONLY if Dog touches any of the other actors.

        of the code is hidden. There’s a new function `score_points.`\n\nEdit the
        function so that a new parameter called `points` can be added to `player_score`.

        pie, and decrease each time that Cat tags Dog with a sandwich.\n\nNote: When
        you're done, click \"Run\" to play.  When Dog scores 6 points, you will move
        on to the next puzzle. "
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 1: This time you don't have to write any code, just hit
        "Run" to play the game! In this game, you're the dog who is trying to collect
        more flags than the cat. Use the down arrow to control the dog. Press "Finish"
        when you're done playing.
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 2: The race in that last puzzle wasn't very fair! Change
        the `dog_speed` variable to make sure you can collect more flags than Cat.
        The first to collect 10 flags wins!
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 3: Use the left and right arrows to move, and the up
        arrow to jump. See if you can collect all of the flags.
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 4: Now we're using a variable called "height" to control
        how high the dog can jump. Update the "height" variable so that the dog can
        jump high enough to reach all the flags.
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 5: 'Let''s build a game! First we''ll need a score. Rebuild

        Use the right arrow to throw pie.

        In our game, how should we score points? Add 1 to your "points" variable each time Dog hits Cat with a piece of pie. Use the "when actor 2 touches anything" event to trigger an update to your score. You can increment your variable by setting "points = points + 1." Get your score up to 10 (going one at a time!) to pass the level.
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 7: Nice, now let's make sure this game isn't too easy
        to play. Any time Dog (actor 1) gets hit by a sandwich from Cat (actor 2),
        you should lose a point. Start with 10 points so it's not too hard. Let your
        score drop down from 10 to 0 to pass the level.

      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 6: The last number in your for loop is called the
        "increment". Each time the loop is run, the counter variable changes by the
        value of the increment. Try collecting these flowers using an increment of
        2.

      Pixelation - Lesson 15 - Color Shades: We start you out with the row of shades
        of red that Maddie created in the video. Experiment with 6-bit color by filling
        in the bottom row of the image with shades of a different color. Here is an
        example with some shades of blue. Try your own color!
      Pixelation - Lesson 15 - Color Shades 4x4: 'We start you out with the 4x4 image
        Maddie created in the video. Your task is to fill a 4x4 grid with colors using
        12-bits per pixel. Here are the requirements: Row 1 - fill with shades of
        red. Row 2 - shades of green. Row 3 - shades of blue. Row 4 - shades of gray.'
      Pixelation - Lesson 15 - Complete 3-bit color: We start you with the 4x2 image
        Maddie was creating, but we've left out the last two squares. Finish off the
        image by figuring out which two colors are missing and encode them.
      Pixelation 4x4 Empty: The width and height are now encoded in the pixel data.
        Can you figure out how to adjust the dimensions?
      Pixelation Bee: 'This larger image of a bee encodes color with 12 bits per pixel,
        but viewing in hex makes it easier to see the color of each pixel. If you
        switch to binary mode - hold on to your hat - it''s a lot of bits. Here''s
        another mind-blowing thing to try: slide the bits per pixel up to 24 bits
        per pixel. What happens? Can you explain this behavior?'
      Pixelation Flappy: Here is a bigger image at 9 bits per pixel. With 9 bits per
        pixel you can express 512 different colors. Click through to see the next
        image which is even more sophisticated, but easier to understand.

      Standalone_Artist_1: Maligayang pagdating sa Artist! Una, subukan nating gumawa
        ng isang simpleng parisukat gamit ang turn right na bloke at move forward
        na bloke. Bawat gilid ay dapat 100 pixels ang haba.
      Standalone_Artist_2: Draw this diamond with 120 and 60 degree angles and 150
        pixel long sides.
      Standalone_Artist_3: Can you draw this hexagon with 100 pixel sides and 60 degree
        turns?
      Standalone_Artist_4: Ngayon ay mayroon ka nang bagong bloke para paglaruan,
        ang loop. Ito ay mag-uulit sa isang hanay ng mga utos. Ano ang mangyayari
        kung i-loop mo ang mga utos na ito nang 6 na beses?
      Standalone_Artist_5: Ilang beses mo kailangan ulitin ang pagguhit ng dyamanteng
        ito upang makaguhit ng bulaklak?
      Standalone_Artist_5.5: 'Notice how we simplified the diamond code by turning
        it into a loop. You can loop that whole sequence 12 times to draw the flower.
        Hint: You''ll need to turn 30 degrees after your diamond loop so you don''t
        keep drawing over the same diamond.'
      Standalone_Artist_6: 'Loop this hexagon code 6 times to create the design. How
        many degrees will you need to turn each time? Hint: divide the number of degrees
        in a circle by the number of times you are looping.'
      Standalone_Artist_7: 'A function is another programming tool to help you avoid
        repeating yourself. This function draws a flower, so you can use it any time
        you want to draw a flower. Use this and the new jump block to draw these flowers.
        Hint: The flowers are 150 pixels apart'
      Standalone_Artist_8: Narito ang isang function na tinatawag na "Draw a shape"
        na ating ginawa para gumuhit ng mga hexagon. Patakbuhin ang code para makita
        kung ano ang ginagawa nito at pagkatapos ay mag-eksperimento sa function para
        makita kung ano ang mangyayari. Maaari mo bang magawa ito para gumuhit ng
        isang pattern ng mga parisukat, mga tatsulok, o mga oktagon?
      Standalone_Artist_9: Now go ahead and make whatever picture you'd like! You've
        even got an empty function that you can make do whatever you want!
