        title: Panimula sa Computer Science
        desc: Ipinapakilala ng araling ito ang konsepto ng Computer Science at ipinapaliwanag
          kung ano ang ginagawa ng Computer scientist. Sa katapusan ng activity na
          ito, ang mga mag-aaral ay may pagkakataon upang malaman ang papel na ginagampanan
          ng isang computer scientist. Sa katapusang activity na ito, bawat mag-aaral
          ay magkakaroon ng isang paalala kung ano ang kanyang natutunan. Maaari kang
          matukso upang laktawan ang pagtuturo sa mga bata sa bokabularyo ng mga salita
          na nauugnay sa mga aralin na susunod, ngunit ang pagtatanghal sa mga ito
          sa isang masaya at mapaglarong paraan ay mas produktibo kaysa sa paghihintay
          para sa higit pang advanced na mga pagkakataon.

        title: Computational Thinking
        desc: With nothing but paper and markers, students will learn the four steps
          of computational thinking. After a brief introduction, students should be
          split into groups where they will have to create directions for other students
          to draw a specific monster (from a catalog of pre-selected monsters). The
          entire task must be decomposed, then teams will analyze all monsters in
          the catalog for patterns, abstract different details from the monsters,
          then use that information to create an algorithm (directions) for another
          team to draw a certain monster. Teams will then switch algorithms with another
          group and draw the monster based on what that algorithm indicates. Is the
          drawing what the original team intended?

        title: Graph Paper Programming
        desc: By programming one another to draw pictures, students will begin to
          understand what programming is really about. The class will begin by students
          instructing each other to color squares in on graph paper in an effort to
          reproduce an existing picture.  If there's time, the lesson can conclude
          with images that the students create themselves.

        title: Mga algorithm
        desc: This lesson covers algorithms.  Using tangram shapes and graph paper,
          the first exercise will show how important it is to make each instruction
          as clear and unambiguous as possible.  Afterward, the class will explore
          how many ways you can fold paper into a rectangle, noting how some methods
          can take more or fewer folds than others.

        title: Mga function
        desc: In this lesson, students will make a suncatcher out of string, beads,
          and a special charm. The students will follow a series of repetitive steps,
          then be asked to identify certain sets of "skills" that are duplicated several
          times. Once those skills are defined, they will be called from a main program
          and the whole beautiful process of creation will be recorded on a single
          sheet of paper. The final program will be geared toward the entire class,
          whatever their type of string, beads, and charms. To effectively allow for
          this, students will need to "abstract out" the details of their specific
          materials and create vague terms for an individual's supplies.  This use
          of generic placeholders is a wonderful introduction to variables.

        desc: Reading lyrics is a pretty intuitive venture for most students.  We'll
          take an activity that's already common knowledge and shift it into a solid
          education on defining and calling functions. Once students are familiar
          with the define/call process, we will add the extra capabilities that come
          along with passing parameters within those function calls.

        title: Getting Loopy
        desc: This lesson introduces the programming concept of loops (repeated instructions)
          through a dance activity. Students will learn simple choreography, then
          be instructed to repeat it.
      RelayProgramming:
        title: Relay programming
        desc: Students run a relay race, where they dash across the yard to write
          an algorithm based on a "Graph Paper Programming" image. They can only write
          one instruction at a time and if there's an error somewhere, they have to
          erase everything back to that point.
      Conditionals:
        title: Mga conditional
        desc: To learn about conditional statements, students play a card game and

        title: Functional Suncatchers
        desc: Students create an algorithm with variables and functions (pieces of
          code that you want to use over and over again) to create suncatchers using
          string and beads.
      SongwritingParameters:
        title: Songwriting with Parameters
        desc: Students use the concept of the chorus in a song to learn about passing

          an algorithm simple there are lots of ways to use it. If you want to make
          sure everyone ends up with the same thing, then your algorithm needs more
          detail.
      EnvelopeVariables:
        title: Envelope Variables
        desc: Variables allow for a lot of freedom in computer science.  This lesson
          helps to explain what variables are and how we can use them in many different
          ways. Use this activity before (or in conjunction with) the lesson on abstraction
          to really hit the idea home.
      MadGlibs:
        title: Mad Glibs
        desc: Abstraction is one of the most important skills for a computer scientist
          to understand.  This activity will have your students analyzing stories
          for differences so that they can abstract them away. Those abstracted stories
          become templates for fun and crazy new ones.
      ForLoopFun:
        title: For Loop Fun
        desc: We know that loops allow us to do things over and over again, but now
          we’re going to learn how to use loops with extra structure built right in.
      SongwritingWithParameters:
        title: Songwriting With Parameters
        desc: 'One of the most magnificent structures in the computer science world
          is the function.  Functions (sometimes called procedures) are mini programs
          that you can use over and over inside of your bigger program. This lesson
          will help students intuitively understand why combining chunks of code into
          functions is such a helpful practice.  '
      BinaryImages:
        title: Binary Images
        desc: Though many people think of binary as strictly zeros and ones, our previous
          courses taught students that information can be represented in a variety
          of binary options.  This lesson takes that concept one step further as it
          illustrates how a computer can store even more complex information (such
          as images and colors) in binary, as well.
