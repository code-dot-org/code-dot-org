      Course 4 Artist Vars 13_authored_hint:
        Course_4_Artist_Vars_13_a: You need two repeat loops (one inside the other)
          both repeating `sides` times.
        Course_4_Artist_Vars_13_b: "The inner repeat loop draws an octagon (turning
          to the left).   \n\nAfterwards, you need to move forward and turn right
          only in the outer loop."
        Course_4_Artist_Vars_13_c: To adjust the shape to stay the same size when
          the number of sides change, use the math block to divide the length in pixels
          by the number of sides.
      Course 4 Artist Vars 6_authored_hint:
        Course_4_Artist_Vars_6_a: To draw a regular polygon, turn **360/sides** each
          time.
      Course 4 Artist Vars 8_authored_hint:
        Course_4_Artist_Vars_8_a: If you divide your starting length by the number
          of sides, the length of each side will get shorter as the number of sides
          gets higher.
      Course 4 Bee Params 7_authored_hint:
        notice_pattern: 'Do you see a pattern in how the number of nectar changes? '
        count_with_for: Notice that the nectar goes up in steps. What kind of block
          can you use to do the same thing many times while counting up?
      Course 4 Bee Params 8_authored_hint:
        Course_4_Bee_Params_8_a: It's okay to ask for a honey number and a nectar
          number each time.  If there's none of something, the number can be 0.
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 2_authored_hint:
        Course_4_Play_Lab_Params_2_a: You will need to click "edit" on the jump function
          and update it so that it uses the `height` parameter.
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 2_authored_hint:
        Course_4_Play_Lab_Vars_2_a: Make sure to set the number for `dog_speed` to
          something larger than `cat_speed`.
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 2_authored_hint:
        Course_4_Play_Labs_For_Loops_2_a: What would you add to your `for` loop every
          time to skip the even numbers?
      Course 4 Playlab For Loop Freeplay_authored_hint: []
      Course 4 Playlab For Loops 4b_authored_hint:
        Course_4_Playlab_For_Loops_4b_a: The flags are about 330 pixels away from
          the characters.
        Course_4_Playlab_For_Loops_4b_b: How can you make each character reach 330
          pixels in the same number of moves with different starting and stopping
          numbers?
        Course_4_Playlab_For_Loops_4b_c: Remember, it doesn't matter how much a character
          passes the flag by on its last step, as long as it takes each character
          the same number of steps to get to the flag.
      Course 4 Playlab For Loops 5b_authored_hint:
        Course_4_Playlab_For_Loops_5b_a: The characters are about 175 pixels away
          from the center.
        Course_4_Playlab_For_Loops_5b_b: Remember, a character's next step will be
          longer than their last, since the counter keeps getting larger.
      Course 4 Playlab For Loops 6b_authored_hint: []
      Course 4 SCF 1_authored_hint:
        Course_4_SCF_1_a: Each hexagon has 40 pixel sides.
        Course_4_SCF_1_b: There is a 120 pixel jump between each hexagon in each horizontal
          line.
        Course_4_SCF_1_c: "Before you draw the second row of hexagons, you need to
          turn right by 60 degrees and jump forward 40 pixels.  \n\nOnce you're in
          the correct vertical location, you have to turn your artist back again and
          jump backward 320 pixels."
        Course_4_SCF_1_d: "Before you draw the third row of hexagons, you need to
          turn right by 60 degrees and jump forward 40 pixels.  \n\nOnce you're in
          the correct vertical location, you have to turn your artist back again and
          jump backward 440 pixels (120 pixels farther than your `shift down/forward`
          function. "

          of this `for` loop where you stop to interact with objects.
        Course_4_SCFL_2_c: During each iteration of the `for` loop, the number for
          each object relates to the `counter` variable in some way.

        Course_4_SCFL_7_a: The color change happens using the `set color with red,
          green, blue` block.  Red is set to `counter`. Green is  `255 - counter`,
          and blue is set constant at 255.
        Course_4_SCFL_7_b: 'This drawing is made using two similar `for loops`.  One
          goes from 5 to 200 by 2, the other goes from 200 to 5 by 2. '
        Course_4_SCFL_7_c: Inside each `for loop` you move forward 5 pixels before
          you turn by `360 / counter`. Don't forget to set your brush to width `counter`
          before you do!
        Course_4_SCFL_7_d: You'll need to turn left by 225 degrees between the two
          `for loops`.

        Course_4_SCV_1_a: 'Variables are helpful because you can add to them each
          time through a loop. '
        Course_4_SCV_1_b: This puzzle has one loop that creates the polygon, one loop
          that repeats the polygon `sides` times, then another loop that does it all
          again after adding 5 to `sides`.
        Course_4_SCV_1_c: Using a variable for `sides` and one for `length` makes
          the code cleaner because you can loop the same code multiple times, instead
          of creating a new copy for each set of numbers.

          Take a look at what a single completed shape looks like

        Course_4_SCV_6_b: 'You will benefit from creating 8 variables: red1, green1,
          blue1, red2, green2, blue2, length, and sides.'
        Course_4_SCV_6_c: Each of the shape's 5 sides is broken up into pieces of
          `length`/`sides` where the zig is teal (rgb = 0,175,200) and the zag is
          purple (rgb = 100, 50, 150).
        Course_4_SCV_6_d: 'To zig, turn left by `360`/`sides`.  To zag, turn right
          by `360`/`sides`. '
        Course_4_SCV_6_e: 'The rest of the program is very standard for making a full
          360 degree rotation from a shape, except that we are overlapping the shapes
          by half, so we have to turn right by `180`/`sides`, which means that we
          need twice as many of them as usual (`sides`*`2` repetitions). '

        brush_width: We set the brush width to 1, then the color to blue before we
          did anything else.
        double_loop: Try putting a `for loop` inside of a `repeat` loop.
        specifics: "The `for loop` runs from three to seventeen for each of the six
          \"petals\" before moving on to create the next, drawing shapes with only
          an odd number of sides.\n        \nThe `set alpha` block uses division to
          fade the color as the counter gets higher."
        after: When you're done with each "petal", be sure to `move forward` 20 pixels
          before you make a 60 degree rotation.

        brush_width: We set the brush width to 1, then the color to blue before we
          did anything else.
        double_loop: Try putting a `for loop` inside of a `repeat` loop.
        specifics: "The `for loop` runs from three to seventeen for each of the six
          \"petals\" before moving on to create the next, drawing shapes with only
          an odd number of sides.\n        \nThe `set alpha` block uses division to
          fade the color as the counter gets higher."
        after: When you're done with each "petal", be sure to `move forward` 20 pixels
          before you make a 60 degree rotation.

        courseF_bee_for5_b: Use the `counter` variable in each loop so the bee moves
          different distances between each flower.
        courseF_bee_for5_c: Don't be afraid to make a mistake! Try adding blocks and
          running the code to see what will happen, even if you haven't solved the
          puzzle yet.
      courseF_bee_for6_authored_hint:
        courseF_bee_for6_a: Don't forget to use a `counter` variable inside your `repeat`
          loop.
        courseF_bee_for6_b: Within your `for` loop, you will want to have a `move
          forward` command, and a loop to collect nectar.
        courseF_bee_for6_c: Your loop should count **from 5 to 1**.

          your counter variable each time through. \n\nWhat do you need to add to
          each number to get the next amount of nectar?"
        courseF_bee_for8_b: In this puzzle, you will need to move in a stair step
          pattern to get to the flowers.
        courseF_bee_for8_c: Your loop will count *from 3 to 15* with some increment.

          What do you have to do to the counter at each flower to equal the amount of nectar you need to collect?
        courseF_bee_for9_c: It looks like you will need to turn the bee at the beginning
          of each loop iteration if you want to solve the puzzle.

          code at the end of your program outside of your loop.
        2-3_Bee_Loops_4A_c: If you can't spot the loops yet, try coding it out the
          long way first, then see what you can combine into a `repeat` loop at the
          end.

          The bee is looping these actions over and over again:
          - move forward
          - make honey
          - turn left
          - move forward
          - turn right
      sample6_authored_hint:
        sample6_a: Did you know that you can use more than one repeat loop in a puzzle?
        sample6_b: Sometimes repeat loops have lots of blocks inside, and sometimes
          they might only have one!
