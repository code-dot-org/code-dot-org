        The bee only wants nectar right
        now. Not all objects are flowers, so check underneath EVERY CLOUD to see if
        it is hiding a flower. If it is, then you can gather nectar.
      4-5 Bee Conditionals 1 (copy 1)_instruction: |
        The bee can't tell if this is
        a flower or a honeycomb. Gather nectar only from flowers, but first check
        if it is a flower or a honeycomb.
      4-5 Bee Conditionals 1_instruction: Biet kan inte avgöra om detta är en blomma
        eller en bivaxkaka. Samla nektar endast från blommor men kolla först om det
        är en blomma eller en bivaxkaka.
      4-5 Bee Conditionals 2 (copy 1)_instruction: |

        variables you like, and then click finish to move on.
      Big Game Animation 2 (copy 1)_instruction: |
        The function 'update-target'
        function takes the target's current x value, and returns an updated value.
        Complete the 'update-target' function so that it adds to the x value each
        time it is called. The more you add to x, the faster the target will go.
      Big Game Animation 2_instruction: |
        The update-target function takes the target's
        current x value, and returns an updated value. Complete the update-target
        function so that it adds to the x value each time it is called. The more you
        add to x, the faster the target will go.
      Big Game Animation 3_instruction: |
        The update-danger function should work just
        like update-target, except that the danger should move from the right side
        over towards the left. Complete update-danger to make the danger fly across
        the screen.
      Big Game Animation 4_instruction: |
        At this point in your game, your danger
        should run across the screen from right to left, and your target should run
        across from left to right. They don't ever come back on screen once they've
        left, but we'll take care of that later. Take a minute to make sure your
        game is working like you want it to, and then click "Finish" to move on.
      Big Game Booleans 1_instruction: |
        When you last worked on your game we got
        our target and danger sprites to fly across the screen, but they never come
        back. Click "Run" to see how your game is currently working, and then click
        finish and we'll work on making those sprites reappear on screen after they've
        left.
      Big Game Booleans 2_instruction: |
        Go to the Functions section of the toolbox
        and complete the safe-left? function so that it returns true if the sprite's
        x coordinate is greater than -50. If you're successful you should see the
        Danger go off the left side and then return on the right side.
      Big Game Booleans 3_instruction: |
        Now that you've got safe-left?, let's fill
        in safe-right? - it should take in a sprite's x coordinate and return true
        if that coordinate is less than 450. Once your safe-right? is complete you
        should see the Target go off the right side of the screen and return on the
        left.
      Big Game Booleans 4_instruction: |
        Complete the onscreen? function so that it
        checks whether both safe-left? and safe-right? are true.
      Big Game Booleans 5_instruction: |
        At this point your Danger should run across
        the screen from right to left, your Target should run across from left to
        right, and they should both return to the opposite side, repeatedly. Take
        a minute to make sure your game is working like you want it to, and then click
        "Finish" to move on.
      Big Game Collision 1 (copy 1)_instruction: |

        finish and we'll work on making those sprites reappear on screen after they've
        left.
      Big Game Collision 1_instruction: |
        At this point you've programmed a video
        game with a moving Target and Danger, both of which return to the screen once
        they've left, and a Player that responds to keyboard input. Click "Run"
        to see how your game is currently working, and then we'll dig into the final
        missing piece - collision detection!
      Big Game Collision 2_instruction: |
        To move the player up and down, we'll need
        to use a conditional block to figure out which key is pressed and respond
        accordingly. Computers read keypresses as numeric key codes - the up arrow
        is 38 and the down arrow is 40. You can lookup other key codes in your student
        workbook. Edit the 'update-player' function so that if moves the player
        up when the up arrow is pressed, or down when the down arrow is pressed.
      Big Game Collision 3_instruction: |
        Use the Distance Formula, so the distance
        function returns the distance between the player's center coordinates (px,
        py) and another sprite's center coordinates (cx, cy).
      Big Game Collision 4_instruction: |
        Complete the collide? function so that it
        returns true if the distance between two points is less than 100 pixels apart.

        figure out the turns for a shape of "sides". Can you recreate this picture?
        Here's a tip each shape is 100 pixel's in length.
      Course 4 Artist Params 12_instruction: |
        Use your "pinwheel" function to draw

      Course 4 Artist Params 2_instruction: |
        That triangle function would be a whole
        lot more useful if it could draw triangles of different sizes. I've added
        a parameter for line length, but it doesn't do anything yet. Can you update
        the function so it uses the "length" parameter when it draws each side?
        The triangle sizes are 150 pixels, 75 pixels and 25 pixels.
      Course 4 Artist Params 3_instruction: "Awesome, can you draw each of these\ntriangles
        with that new function? The first is 25 pixels long, the second\nis 50, and
        the third is 75. \n"
      Course 4 Artist Params 4_instruction: |
        Can you add a new function called square?
        It should also take a length parameter, just like the triangle. This time
        draw 3 squares 25, 50 and 75 pixels in length,100 pixels apart.
      Course 4 Artist Params 5_instruction: |
        Use both of your new functions to draw
        this picture. To make this easier you use a loop with a "counter" parameter.
      Course 4 Artist Params 6_instruction: "Let's edit this \"draw a shape\" function.\nIt

        Can you figure out how to draw this
        shape? Here's a hint create a new function with 6 sides called a hexagon.
      Course 4 Artist Params 9_instruction: |
        Do you remember when we used the counter
        loop but removed a loop within? Let's have some fun and use the "draw a
        shape" function with "sides" and "length" parameters. Can you re create
        these shapes? The square counter should be 5/100/5, the triangle counter should
        be 10/100/10 and the hexagon is 2/100/2.
      Course 4 Artist Var 9_instruction: |
        Here's the algorithm to draw a triangle,
        modify it so it uses the "sides" variable instead. Replace the number 3

      Course 4 Artist Vars 1_instruction: |
        Can you help me draw an equilateral triangle?
        It has to be exactly 100 pixels long on each side.
      Course 4 Artist Vars 10_instruction: |
        Here's an algorithm that draws a triangle
        out of smaller triangles. Can you modify it so that it uses the "sides"
        variable to draw each triangle? Look through the code, and every time you
        see the number 3, replace it with your "sides" variable. Remember to use
        the "set sides" block.
      Course 4 Artist Vars 11_instruction: |
        Here’s more complicated code using the
        same concepts from the last puzzle - what should you set the "sides" variable
        to in order to draw this picture made of squares?
      Course 4 Artist Vars 12_instruction: |
        Let's set the "sides" variable to
        5. The more sides we add to this algorithm, the bigger this whole pattern
        gets! Notice that there is another variable called "length". We can now
        use that wherever we have a "move forward." Set the "length" variable
        to 75 for this shape.
      Course 4 Artist Vars 13_instruction: "When a shape has lots of sides, each\nside
        needs to be shorter if you want the whole pattern to fit on the screen.\n\r\nLet's
        recreate the algorithm for this amazing pattern, but instead of\nmanually
        setting the \"length\" variable, let's use a math block with the\n\"sides\"

      Course 4 Artist Vars 2_instruction: |
        Instead of using "move forward by 150,"
        the "move" block is now referencing a variable called "length." Can you
        set "length" to 150 to draw this new triangle?
      Course 4 Artist Vars 3_instruction: "Here's a loop that draws a square, but\nsomething's
        missing. Can you fix it so that it uses the variable \"length\"\nto figure

      Course 4 Artist Vars 4_instruction: |
        Now I want to make a rectangle that is
        twice as tall as it is wide. We've got a variable called "width" that needs
        to be set to 100. Can you use the math blocks to complete the code?
      Course 4 Artist Vars 5_instruction: |
        Use the variable "sides" to control
        how many times this loop gets run.

      Course 4 Artist Vars 8_instruction: |
        Free Play: Experiment with the number
        of sides this shape has. Can you change the algorithm so that the overall
        size of the shape stays the same, no matter how many sides it has? Hint: You
        might have to use your math blocks (360 divided by "sides") in two places
        this time.
      Course 4 Artist Vars 9_instruction: |
        Modify this algorithm so it uses the "sides"
        variable instead of a fixed number to draw a triangle. Don't forget to use
        the "set sides to" block.
      Course 4 Bee 1_instruction: "The bee can't tell what's under the cloud! First,\nuse
        the \"if\" block to check whether it is a flower or a honeycomb. Then\nonly

      Course 4 Bee 2_instruction: |
        Use the "if/else" block to check each object
        to see if it's a flower or a honeycomb . If it's a flower, collect nectar...otherwise,
        make honey!
      Course 4 Bee 3_instruction: |
        The unknown object is either a flower or a honeycomb.
        This time, use the if/else block to collect nectar if it is a flower, else
        make honey (because then it would be a honeycomb).
      Course 4 Bee 4_instruction: |
        This purple flower may have either 3, 2, or 1
        nectar. Here an if/else block is combined with another if/else block to create

        amount of nectar.
      Course 4 Bee 5_instruction: |
        This purple flower may have either 3, 2, or 1
        nectar. Add an if-else block to create an if, else-if, else block. Complete
        the solution to collect the unknown amount of nectar.
      Course 4 Bee 6_instruction: |
        This purple flower may have either 3, 2, or 1
        nectar. Create an if, else-if, else block to collect the unknown amount of
        nectar.
      Course 4 Bee 7_instruction: |
        Use everything you have learned so far to collect
        all the nectar. The purple flower may have either 3, 2, or 1 nectar.
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 1_instruction: |
        Use a loop to collect the nectar from
        each flower.
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 10_instruction: |
        If your loop is counting down, the
        increment is subtracted from your counter variable each loop. What should
        your increment be to collect 9, then 6, and then 3 nectar?
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 11_instruction: |
        What's wrong with this loop? See if
        you can fix it and make the bee collect all the nectar.
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 2_instruction: |
        Here's a new kind of loop, called the
        "for" loop. This particular for loop will count from 1 to 5 by 1, and run
        the contents of the loop each time it counts. Help the Bee get the nectar.
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 3_instruction: |
        You can solve this puzzle by using a
        for loop to count from 1 to 3 by 1. Now let's go get some nectar!
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 4_instruction: |
        Collect all of the nectar from these
        flowers. I wonder if there's an easier way to do this...

      Course 4 Bee For Loops 6_instruction: |
        You can also use a for loop to count
        down. Try gathering this nectar by counting down from 5 to 1 by 1.
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 7_instruction: |
        Use your for loop "counter" variable
        to control how far to move horizontally.
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 8_instruction: |
        Can you use the loop variable to control
        movement and nectar collection?
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 9_instruction: |
        The last number in your for loop is
        called the "increment,"  and each time the loop is run the counter variable
        changes by the increment. Try collecting these flowers using an increment
        of 2.
      Course 4 Bee Loops 5 NEW_instruction: |
        Here are three flowers. Can you find
        the pattern of instructions that you need to repeat 3 times to collect the
        nectar with the fewest number of blocks?
      Course 4 Bee Loops 5a NEW_instruction: |
        Now, use loops to help the bee collect
        all the nectar on it's way to the honeycomb with as few blocks as possible.  When
        you get there, don't forget to make honey!
      Course 4 Bee Params 1_instruction: |
        Use the function "get 3 nectar" which
        turns, moves to collect the nectar, and then returns to the original location.
        Write a sequence to collect all of the nectar using "get 3 nectar."
      Course 4 Bee Params 2_instruction: |
        Modify the "get 3 nectar" function so
        it makes me turn right instead of left to the flowers.
      Course 4 Bee Params 3 (copy 1)_instruction: |
        Now there are flowers on both
        sides! Maybe you can use a parameter so that the same function works for flowers
        on either side. I've added a parameter called "direction" to the function.
        If the "direction" parameter equals 0 I should turn left, if it's 1 I should
        turn right.
      Course 4 Bee Params 3_instruction: "Now there are flowers on both sides! We've\nadded
        variables called \"left\" and \"right\" for you to use, and added a\nparameter
        called \"direction\" to \"get 3 nectar\". Edit \"get 3 nectar\"\nso that the
        bee turns the correct direction when the variables \"left\" or\n\"right\"
        are passed into the function.  \n"

        This time, let's try counting
        the odd numbers from 1 to 100.
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 1_instruction: |
        Here's a function called "jump"
        that causes your main character to jump up 100 pixels. Use the jump function
        to collect all of the flags.
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 10_instruction: "We've added one last function for\nyou.
        \r\n\r\nUse an \"if\" statement to program your game to call the \"level_up\"\nfunction
        only when \"player_score\" becomes greater than a certain number.\r\n\r\nFor\nexample:
        \"player_score\" > 6\r\n\r\nPlay the game, and make it past level\n4 to move
        to the next puzzle. "
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 2_instruction: "Now we've got flags that are too\nhigh
        for our current jump! Let's use both the \"up\" and \"down\" arrows\nso that
        we can have multiple jump heights.  \r\n\r\nWe need to add a parameter\nto
        our jump function called \"height\".  The up arrow should cause the dog\nto
        jump 200 pixels and the down arrow should make it jump only 100 pixels.\n\r\n\r\nHint:
        You will need to click \"edit\" on the jump function and update\nit so that
        it uses the \"height\" parameter."
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 3_instruction: "We have added another parameter to\nthe
        jump function so that we can use it with other actors. Each actor is represented\nby
        a number, starting from one. Edit the \"jump\" function so that it uses\nthe
        \"actor\" parameter to make the correct character jump. \n"
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 4_instruction: |
        Here's a function called "patrol."
        Edit it to move Cat up 400 pixels and then down 400 pixels.
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 5_instruction: |
        Edit the the "patrol" function to
        add an "actor" parameter, so that we can call it for each of the actors
        on the screen. Remember, the actors correspond to numbers 1, 2, and 3.
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 6_instruction: |
        Add another parameter called "speed"
        to the "patrol" function. Use a "set speed" block with the new "speed"
        parameter.

      Course 4 Play Lab Params 8_instruction: |
        Use a "when actor touches" block
        to send Dog back to the top-left ONLY if Dog touches any of the other actors.
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 9_instruction: "Here's our game from earlier but\nmost

      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 1_instruction: |
        This time you don't have to write any
        code, just hit "Run" to play the game! In this game, you're the dog who
        is trying to collect more flags than the cat. Use the down arrow to control
        the dog. Press "Finish" when you're done playing.
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 2_instruction: |
        The race in that last puzzle wasn't
        very fair! Change the "dog_speed" variable to make sure you can collect
        more flags than Cat. The first to collect 10 flags wins!
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 3_instruction: |
        Here's a new kind of game! Use the
        left and right arrows to move, and the up arrow to jump. See if you can collect
        all of the flags.
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 4_instruction: |
        Now we're using a variable called "height"
        to control how high the dog can jump. Update the "height" variable so that
        the dog can jump high enough to reach all the flags.
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 5_instruction: "Let's build a game! First we'll need\na
        score. Rebuild the code that you saw in the last level to set the score\nto

      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 6 (copy 1)_instruction: |
        Cool, now we've got our score
        variable, but how are we going to make it useful? How about adding to your
        score variable each time you hit the enemy with a fireball? Use the "when
        actor 2 touches anything" event to trigger an update to your score when your
        fireballs hit the cat. You can increment the score by setting score = score
        + 1. Get your score up to 10 (going one at a time!) to pass the level.
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 6_instruction: "Use the right arrow to shoot hearts.\r\n\r\nIn\nour
        game, how should we score points? Add 1 to your \"points\" variable each\ntime
        Dog hits Cat with a heart. Use the \"when actor 2 touches anything\"\nevent

        \"points = points + 1.\" Get your score up to 10 (going one at\na time!) to
        pass the level."
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 7_instruction: |
        Nice, now let's make sure this game
        isn't too easy to play. Any time Dog (actor 1) gets hit by yellow hearts
        from Cat (actor 2), you should lose a point. Start with 10 points so it's
        not too hard. Let your score drop down from 10 to 0 to pass the level.
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 8 (copy 1)_instruction: |
        Alright, one last thing for
        this game - let's set it up so the player can win (or lose). Use a forever

        we count even higher in the same amount of time. Try making the dog count
        from 10 up to 1000, 10 at a time.
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 4_instruction: |
        Changing the increment can be
        helpful, but we're still counting linearly (each number is the same distance
        from the last) What if I wanted to count exponentially? Without changing the
        settings in this for loop, can you count 1, 4, 9 , 16, 25... (counter squared)?

        to write the function definition (you will see two examples provided).
      Eval Design Recipe 1 (copy 1)_instruction: |
        We're going to write a function
        that draws a solid rectangle of any color that is twice wide as it is high.
        Start with an example - draw a solid green rectangle that has a height on
        100 pixels.
      Eval Design Recipe 1_instruction: |
        Alright, now given the Contract wide-rect:
        Number String -> Image, write an example - draw a solid green rectangle that
        has a height of 100 pixels.
      Eval Design Recipe 2 (copy 1)_instruction: |
        Let's do one more example before
        writing the function definition - this time draw a solid red rectangle with
        a height of 75 pixels.
      Eval Design Recipe 2_instruction: |
        Let's do one more example before writing
        the function definition - this time draw a solid red rectangle with a height
        of 75 pixels.
      Eval Design Recipe 3_instruction: |
        The Design Recipe for wide-rect already
        has a contract and one example. Can you write a second example and then complete
        the definition? The wide-rect function should produce a rectangle of given
        color that is twice as wide as it is high.
      Eval Design Recipe 4_instruction: |
        Use the Design Recipe to create a function
        starburst. When given a number of points and an outer radius, starburst returns
        a yellow radial star with given points, and an inner radius that is half the
        outer radius.
      Eval Design Recipe 5_instruction: |
        Using the Design Recipe, write a function
        striped-flag that takes two colors and produces a flag that is 250 pixels
        wide, 150 pixels tall, with three even horizontal stripes of given colors,
        in the order color2, color1, color2.
      Eval Design Recipe 6_instruction: |
        Write a function large-polygon that should
        output a solid polygon of given sides and color that takes up most of the
        window, regardless of the number of sides. To make sure that the polygon doesn't
        get too large as you increase the number of sides, side length should be inversely
        proportional to side number, with a length of (800/sides).

      Eval Strings Images .1_instruction: |
        So far we've only dealt with a single
        type of data, Numbers. Another type of data is a String, which is any combination
        of letters, numbers, or other characters wrapped in quotation marks. Run the
        String "Hello, world!" and see what happens.
      Eval Strings Images .2_instruction: |
        The string-append function takes two Strings
        and returns a single combined String. Add a String "Universe" to the second
        argument of string-append.
      Eval Strings Images 1_instruction: |
        The third type of data we're going to
        use is an Image. This star function takes in a Number and two Strings, and
        it evaluates to an Image. Use this function to make a solid red star with
        radius of 100.

        controls its color - try some different colors to see what works.
      Eval Strings Images 3_instruction: |
        Some functions can only take a specific
        set of Strings, such as the second argument of this circle function, which
        controls its style. Draw this orange outline circle using the special String
        block with a dropdown to make sure you only use valid styles.
      Eval Strings Images 4_instruction: |
        Try using the rectangle block to draw this
        solid, red rectangle - it is 175 pixels wide and 100 pixels tall.
      Eval Strings Images 5_instruction: |
        Try using this new Evaluation Block called
        overlay to place a 100 pixel white triangle on top of a 200 pixel red circle.
      Eval Strings Images 6_instruction: |
        Use the overlay block to place a 75 pixel
        radius yellow star on top of a 150 pixel long blue square.
      Eval Strings Images 7_instruction: |
        The offset block lets you move an image
        relative to where it would normally be placed. Use this block to offset the
        square by 100 pixels on the y-axis.
      Eval Strings Images 8_instruction: |
        Here's a different kind of star block
        - it's called radial-star and it allows you to draw stars with any number

      PDAlg Updates Cond_instruction: |
        When you went to PD in the summer, the Conditional
        block that you were introduced to was black and allowed any data type to be
        used. This proved to be confusing, given that every other function we've
        seen always produces the same type of data. To help make conditionals clearer
        and more consistent we've replaced the single black block with a separate
        block for each data type.
      PDAlg Updates Errors_instruction: |
        Run the provided program and use the error
        messages to try and track down the bugs.
      PDAlg Updates Space_instruction: |
        Making use of limited programming space (especially
        on small screens) is challenging with a block based language. To help with
        this we've added a few features. Experiment with this provided code to see
        how the space can be manipulated to deal with larger programs.
      PDK5 Conditionals 1_instruction: |

        whatever size you want.  Happy pixeling!
      Pixelation - Lesson 15 - Color Free Play_instruction: |
        Requirements: The icon
        must be 16x16 pixels. You must use the Pixelation Widget to encode the bits
        of color information. The image must be encoded with at least 12 bits per
        pixel.
      Pixelation - Lesson 15 - Color Shades 4x4_instruction: |
        We start you out with
        the 4x4 image Maddie created in the video. Your task is to fill a 4x4 grid
        with colors using 12-bits per pixel. Here are the requirements: Row 1 - fill
        with shades of red. Row 2 - shades of green. Row 3 - shades of blue. Row 4
        - shades of gray.
      Pixelation - Lesson 15 - Color Shades_instruction: |
        We start you out with the
        row of shades of red that Maddie created in the video. Experiment with 6-bit
        color by filling in the bottom row of the image with shades of a different
        color. Here is an example with some shades of blue. Try your own color!

        Something happened to the bits in this image!  Find
        error and fix it!
      Pixelation 4x4 Empty_instruction: |
        The width and height are now encoded in
        the pixel data. Can you figure out how to adjust the dimensions?
      Pixelation Bee_instruction: |
        This larger image of a bee encodes color with
        12 bits per pixel, but viewing in hex makes it easier to see the color of
        each pixel. If you switch to binary mode - hold on to your hat - it's a lot
        of bits. Here's another mind-blowing thing to try: slide the bits per pixel
        up to 24 bits per pixel. What happens? Can you explain this behavior?
      Pixelation Flappy_instruction: |
        Here is a bigger image at 9 bits per pixel.
        With 9 bits per pixel you can express 512 different colors. Click through
        to see the next image which is even more sophisticated, but easier to understand.

        A rocket blasts off, traveling at 15 meters
        per second. Using the Design Recipe, write a function called rocket-height
        that takes in a number of  seconds that have passed since the rocket took
        off, and produces the height of the rocket at that time.
      Play Lab Rocket 3_instruction: |
        Awesome, now can you update that function so
        that our rocket moves more quickly? Make sure to update the purpose statement,
        examples, and function definition to launch a rocket at 40 meters per second.
      Play Lab Rocket 4 (copy 1)_instruction: |

        function that describes a rocket that travels at "seconds" squared meters
        per second.
      Play Lab Rocket 4_instruction: |
        Real rockets start off slowly and gain speed
        over time - so let's add some simple acceleration to ours! Can you write
        a function that describes a rocket that is at 10 meters at 1 second, 40 meters
        at 2 seconds, 90 meters at 3 seconds, 160 at 4 seconds and so on?
      Play Lab Rocket 5_instruction: |
        Much better, but let's write one more function

      Sam the Butterfly 1 (copy 1)_instruction: |
        This butterfly is named Sam, and
        the game area is Sam’s yard. Sam's yard is 400 pixels wide by 400 pixels
        tall! As you can see, Sam is free to walk around the yard, and the coordinates
        at the top of the screen update to tell you his location. Use the arrow keys
        to move sam around his yard. Help Sam collect all of the flags to move on.
      Sam the Butterfly 1_instruction: |
        This bat is named Sam, and the game area
        is Sam’s yard. Sam's yard is 400 pixels wide by 400 pixels tall! As you can
        see, Sam is free to walk around the yard, and the coordinates at the top of
        the screen update to tell you his location. Click "Run" and then use the
        arrow keys to move Sam around his yard, making note of Sam's coordinates
        at different locations. Click "Finish" when you're ready to move on.
      Sam the Butterfly 2_instruction: |
        Sam's mom wants to make sure that she can
        always see at least a bit of him, so lets write some functions that help make
        sure he doesn't go too far out of the yard. Here's a function called safe-left?
        - it should take a Number for its domain that represents Sam's x-coordinates
        and return true if he's completely visible on screen. If your function works,
        Sam shouldn't be able to leave the yard from the left side.
      Sam the Butterfly 3_instruction: |
        In the last puzzle we kept Sam from leaving
        on the left, now let's do the same thing on the right. Complete the safe-right?
        function to make sure Sam can't go off the right side of the screen.
      Sam the Butterfly 4_instruction: |
        Huh, we can keep Sam from leaving on the
        left, or we can keep him from leaving on the right, but how can we keep him
        safe from leaving both directions? Try using the and block to program the
        function on-screen? to check if Sam is safe-left? and safe-right?
      Sam the Butterfly 5_instruction: |
        Free Play: Awesome, we've kept Sam safe
        on the left and right! Use this free play stage to experiment with your functions
        and further improve onscreen?
      Sam the Butterfly 6_instruction: |
        We've added a new parameter "y" to the
        "on-screen?" function. Update the function so that it checks that "safe-left?"
        AND "safe-right?" AND "safe-up?" are all true. When you've fixed the
        function, try going out of the yard from the left, right, and top sides.
      Sam the Butterfly 7_instruction: |
        Only one last direction to worry about! Create
        a "safe-down?" function and update the "on-screen?" function so that it
        checks up, down, left, and right.
      Sam the Butterfly Complete_instruction: |
        Only one last direction to worry about!

      Standalone_Artist_1_instruction: |
        Welcome to Artist! First off, let's try
        to make a simple square using the turn right block and move forward block.
        Each side should be 100 pixels long.
      Standalone_Artist_2_instruction: |
        Draw this diamond with 120 and 60 degree
        angles and 150 pixel long sides.

        sides and 60 degree turns?
      Standalone_Artist_4_instruction: |
        Now you've got a new block to play with,
        the loop. This will repeat a set of commands. What happens if you loop these
        commands 6 times?
      Standalone_Artist_5.5_instruction: |
        Notice how we simplified the diamond code
        by turning it into a loop. You can loop that whole sequence 12 times to draw
        the flower. Hint: You'll need to turn 30 degrees after your diamond loop
        so you don't keep drawing over the same diamond.
      Standalone_Artist_5_instruction: |
        How many times do you need to loop this diamond
        to draw the flower?
      Standalone_Artist_6_instruction: |
        Loop this hexagon code 6 times to create
        the design. How many degrees will you need to turn each time? Hint: divide
        the number of degrees in a circle by the number of times you are looping.
      Standalone_Artist_7_instruction: |
        A function is another programming tool to
        help you avoid repeating yourself. This function draws a flower, so you can
        use it any time you want to draw a flower. Use this and the new jump block
        to draw these flowers. Hint: The flowers are 150 pixels apart
      Standalone_Artist_8_instruction: |
        Here's a function called "Draw a shape"
        that we've programmed to draw hexagons. Run the code to see what it does
        and then experiment with the function to see what happens. Can you make it
        draw a pattern of squares, triangles, or octagons?
      Standalone_Artist_9_instruction: |
