        maze_2_2: 'Can you help me to catch the naughty pig? Stack a couple of "move
          forward" blocks together and press "Run" to help me get there. '
        maze_2_1: This pig is ruffling my feathers. Help me to find him!
        maze_2_2_5: Trace the path and lead me to the silly pig. Avoid TNT or the
          feathers will fly!
        maze_2_3: Guide me to the green evilness! (Watch out for TNT)
        maze_2_4: Keep calm and help me to find the bad pig. Otherwise I might get
          angry!
        maze_2_5: There's a way I can get to the silly pig using only 2 blocks. Can
          you figure it out?
        maze_2_6: Try to get me to the green intruder using only three blocks.
        maze_2_7: Help me banish this bad piggy using the fewest number of blocks.
          Try using more than one "repeat times" block.
        maze_2_8: 'When a block is grey, that means you can''t delete it. Solve this
          puzzle using the "repeat" block that repeats 3 times. Try putting these
          3 blocks inside the grey "repeat" block: move, move, turn.'
        maze_2_9: Ok, try the new "repeat until" block - it will repeat until I reach
          the annoying pig.
        maze_2_10: Ok, one last time for practice - can you solve this one using only
          4 blocks?
        maze_2_11: Dear person.  Me zombie. Me hungry. Must... get... to sunflower...
          Can you get me there with only 5 blocks?
        maze_2_12: Ok, this is similar, but slightly different. Can you do it in only
          5 blocks?
        maze_2_13: 'Use the new "if" block to let me decide when to turn. Hint: you
          only need one more block, but learn how we set it up so you can do it on
          your own next time.'
        maze_2_14: Ok, this is just like the last puzzle, but you need to remember
          how you used the "if" block and the "repeat" block together.
        maze_2_15: Me want sunflower! Use an "if" block to get me there with the fewest
          number of blocks.
        maze_2_16: Ok, let's do that again for practice - this isn't very different,
          but watch out for the chompers!
        maze_2_17: The "If-else" blocks checks a condition, and then does one thing
          OR another. To get me to the sunflower try to use this new block.
        maze_2_18: One more practice of the "if-else" block, can you get it right
          on your first try?
        maze_2_19: Can you add just 3 blocks to help me solve a more complex maze?
          If you do it right, I can walk any curvy path no matter the length.
        turtle_1_1: Hi, I'm an artist. You can write code to make me draw almost anything.
          Use a few blocks to make me draw over the grey lines in the picture.
        turtle_1_2: 'Now, draw a square. NOTE: use your favorite color by picking
          it in the new "set color" block.'
        turtle_1_3: Make a square using only 3 blocks.
        turtle_1_4: 'Draw a triangle whose sides are all in different colors, using
          the "random color" option that picks a different color each time. Hint:
          you''ll have to figure out how far to turn by clicking on the number in
          the turn block.'
        turtle_1_5: Now, for practice, draw a triangle and then a square to draw an
          envelope.
        turtle_1_6: 'Can you figure out how draw this triangle and square? Hint: Do
          the triangle first, then figure out how much to turn before drawing the
          square.'
        turtle_1_7: Ok, let's make it a bit harder - see if you can draw these green
          glasses. The squares are 100 pixels on each side, and they're 50 pixels
          apart. Don't forget to draw in green!
        turtle_1_8: Ok, try to figure out what happens if you run this code (or press
          "Run" to try it). Then, repeat it enough times to complete the drawing.
          The colors will be different every time.
        turtle_1_9: Can you figure out what number to replace the question marks with
          to draw a circle?
        turtle_1_10: 'You made it! Now, draw anything you want. Some fun ideas: a
          stick figure, snowflake, or spiral. Also try the new "set width" block.
          Have fun!'
        turtle_4_1: 'Can you draw a triangle (with edges of 100 pixels) with only
          3 blocks? Hint: use a "repeat" block.'
        turtle_4_2: Add a "turn right by 90 degrees" block somewhere in the middle
          of the program already out on the workspace to draw these triangles.
        turtle_4_3: Ok, here's the code you wrote to draw a single triangle. Can you
          add a "repeat" and "turn" block to make a pretty flower?
        turtle_4_4: 'Here''s the same code from the previous puzzle, but turning only
          36 degrees after drawing each triangle. How many times does this need to
          repeat? (Hint: after 360 degrees of turning the drawing will come full circle)'
        turtle_4_5: 'Here''s the same code from the previous puzzle, but repeating
          the turns 36 times. How many degrees should the turns be? (Hint: after 360
          degrees of turning the drawing will come full circle)'
        turtle_4_6: Using only 3 blocks, can you draw a square with edges of 20 pixels?
        turtle_4_7: 'Here''s the code for drawing the square from last puzzle. Can
          you repeat it to draw 10 adjacent squares like a ladder? Hint: you only
          need 2 more blocks.'
        turtle_4_8: Here's the solution to the previous puzzle. Can you add just 2
          more blocks to complete the drawing?
        turtle_4_9: Here's the solution to the previous puzzle. How many degrees should
          you turn to complete the drawing? (You probably need to guess a few times)
        turtle_4_10: Here's the solution to the previous puzzle. How many times should
          you repeat to complete the drawing?
        turtle_4_11: Try changing the numbers in the "turn" and "repeat" blocks to
          make different patterns. Or, experiment changing the rest of the code to
          draw anything you want.
        maze_karel_1_1: Hi, I'm a farmer. I need your help to flatten the field on
          my farm so it's ready for planting. Move me to the pile of dirt and use
          the "remove" block to remove it.
        maze_karel_1_2: Next, move me to the hole and fill it with TWO shovelfuls
          of dirt, using the "fill" block.
        maze_karel_1_3: Move me to the pile of dirt and tell me how many shovelfuls
          to remove using as few blocks as possible.
        maze_karel_1_4: 'Can you help me remove all four piles of dirt? Hint: use
          a repeat block if you can.'
        maze_karel_1_5: 'Help me fill in all these holes with 5 shovelfuls of dirt.
          Hint: you can put a "repeat" block inside the "while" block.'
        maze_karel_1_6: Remove all the piles of dirt, using as few blocks as possible.
          The new options in the dropdown menu on the "while" block tell me if I'm
          standing on a pile or a hole.
        maze_karel_1_7: Wow, I found a really deep hole! I don't know how many shovelfuls
          of dirt it needs. Can you write a program that fills it until the ground
          is even?
        maze_karel_1_8: Help me fill in the hole at the end of the field, using as
          few blocks as possible.
        maze_karel_1_9: 'Make me remove all these piles of dirt. Try to use as few
          blocks as possible. Hint: try using a "while" block.'
        maze_karel_1_10: I'm working late, so it's dark out, and I can't tell how
          large the piles are. Now I don't have all the options I used to have on
          the while block. Move me along the field, and if there is a pile, remove
          it.
        maze_karel_1_11: 'It''s still dark outside. Move me along the field. If there
          is a pile, remove it, and if there is a hole, fill it in. Hint: use the
          dropdown menu of options on the "if" block.'
        turtle_2_1: 'Hello. Me zombie artist. Me love drawing! Help me draw a square
          in a special color. Important note: you have all the same blocks but they''ve
          now been arranged in categories.'
        turtle_2_2: Welcome to using functions, which let you define new blocks! Try
          the new "draw a square" block, found in the "Functions" category, to draw
          a small 50x50 green square.
        turtle_2_3: Use the "repeat" block (in the "Loops" category) to draw 3 squares
          of size 100, each 120 degrees apart. And do it in 3 different, random colors.
        turtle_2_4: 'Now we''re going to get fancy. Change the code to draw 36 squares,
          100 pixels wide, and each 10 degrees apart. Hint: you may want to use the
          slider to make me go faster.'
        turtle_2_5: Draw squares with sides of 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90 pixels.  You'll
          need to use the "draw a square" function five times.
        turtle_2_6: 'Ok, this program will use a counter, to draw the same squares
          as last time. You want the square to be the same size as the counter, so
          use the "counter" block. Hint: It''s in the Variables category.'
        turtle_2_7: Here's a program to draw a spiral, but the blocks are disabled
          so they won't run. Make a new program using a "for" block (in the Loops
          category) and "counter" block (in the Variables category) to draw the same
          spiral.
        turtle_2_7_5: There's a new "draw a snowman" function (in the Functions category).
          Draw two snowmen, of height 250 and 100.
        turtle_2_8: This one's a bit tricky. Use the "draw a snowman" function and
          the new "jump forward" block (in the Actions category). Draw 3 snowmen in
          different colors, 100 pixels apart.
        turtle_2_9: Use a "for" loop to draw a family of snowmen with heights of 110,
          100, 90, 80, and 70. The snowmen should all be 60 pixels apart.
        turtle_2_10: Here's some code to try experimenting with different spirals.  What
          happens if you change the turn amount? Or set a random color in the loop?  Draw
          anything you like.
        maze_karel_2_1: 'Try using the blocks to help me remove all the piles and
          fill in all the holes on the ground. Try to use loops instead of using too
          many blocks. Hint: you can put a loop inside another loop.'
        maze_karel_2_2: We've defined our own block called "fill 5", which is now
          in the Functions category. Use it to help me fill in this hole.
        maze_karel_2_3: Use the new "fill 5" function block to make me fill in all
          the holes. You'll have to drag out the "fill 5" block out from the Functions
          category.
        maze_karel_2_4: Define a new function that removes 7 shovelfuls. Then use
          it to write a program that helps me remove all the piles.
        maze_karel_2_5: Create a new function that removes 6 shovelfuls from a pile,
          and use it to help me level out all the piles.
        maze_karel_2_6: Use two new functions, "fill 8" and "remove 8", to help me
          level out the pile and fill in the hole.
        maze_karel_2_7: There's a cow in my field! Write a new function that helps
          me avoid the cow and remove the pile. Put all your blocks inside the new
          function.
        maze_karel_2_8: Use this new function, "avoid the cow and remove 1", to help
          me remove all the piles.
        maze_karel_2_9: Ok, here's a function that removes 4 different piles of dirt
          in a vertical column. Try putting this function inside a loop, so that you
          remove all the piles of dirt using only a few new blocks.
        maze_karel_2_10: Move me across the field, and use these two functions to
          help me remove all the piles and fill all the holes.
        turtle_3_1: This puzzle shows you how the "draw a square" and "draw a circle"
          functions are defined.  Defining a function doesn't run its blocks.  You
          have to pull out the "draw a square" block to actually draw a square.
        turtle_3_2: Using the "draw a square" function as an example, create a "draw
          a triangle" function and use it.
        turtle_3_3: 'Draw triangular fences around the cats and a square fence around
          the cow.  Tip: test the program as you go along.'
        turtle_3_4: See if you can figure out how to use "draw a square" and "draw
          a triangle" (and some other blocks) to draw a house around the lion.
        turtle_3_5: 'Now create a new "draw a house" function and use it to house
          two cats. Hint: create a new function using the "do something" block, and
          type your own text to name the block.'
        turtle_3_6: 'Using "draw a square" as an example, add an input named "length"
          to "draw a triangle". Then, draw triangles in different sizes. (Hint: click
          the star to add an input to a function)'
        turtle_3_7: Add an input named "length" to "draw a house" and build a big
          house for the elephant (with edges 150 pixels long)
        turtle_3_8: Modify "draw a house" so I end up at the bottom right corner after
          drawing a new house. Use this modified function to draw three houses.
        turtle_3_9: Can you re-create the "draw a house" function without help? Try
          it, and then draw a row of houses.
        turtle_3_10: You've learned a lot! Now use it to draw whatever you want. Try
          to draw a star, or a spiral, or a fancy snowflake.
        maze_karel_debug_seq_1: Welcome to debugging! My code doesn't work right.
          Can you spot the problem and fix it so that I can get my field flat and
          ready for planting?
        maze_karel_debug_seq_2: What's wrong with this program? How should you fix
          it so I can remove that pile?
        maze_karel_debug_repeat: De-bug this program for me so my field will be nice
          and flat.
        maze_karel_debug_while: How should you change this program to help me fill
          the hole?
        maze_karel_debug_if: Help! Fix the program so my field will be completely
          flat.
        maze_karel_debug_if_else: De-bug this program so I can fill in the holes and
          remove all the piles.
        maze_karel_debug_function_1: What should you change about this program to
          help me remove all the piles?
        maze_karel_debug_function_2: Can you de-bug this program for me so I can make
          my field flat?
        maze_karel_debug_function_3: 'Edit this program so I''ll remove all the piles
          on my field. '
        turtle_5_1: Try running this program, and make changes to see what happens.
          Can you figure out how it works? (Or delete it and replace it with something
          totally different)
        turtle_5_2: Try running this program, and make changes to see what happens.
          Can you figure out how it works? (Or delete it and replace it with something
          totally different)

          totally different)
        turtle_5_6: Try running this program, and make changes to see what happens.
          Can you figure out how it works? (Or delete it and replace it with something
          totally different)
        maze_3_1: I need to get to that pig! Type in a couple of calls to move();
          so I can get my eggs back.
        maze_3_2: Write me a program, so I can make it all the way to the pig.
        maze_3_3: How should I get to the pig? Make sure I don't run into the box
          of TNT!
        maze_3_4: Argh! Write me a program that gets me around the TNT and to the
          pig.
