      4-5 Artist Patterns 1_instruction: |
        Can you draw this square using a loop?
        Each side is 20 pixels long.
      4-5 Artist Patterns 10_instruction: |
        This code draws two rows of hexagons -
        loop the whole thing 4 times to draw the whole honeycomb. Hint: You'll need
        to jump back 120 pixels in your outermost loop to make sure the artist doesn't
        draw off the screen.
      4-5 Artist Patterns 11_instruction: |
        How many times do you need to loop this
        to draw a half circle? Hint: if there's 360 degrees in a circle and each
        loop moves 3 degrees, how many times would you need to loop draw a full circle?
      4-5 Artist Patterns 12_instruction: |
        If you copy that loop and turn left instead
        of right, what happens? Can you repeat that to draw this wave?
      4-5 Artist Patterns 13_instruction: |
        Now let's loop that whole thing four
        times to create this picture frame. Watch out for the corners - you can't
        just turn 90 degrees! If looping a 3 degree turn 60 times makes a half circle,
        which of these blocks of code will make a quarter circle for the corners?
      4-5 Artist Patterns 2_instruction: |
        If you place your square loop inside another
        loop, we call that a nested loop. What do you need to add to your outer loop
        to make sure all 15 squares line up next to each other?
      4-5 Artist Patterns 3_instruction: |
        Now let's go one level deeper! We've
        nested that whole block of code into another loop, but you need to get the
        artist back in place to draw the next line. Which of these code blocks can
        you place at the end of the outermost loop to draw the whole grid?
      4-5 Artist Patterns 4_instruction: |

        How many times do you need to repeat
        this block to draw the full grid of diamonds?
      4-5 Artist Patterns 5_instruction: |
        Let's repeat that to make a row of 6 diamonds.
        Notice that we changed our diamond code to repeat 3 times instead of 2 - why
        do you think that is?
      4-5 Artist Patterns 6_instruction: |
        How many times do you need to repeat this
        block to draw the full grid of diamonds?
      4-5 Artist Patterns 7_instruction: |
        Let's modify the code from the last puzzle
        to make this more complex pattern. Notice how the diamonds overlap now, try
        changing the first "jump backwards" from 100 to 50 (half as far) - now how
        far should the artist go in the second "jump backwards"?
      4-5 Artist Patterns 8_instruction: |
        Use a loop to draw this hexagon with 40
        pixel sides and 60 degree angles.
      4-5 Artist Patterns 9.5_instruction: |
        Let's loop this code to draw two rows
        of hexagons. Notice how our second row is shifted to the right.
      4-5 Artist Patterns 9_instruction: |
        Now repeat that code 3 times to draw the
        whole row. Hint, each hexagon is 80 pixels wide from the furthest points left
        to right.

        variables you like, and then click finish to move on.
      Big Game Animation 2 (copy 1)_instruction: |
        The function 'update-target'
        function takes the target's current x value, and returns an updated value.
        Complete the 'update-target' function so that it adds to the x value each
        time it is called. The more you add to x, the faster the target will go.
      Big Game Animation 2_instruction: |
        The update-target function takes the target's
        current x value, and returns an updated value. Complete the update-target
        function so that it adds to the x value each time it is called. The more you
        add to x, the faster the target will go.
      Big Game Animation 3_instruction: |
        The update-danger function should work just
        like update-target, except that the danger should move from the right side
        over towards the left. Complete update-danger to make the danger fly across
        the screen.
      Big Game Animation 4_instruction: |
        At this point in your game, your danger
        should run across the screen from right to left, and your target should run
        across from left to right. They don't ever come back on screen once they've
        left, but we'll take care of that later. Take a minute to make sure your
        game is working like you want it to, and then click "Finish" to move on.
      Big Game Booleans 1_instruction: |
        When you last worked on your game we got
        our target and danger sprites to fly across the screen, but they never come
        back. Click "Run" to see how your game is currently working, and then click
        finish and we'll work on making those sprites reappear on screen after they've
        left.
      Big Game Booleans 2_instruction: |
        Go to the Functions section of the toolbox
        and complete the safe-left? function so that it returns true if the sprite's
        x coordinate is greater than -50. If you're successful you should see the
        Danger go off the left side and then return on the right side.
      Big Game Booleans 3_instruction: |
        Now that you've got safe-left?, let's fill
        in safe-right? - it should take in a sprite's x coordinate and return true
        if that coordinate is less than 450. Once your safe-right? is complete you
        should see the Target go off the right side of the screen and return on the
        left.
      Big Game Booleans 4_instruction: |
        Complete the onscreen? function so that it
        checks whether both safe-left? and safe-right? are true.
      Big Game Booleans 5_instruction: |
        At this point your Danger should run across
        the screen from right to left, your Target should run across from left to
        right, and they should both return to the opposite side, repeatedly. Take
        a minute to make sure your game is working like you want it to, and then click
        "Finish" to move on.
      Big Game Collision 1 (copy 1)_instruction: |

        finish and we'll work on making those sprites reappear on screen after they've
        left.
      Big Game Collision 1_instruction: |
        At this point you've programmed a video
        game with a moving Target and Danger, both of which return to the screen once
        they've left, and a Player that responds to keyboard input. Click "Run"
        to see how your game is currently working, and then we'll dig into the final
        missing piece - collision detection!
      Big Game Collision 2_instruction: |
        To move the player up and down, we'll need
        to use a conditional block to figure out which key is pressed and respond
        accordingly. Computers read keypresses as numeric key codes - the up arrow
        is 38 and the down arrow is 40. You can lookup other key codes in your student
        workbook. Edit the 'update-player' function so that if moves the player
        up when the up arrow is pressed, or down when the down arrow is pressed.
      Big Game Collision 3_instruction: |
        Use the Distance Formula, so the distance
        function returns the distance between the player's center coordinates (px,
        py) and another sprite's center coordinates (cx, cy).
      Big Game Collision 4_instruction: |
        Complete the collide? function so that it
        returns true if the distance between two points is less than 100 pixels apart.

        when we used a variable to control the number of sides in a shape? We are
        going to do the same thing with the "counter" variable now. This pattern
        starts with a triangle and adds one side at a time until it draws a decagon
        (10 sides). Each side should be 100 pixels long. Hint: 360 divided by the
        number of sides a shape has is the number of degrees you'll need to turn.
      Course 4 Artist For Loops 11a_instruction: "Let's put it all together!  Using\nyour
        knowledge of \"for loops\" and the \"counter\", create this drawing where\neach
        shape has two more sides than the last.  Make sure that each side is\n10 times
        as long as the number of sides in the polygon.\r\n\r\nVery little\nof the
        code has been provided for you."
      Course 4 Artist For Loops 12_instruction: "That looked pretty cool, but now\nI'd
        like to draw each shape next to the last one. This time each side is\n20 pixels.
        Use a jump block to jump forward 40 pixels after each shape. \n"
      Course 4 Artist For Loops 13_instruction: |
        Hmmm, those shapes are getting bigger
        every time! Didn't we already solve this problem with variables? How can
        we use the counter variable to make the sides smaller as there are more of
        them? Instead of moving forward by a set amount, try moving forward (100 /
        counter) pixels.
      Course 4 Artist For Loops 14_instruction: |
        If you turn a little bit more or
        less than you normally would for a shape, it creates a neat effect. Try using
        some of the code from the last level, but turning 89 degrees to create this
        twisted square spiral.

        figure out the turns for a shape of "sides". Can you recreate this picture?
        Here's a tip each shape is 100 pixel's in length.
      Course 4 Artist Params 12_instruction: |
        Use your "pinwheel" function to draw

      Course 4 Artist Params 2_instruction: |
        That triangle function would be a whole
        lot more useful if it could draw triangles of different sizes. I've added
        a parameter for line length, but it doesn't do anything yet. Can you update
        the function so it uses the "length" parameter when it draws each side?
        The triangle sizes are 150 pixels, 75 pixels and 25 pixels.
      Course 4 Artist Params 3_instruction: "Awesome, can you draw each of these\ntriangles
        with that new function? The first is 25 pixels long, the second\nis 50, and
        the third is 75. \n"
      Course 4 Artist Params 4_instruction: |
        Can you add a new function called square?
        It should also take a length parameter, just like the triangle. This time
        draw 3 squares 25, 50 and 75 pixels in length,100 pixels apart.
      Course 4 Artist Params 5_instruction: |
        Use both of your new functions to draw
        this picture. To make this easier you use a loop with a "counter" parameter.
      Course 4 Artist Params 6_instruction: "Let's edit this \"draw a shape\" function.\nIt
        already has a \"length\" parameter. Now, let's edit the function to also\nadd
        a \"sides\" parameter. Remember the angle to turn for a given shape is\n360
        divided by the sides it has. Hint: lengths for each shape are the triangle\nis

        Can you figure out how to draw this
        shape? Here's a hint create a new function with 6 sides called a hexagon.
      Course 4 Artist Params 9_instruction: |
        Do you remember when we used the counter
        loop but removed a loop within? Let's have some fun and use the "draw a
        shape" function with "sides" and "length" parameters. Can you re create
        these shapes? The square counter should be 5/100/5, the triangle counter should
        be 10/100/10 and the hexagon is 2/100/2.
      Course 4 Artist Var 9_instruction: |
        Here's the algorithm to draw a triangle,
        modify it so it uses the "sides" variable instead. Replace the number 3

      Course 4 Artist Vars 1_instruction: |
        Can you help me draw an equilateral triangle?
        It has to be exactly 100 pixels long on each side.
      Course 4 Artist Vars 10_instruction: |
        Here's an algorithm that draws a triangle
        out of smaller triangles. Can you modify it so that it uses the "sides"
        variable to draw each triangle? Look through the code, and every time you
        see the number 3, replace it with your "sides" variable. Remember to use
        the "set sides" block.
      Course 4 Artist Vars 11_instruction: |
        Here’s more complicated code using the
        same concepts from the last puzzle - what should you set the "sides" variable
        to in order to draw this picture made of squares?
      Course 4 Artist Vars 12_instruction: |
        Let's set the "sides" variable to
        5. The more sides we add to this algorithm, the bigger this whole pattern
        gets! Notice that there is another variable called "length". We can now
        use that wherever we have a "move forward." Set the "length" variable
        to 75 for this shape.
      Course 4 Artist Vars 13_instruction: "When a shape has lots of sides, each\nside
        needs to be shorter if you want the whole pattern to fit on the screen.\n\r\nLet's
        recreate the algorithm for this amazing pattern, but instead of\nmanually
        setting the \"length\" variable, let's use a math block with the\n\"sides\"
        variable inside to make sure that each shape fits correctly. The\nperimeter

        color!  Use random colors inside loops to see how it changes your design."
      Course 4 Artist Vars 2_instruction: |
        Instead of using "move forward by 150,"
        the "move" block is now referencing a variable called "length." Can you
        set "length" to 150 to draw this new triangle?
      Course 4 Artist Vars 3_instruction: "Here's a loop that draws a square, but\nsomething's
        missing. Can you fix it so that it uses the variable \"length\"\nto figure
        out how long each side should be? \n"
      Course 4 Artist Vars 4_instruction: |
        Now I want to make a rectangle that is
        twice as tall as it is wide. We've got a variable called "width" that needs
        to be set to 100. Can you use the math blocks to complete the code?
      Course 4 Artist Vars 5_instruction: |
        Use the variable "sides" to control
        how many times this loop gets run.

      Course 4 Artist Vars 8_instruction: |
        Free Play: Experiment with the number
        of sides this shape has. Can you change the algorithm so that the overall
        size of the shape stays the same, no matter how many sides it has? Hint: If
        you divide your starting length by the number of sides, the length of each
        side will get shorter as the number of sides gets higher.
      Course 4 Artist Vars 9_instruction: |
        Modify this algorithm so it uses the "sides"
        variable instead of a fixed number to draw a triangle. Don't forget to use
        the "set sides to" block.

        your increment be to collect 9, then 6, and then 3 nectar?
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 11_instruction: |
        What's wrong with this loop? See if
        you can fix it and make the bee collect all the nectar.
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 2_instruction: |
        Here's a new kind of loop, called the
        "for" loop. This particular for loop will count from 1 to 5 by 1, and run
        the contents of the loop each time it counts. Help the Bee get the nectar.
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 3_instruction: |
        You can solve this puzzle by using a

        Can you use the loop variable to control
        movement and nectar collection?
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 9_instruction: |
        The last number in your for loop is
        called the "increment,"  and each time the loop is run the counter variable
        changes by the increment. Try collecting these flowers using an increment
        of 2.

      Course 4 Bee Params 1_instruction: |
        Use the function "get 3 nectar" which
        turns, moves to collect the nectar, and then returns to the original location.
        Write a sequence to collect all of the nectar using "get 3 nectar."
      Course 4 Bee Params 2_instruction: |
        Modify the "get 3 nectar" function so
        it makes me turn right instead of left to the flowers.
      Course 4 Bee Params 3 (copy 1)_instruction: |
        Now there are flowers on both
        sides! Maybe you can use a parameter so that the same function works for flowers
        on either side. I've added a parameter called "direction" to the function.
        If the "direction" parameter equals 0 I should turn left, if it's 1 I should
        turn right.
      Course 4 Bee Params 3_instruction: "Now there are flowers on both sides! We've\nadded
        variables called \"left\" and \"right\" for you to use, and added a\nparameter

      Course 4 Binary 1_instruction: |
        Here's a function that takes a binary string
        of 1's and 0's and instructs the farmer to turn on the go from left to right,
        top to bottom, turning on the squares where the number has a zero. Run the
        code provided to see how the farmers uses binary to draw an image.

      Course 4 Play Lab For Loops 2_instruction: |
        This time, let's try counting
        the odd numbers from 1 to 100.
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 1_instruction: |
        Here's a function called "jump"
        that causes your main character to jump up 100 pixels. Use the jump function
        to collect all of the flags.
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 10_instruction: "We've added one last function for\nyou.
        \r\n\r\nUse an \"if\" statement to program your game to call the \"level_up\"\nfunction
        only when \"player_score\" becomes greater than a certain number.\r\n\r\nFor\nexample:
        \"player_score\" > 6\r\n\r\nPlay the game, and make it past level\n4 to move
        to the next puzzle. "
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 2_instruction: "Now we've got flags that are too\nhigh
        for our current jump! Let's use both the \"up\" and \"down\" arrows\nso that
        we can have multiple jump heights.  \r\n\r\nWe need to add a parameter\nto
        our jump function called \"height\".  The up arrow should cause the dog\nto
        jump 200 pixels and the down arrow should make it jump only 100 pixels.\n\r\n\r\nHint:
        You will need to click \"edit\" on the jump function and update\nit so that
        it uses the \"height\" parameter."
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 3_instruction: "We have added another parameter to\nthe
        jump function so that we can use it with other actors. Each actor is represented\nby
        a number, starting from one. Edit the \"jump\" function so that it uses\nthe
        \"actor\" parameter to make the correct character jump. \n"
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 4_instruction: |
        Here's a function called "patrol."
        Edit it to move Cat up 400 pixels and then down 400 pixels.
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 5_instruction: |
        Edit the the "patrol" function to
        add an "actor" parameter, so that we can call it for each of the actors
        on the screen. Remember, the actors correspond to numbers 1, 2, and 3.
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 6_instruction: |
        Add another parameter called "speed"
        to the "patrol" function. Try using a "set speed" block with the new "speed"
        parameter to help Penguin get both flags before the other sprites even get
        one.
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 7_instruction: "Let's have some fun! Look at the\ncode
        provided to see if you can figure out what each block does.  \r\n\r\nWhen\nyou're
        done, use the arrow keys to control Dog and collect all of the flags."
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 8_instruction: |
        Use a "when actor touches" block
        to send Dog back to the top-left ONLY if Dog touches any of the other actors.
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 9_instruction: "Here's our game from an earlier stage,\nbut
        most of the code is hidden. There’s a new function \"score_points.\"\r\n\r\nEdit\nthe
        function so that a \"points\" parameter is added to the \"player_score\"\nvariable.
        \r\n\r\nThe variable \"player_score\" should increase each time\nDog tags
        Cat with hearts, and decrease each time that Cat tags Dog with hearts.\r\n\r\nNote:\nWhen
        you're done, click \"Run\" to play.  When Dog scores 6 points, you will\nmove
        on to the next puzzle. "
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 1_instruction: |
        This time you don't have to write any
        code, just hit "Run" to play the game! In this game, you're the dog who
        is trying to collect more flags than the cat. Use the down arrow to control
        the dog. Press "Finish" when you're done playing.
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 2_instruction: |
        The race in that last puzzle wasn't
        very fair! Change the "dog_speed" variable to make sure you can collect
        more flags than Cat. The first to collect 10 flags wins!
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 3_instruction: |
        Here's a new kind of game! Use the
        left and right arrows to move, and the up arrow to jump. See if you can collect
        all of the flags.
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 4_instruction: |
        Now we're using a variable called "height"
        to control how high the dog can jump. Update the "height" variable so that
        the dog can jump high enough to reach all the flags.
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 5_instruction: "Let's build a game! First we'll need\na
        score. Rebuild the code that you saw in the last level to set the score\nto
        10. \n"
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 6 (copy 1)_instruction: |
        Cool, now we've got our score
        variable, but how are we going to make it useful? How about adding to your
        score variable each time you hit the enemy with a fireball? Use the "when
        actor 2 touches anything" event to trigger an update to your score when your
        fireballs hit the cat. You can increment the score by setting score = score
        + 1. Get your score up to 10 (going one at a time!) to pass the level.
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 6_instruction: "Use the right arrow to shoot hearts.\r\n\r\nIn\nour
        game, how should we score points? Add 1 to your \"points\" variable each\ntime
        Dog hits Cat with a heart. Use the \"when actor 2 touches anything\"\nevent
        to trigger an update to your score. You can increment your variable\nby setting
        \"points = points + 1.\" Get your score up to 10 (going one at\na time!) to
        pass the level."
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 7_instruction: |
        Nice, now let's make sure this game
        isn't too easy to play. Any time Dog (actor 1) gets hit by yellow hearts
        from Cat (actor 2), you should lose a point. Start with 10 points so it's
        not too hard. Let your score drop down from 10 to 0 to pass the level.
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 8 (copy 1)_instruction: |
        Alright, one last thing for
        this game - let's set it up so the player can win (or lose). Use a forever
        loop to check the value of score - if score is ever greater that 20, make
        the enemy vanish. If the score is every less than 0, make the player vanish.
        Click "Finish" when the game works like you'd like it to.

        Let's set up this game so the Dog can
        win (or lose). Use a forever loop to check the value of score - if score is

        works like you'd like it to.
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 9_instruction: "Free Play time! Here are all of the\nvariables

      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 1_instruction: |
        Let's make the dog speak every
        number from 1 to 100. Use a for loop and the counter block to speak the counter
        variable each time the loop is run.
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 2_instruction: |
        This time, let's try counting
        the odd numbers from 1 to 100.
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 3_instruction: |
        If we count by larger numbers,
        we count even higher in the same amount of time. Try making the dog count
        from 10 up to 1000, 10 at a time.
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 4_instruction: |
        Changing the increment can be
        helpful, but we're still counting linearly (each number is the same distance
        from the last) What if I wanted to count exponentially? Without changing the
        settings in this for loop, can you count 1, 4, 9 , 16, 25... (counter squared)?
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 4a_instruction: "Now, let's blend the variables\nfrom
        Stage 7 together with your \"counter\" variable to make some magic happen.
        \  \r\n\r\nIn\nthis puzzle, Dog will count from 0 to 1000 by \"increment\".
        \ Set the \"increment\"\nvariable to 10 at the beginning of your code to see
        what happens."
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 5_instruction: |
        In the last stage we counted the
        square of each number. Try changing "counter ^ 2" to "counter ^ 3" to
        count the cube of each number (1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343…)
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 5a_instruction: "In this puzzle, Dog will be your\ntime
        keeper.\r\n\r\nDog will count from 0 to 30 by \"increment\".  The \"increment\"\nvariable
        will begin with a value of 1.\r\n\r\nCan you make it so that each\ntime you
        click Dog, the increment increases by 2?  Click the forward arrow\nto run
        the for loop.\r\n\r\nRun the loop a couple of times, clicking Dog before\neach
        one."
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 6_instruction: |
        You may recall that a prime number
        is any whole number that is only divisible by itself and 1. Use the "is_prime"
        function to speak out only the prime numbers from 1 to 100.
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 6a_instruction: "Dog will still keep time by counting\nwith
        our \"for loop\" by \"increment\", but this time, we will add The Wizard\ninto
        the mix.  Can you change the code so that \"increment\" goes up by two\neach

        function to draw this pattern.
      NEW Course 4 Artist Params 1_instruction: |
        Let's define this function to draw
        a square with 50 pixel sides. Click "edit" to get started.
      NEW Course 4 Artist Params 10_instruction: "Create a \"draw a hexagon\" function\nblock
        with a length parameter. Hint: This hexagon has sides that are 100 pixels\nin
        length. \n"
      NEW Course 4 Artist Params 11_instruction: |
        Can you figure out how to draw
        this shape? Edit the function to use the "sides" parameter.
      NEW Course 4 Artist Params 12_instruction: |
        Can you complete this drawing?
        The sides of all the shapes are 100 pixels long.
      NEW Course 4 Artist Params 12a_instruction: |
        This image is similar to the last.
        Can you use a "for loop" with your function to make this design?
      NEW Course 4 Artist Params 13_instruction: "Let's edit this \"draw a polygon\"\nfunction.
        It already has a \"sides\" parameter. Now, let's add a \"length\"\nparameter.
        \r\nHint: The perimeter of each shape is 200 pixels long. Do you\nremember
        the equation to make shapes the same size when they have a different\nnumber
        of sides?"
      NEW Course 4 Artist Params 14_instruction: |
        Edit "draw a spiral edge" to
        use "length" and "sides" parameters, then recreate these shapes.

      NEW Course 4 Artist Params 6_instruction: |
        Fill in the "length" parameter
        to draw these shapes by replacing the "???" with the right numbers. The
        square and triangle have 100 pixels sides while each side of the hexagon is
        75 pixels long.
      NEW Course 4 Artist Params 7_instruction: |
        Can you complete this drawing? Hint:
        The sides of each triangle are 25 pixels larger than the last.  The first
        triangle has 25 pixel sides.
      NEW Course 4 Artist Params 8_instruction: |
        The code for this triangle function
        is broken. Can you edit the function to fix it, and then make triangles of

      NEW Course 4 Artist Params 9_instruction: |
        Click "edit" to fill in the function
        definition of "draw a square" and add a parameter. It should take a length
        parameter, just like the triangle. This time, draw 3 squares: 25, 50 and 75
        pixels in length, each 100 pixels apart.

        Use a loop to collect the nectar
        from each flower.
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 10_instruction: |
        Use your for loop "counter" variable
        to control how far to move horizontally.
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 10a_instruction: |
        Ready for a challenge?  Take what
        you've learned about loops and try to solve this problem. Remember: You may
        have to run your solution multiple times before you figure out all of the
        steps.
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 11_instruction: |
        Can you use the loop variable to
        control movement and nectar collection?
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 2_instruction: |
        Add the code necessary to make sure
        the bee collects all the nectar. Look at how much code you need for this puzzle!
        (We'll learn a simpler way in the next puzzle.)
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 3_instruction: "Ah, the \"for loop\" makes this\nmuch
        easier! All the code you need is here, take a look at how it is put together\nthen
        click \"Run\" to see how it works. \n"
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 4 4_instruction: |
        Now we need to move forward "counter"
        times, then get nectar "counter" times.  Can you use two "repeat" loops
        to solve this challenge?
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 4_instruction: "Replace the ??? in the \"for loop\"\nwith
        the largest amount of nectar the bee has to collect. \n"
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 5 5_instruction: |
        Are you getting the hang of using
        the "for loop"? Let's help the bee get the rest of the nectar.
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 5_instruction: |
        You can also use a "for loop"
        to count down. Try gathering this nectar by counting down from 5 to 1 by 1.
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 6_instruction: |
        The last number in your for loop
        is called the "increment". Each time the loop is run, the counter variable
        changes by the value of the increment. Try collecting these flowers using
        an increment of 2.
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 7_instruction: "Now, let's combine the \"counter\"\nvariable
        with a math block! How can you use the \"counter\" variable to navigate\nthis
        garden with the fewest number of blocks possible? What do you need to\ndo
        to collect 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 nectar this time? The secret is in the \"counter\"\nvariable!\r\n\r\nRemember:
        If your loop is counting up, the increment is added\nto your \"counter\" variable
        each time through."
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 8_instruction: "You've got this! What should your\nincrement
        be to collect 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 nectar?\r\nHint: What do you need\nto add to
        each number to get the number after it?"
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 9_instruction: |
        If your loop is counting down, the
        increment is subtracted from your counter variable each loop. What should
        your increment be to collect 15, then 12, then 9, 6, 3 nectar?
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 95_instruction: |
        Take a look at each piece of the

        When you went to PD in the summer, the Conditional
        block that you were introduced to was black and allowed any data type to be
        used. This proved to be confusing, given that every other function we've
        seen always produces the same type of data. To help make conditionals clearer
        and more consistent we've replaced the single black block with a separate
        block for each data type.

        with shades of red. Row 2 - shades of green. Row 3 - shades of blue. Row 4
        - shades of gray.
      Pixelation - Lesson 15 - Color Shades_instruction: |
        We start you out with the
        row of shades of red that Maddie created in the video. Experiment with 6-bit
        color by filling in the bottom row of the image with shades of a different
        color. Here is an example with some shades of blue. Try your own color!
      Pixelation - Lesson 15 - Complete 3-bit color_instruction: |
        We start you with
        the 4x2 image Maddie was creating, but we've left out the last two squares.
        Finish off the image by figuring out which two colors are missing and encode
        them.
      Pixelation 2_instruction: |
        Something happened to the bits in this image!  Find
        error and fix it!
      Pixelation 4x4 Empty_instruction: |
        The width and height are now encoded in
        the pixel data. Can you figure out how to adjust the dimensions?
      Pixelation Bee_instruction: |
        This larger image of a bee encodes color with
        12 bits per pixel, but viewing in hex makes it easier to see the color of
        each pixel. If you switch to binary mode - hold on to your hat - it's a lot
        of bits. Here's another mind-blowing thing to try: slide the bits per pixel
        up to 24 bits per pixel. What happens? Can you explain this behavior?
      Pixelation Flappy_instruction: |
        Here is a bigger image at 9 bits per pixel.
        With 9 bits per pixel you can express 512 different colors. Click through
        to see the next image which is even more sophisticated, but easier to understand.

        A rocket blasts off, traveling at 15 meters
        per second... press "Run" to see how this word problem looks as an animation.
      Play Lab Rocket 2_instruction: |
        We've started the Design Recipe for rocket-height
        using the contract and examples you just wrote. Complete the function definition
        for rocket-height and run your animation.
      Play Lab Rocket 2B_instruction: |
        A rocket blasts off, traveling at 15 meters
        per second. Using the Design Recipe, write a function called rocket-height
        that takes in a number of  seconds that have passed since the rocket took
        off, and produces the height of the rocket at that time.
      Play Lab Rocket 3_instruction: |
        Awesome, now can you update that function so
        that our rocket moves more quickly? Make sure to update the purpose statement,
        examples, and function definition to launch a rocket at 40 meters per second.
      Play Lab Rocket 4 (copy 1)_instruction: |
        Real rockets start off slowly and
        gain speed over time - let's make ours do the same! Write an exponential
        function that describes a rocket that travels at "seconds" squared meters
        per second.
      Play Lab Rocket 4_instruction: |
        Real rockets start off slowly and gain speed
        over time - so let's add some simple acceleration to ours! Can you write
        a function that describes a rocket that is at 10 meters at 1 second, 40 meters
        at 2 seconds, 90 meters at 3 seconds, 160 at 4 seconds and so on?
      Play Lab Rocket 5_instruction: |
        Much better, but let's write one more function
        with simple acceleration. This time the rocket should be 15 meters at 1 second,
        45 meters at 2 seconds, 95 at 3 seconds, and 165 at 4 seconds.

      Sam the Butterfly 1 (copy 1)_instruction: |
        This butterfly is named Sam, and
        the game area is Sam’s yard. Sam's yard is 400 pixels wide by 400 pixels
        tall! As you can see, Sam is free to walk around the yard, and the coordinates
        at the top of the screen update to tell you his location. Use the arrow keys
        to move sam around his yard. Help Sam collect all of the flags to move on.
      Sam the Butterfly 1_instruction: |
        This bat is named Sam, and the game area
        is Sam’s yard. Sam's yard is 400 pixels wide by 400 pixels tall! As you can
        see, Sam is free to walk around the yard, and the coordinates at the top of
        the screen update to tell you his location. Click "Run" and then use the
        arrow keys to move Sam around his yard, making note of Sam's coordinates
        at different locations. Click "Finish" when you're ready to move on.
      Sam the Butterfly 2_instruction: |
        Sam's mom wants to make sure that she can
        always see at least a bit of him, so lets write some functions that help make
        sure he doesn't go too far out of the yard. Here's a function called safe-left?
        - it should take a Number for its domain that represents Sam's x-coordinates
        and return true if he's completely visible on screen. If your function works,
        Sam shouldn't be able to leave the yard from the left side.
      Sam the Butterfly 3_instruction: |
        In the last puzzle we kept Sam from leaving
        on the left, now let's do the same thing on the right. Complete the safe-right?
        function to make sure Sam can't go off the right side of the screen.
      Sam the Butterfly 4_instruction: |
        Huh, we can keep Sam from leaving on the
        left, or we can keep him from leaving on the right, but how can we keep him
        safe from leaving both directions? Try using the and block to program the
        function on-screen? to check if Sam is safe-left? and safe-right?
      Sam the Butterfly 5_instruction: |
        Free Play: Awesome, we've kept Sam safe
        on the left and right! Use this free play stage to experiment with your functions
        and further improve onscreen?
      Sam the Butterfly 6_instruction: |
        We've added a new parameter "y" to the
        "on-screen?" function. Update the function so that it checks that "safe-left?"
        AND "safe-right?" AND "safe-up?" are all true. When you've fixed the
        function, try going out of the yard from the left, right, and top sides.
      Sam the Butterfly 7_instruction: |
        Only one last direction to worry about! Create
        a "safe-down?" function and update the "on-screen?" function so that it
        checks up, down, left, and right.
      Sam the Butterfly Complete_instruction: |
        Only one last direction to worry about!

        commands 6 times?
      Standalone_Artist_5.5_instruction: |
        Notice how we simplified the diamond code
        by turning it into a loop. You can loop that whole sequence 12 times to draw
        the flower. Hint: You'll need to turn 30 degrees after your diamond loop
        so you don't keep drawing over the same diamond.
      Standalone_Artist_5_instruction: |
        How many times do you need to loop this diamond
        to draw the flower?
