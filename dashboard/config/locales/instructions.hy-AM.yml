      Course 4 Artist Vars 10_instruction: |-
        Here's an algorithm that draws a triangle
        out of smaller triangles. Can you modify it so that it uses the "sides"
        variable to draw each triangle? Look through the code, and every time you
        see the number 3, replace it with your "sides" variable. Remember to use
        the "set sides" block.
      Course 4 Artist Vars 11_instruction: |-
        Here’s more complicated code using the
        same concepts from the last puzzle - what should you set the "sides" variable
        to in order to draw this picture made of squares?
      Course 4 Artist Vars 12_instruction: |-
        Let's set the "sides" variable to
        5. The more sides we add to this algorithm, the bigger this whole pattern
        gets! Notice that there is another variable called "length". We can now
        use that wherever we have a "move forward." Set the "length" variable
        to 75 for this shape.
      Course 4 Artist Vars 13_instruction: "When a shape has lots of sides, each\nside
        needs to be shorter if you want the whole pattern to fit on the screen.\n\r\nLet's
        recreate the algorithm for this amazing pattern, but instead of\nmanually
        setting the `length` variable, let's use a math block with the `sides`\nvariable
        inside to make sure that each shape fits correctly. The perimeter\nof each

        color!  Use random colors inside loops to see how it changes your design."
      Course 4 Artist Vars 2_instruction: |-
        Instead of using "move forward by 150,"
        the "move" block is now referencing a variable called "length." Can you
        set "length" to 150 to draw this new triangle?
      Course 4 Artist Vars 3_instruction: |-
        Here's a loop that draws a square, but
        something's missing. Can you fix it so that it uses the variable "length"
        to figure out how long each side should be?
      Course 4 Artist Vars 4_instruction: |-
        Now I want to make a rectangle that is
        twice as tall as it is wide. We've got a variable called "width" that needs
        to be set to 100. Can you use the math blocks to complete the code?
      Course 4 Artist Vars 5_instruction: |-
        Use the variable "sides" to control
        how many times this loop gets run.

      Course 4 Artist Vars 8_instruction: |-
        Free Play: Experiment with the number
        of sides this shape has. Can you change the algorithm so that the overall
        size of the shape stays the same, no matter how many sides it has? Hint: If
        you divide your starting length by the number of sides, the length of each
        side will get shorter as the number of sides gets higher.
      Course 4 Artist Vars 9_instruction: |-
        Modify this algorithm so it uses the "sides"
        variable instead of a fixed number to draw a triangle. Don't forget to use
        the "set sides to" block.

      Course 4 Bee For Loops 10_instruction: |-
        If your loop is counting down, the
        increment is subtracted from your counter variable each loop. What should
        your increment be to collect 9, then 6, and then 3 nectar?
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 11_instruction: |-
        What's wrong with this loop? See if
        you can fix it and make the bee collect all the nectar.
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 2_instruction: |-
        Here's a new kind of loop, called the
        "for" loop. This particular for loop will count from 1 to 5 by 1, and run
        the contents of the loop each time it counts. Help the Bee get the nectar.
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 3_instruction: |-
        You can solve this puzzle by using a
        for loop to count from 1 to 3 by 1. Now let's go get some nectar!
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 4_instruction: |-
        Collect all of the nectar from these
        flowers. I wonder if there's an easier way to do this...
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 5_instruction: |-
        Ah, the for loop makes this much easier!
        Using the "counter" variable from the for loop to loop the "get nectar"
        block the same number of times as the loop. Whew! That's a lot of loops.
        All the code you need it there, take a look at how it is put together then
        click on Run and see how it works.
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 6_instruction: |-
        You can also use a for loop to count
        down. Try gathering this nectar by counting down from 5 to 1 by 1.
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 7_instruction: |-
        Use your for loop "counter" variable
        to control how far to move horizontally.
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 8_instruction: |-
        Can you use the loop variable to control
        movement and nectar collection?
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 9_instruction: |-
        The last number in your for loop is
        called the "increment,"  and each time the loop is run the counter variable
        changes by the increment. Try collecting these flowers using an increment
        of 2.

        Now there are flowers on both
        sides! Maybe you can use a parameter so that the same function works for flowers
        on either side. I've added a parameter called "direction" to the function.
        If the "direction" parameter equals 0 I should turn left, if it's 1 I should
        turn right.
      Course 4 Bee Params 3_instruction: |-
        Now there are flowers on both sides! We've
        added variables called "left" and "right" for you to use, and added a

        Alright, one last thing for this game
        - let's set it up so the player can win (or lose). Use a forever loop to
        check the value of score - if score is ever greater that 20, make the emeny
        vanish. If the score is every less than 0, make the player vanish.
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 1_instruction: |-
        Let's make the dog speak every
        number from 1 to 100. Use a `for` loop and the counter block to speak the
        counter variable each time the loop is run.
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 3_instruction: |-
        If we count by larger numbers,
        we count even higher in the same amount of time. Try making Pirate Pegleg
        count from 10 up to 1000, adding 10 at a time.
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 4_instruction: |-
        Changing the increment can be
        helpful, but we're still counting linearly (each number is the same distance
        from the last) What if I wanted to count exponentially? Without changing the
        settings in this for loop, can you count 1, 4, 9 , 16, 25... (counter squared)?
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 4a_instruction: "Now, let's blend the variables\nfrom
        Stage 7 together with your \"counter\" variable to make some magic happen.
        \  \r\n\r\nIn\nthis puzzle, Dog will count from 0 to 1000 by \"increment\".
        \ Set the \"increment\"\nvariable to 10 at the beginning of your code to see
        what happens."
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 5_instruction: |-
        In the last stage we counted the
        square of each number. Try changing "counter ^ 2" to "counter ^ 3" to
        count the cube of each number (1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343…)
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 6_instruction: |-
        You may recall that a prime number
        is any whole number that is only divisible by itself and 1. Use the "is_prime"
        function to speak out only the prime numbers from 1 to 100.
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 6a_instruction: "Dog will still keep time by counting\nwith
        our \"for loop\" by \"increment\", but this time, we will add The Wizard\ninto

      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 7_instruction: |-
        Could you use a for loop to help

      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 7a_instruction: "Now we're getting somewhere!  What\nif
        we start counting how many times we can click The Wizard before Dog gets\nto
        30?  \r\n\r\nFinish adding blocks to The Wizard so that every time he's\nclicked
        the variable \"clicked\" increases by one. You can ignore \"increment\"\nfor

      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 8_instruction: "Now, help the actors move as they\ncount.
        \ \r\n\r\nDog should move and count by adding 2 (counter + 2) each time.  Cat\nwill
        move and count by multiplying by 2 (counter * 2)  each time. Penguin\nwill
        move and count to the power of 2 (counter ^ 2) each time.  Who will reach\ntheir
        flag first?"
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 8a_instruction: "To finish our game, we need to\nbring
        back the \"increment\" variable!    Let's tie it to the level of the\ngame.\\\r\n\\\r\n1)
        Keep track of the number of times The Wizard is clicked.\\\r\n2)\nIf The Wizard
        is clicked at least 10 times before Dog counts to 30, raise\n\"increment\"
