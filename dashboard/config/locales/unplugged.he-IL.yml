          יקבלו הזדמנות להתנסות בתפקיד של מהנדס תכנה. בסוף הפעילות, כל תמיד יחזור
          עם רשימת התוכן הנלמד בשיעור. אין צורך להבהל מללמד את הילדים את אוצר המילים
          הנדרש לשיעורים הבאים, פעילות זו יכולה להיות מהנה וקלילה, ותתרום הרבה יותר
          מלחכות להזדמנויות אחרות."

        desc: By programming one another to draw pictures, students will begin to
          understand what programming is really about. The class will begin by students
          instructing each other to color squares in on graph paper in an effort to
          reproduce an existing picture.  If there's time, the lesson can conclude
          with images that the students create themselves.

          the first exercise will show how important it is to make each instruction
          as clear and unambiguous as possible.  Afterward, the class will explore
          how many ways you can fold paper into a rectangle, noting how some methods
          can take more or fewer folds than others.

        title: "פונקציות"
        desc: In this lesson, students will make a suncatcher out of string, beads,
          and a special charm. The students will follow a series of repetitive steps,
          then be asked to identify certain sets of "skills" that are duplicated several
          times. Once those skills are defined, they will be called from a main program
          and the whole beautiful process of creation will be recorded on a single
          sheet of paper. The final program will be geared toward the entire class,
          whatever their type of string, beads, and charms. To effectively allow for
          this, students will need to "abstract out" the details of their specific
          materials and create vague terms for an individual's supplies.  This use
          of generic placeholders is a wonderful introduction to variables.

          take an activity that's already common knowledge and shift it into a solid
          education on defining and calling functions. Once students are familiar
          with the define/call process, we will add the extra capabilities that come
          along with passing parameters within those function calls.

          an algorithm simple there are lots of ways to use it. If you want to make
          sure everyone ends up with the same thing, then your algorithm needs more
          detail.

      EnvelopeVariables:
        title: Envelope Variables
        desc: Variables allow for a lot of freedom in computer science.  This lesson
          helps to explain what variables are and how we can use them in many different
          ways. Use this activity before (or in conjunction with) the lesson on abstraction
          to really hit the idea home.

          to understand.  This activity will have your students analyzing stories
          for differences so that they can abstract them away. Those abstracted stories
          become templates for fun and crazy new ones.

          is the function.  Functions (sometimes called procedures) are mini programs
          that you can use over and over inside of your bigger program. This lesson

      BinaryImages:
        title: Binary Images
        desc: Though many people think of binary as strictly zeros and ones, our previous
          courses taught students that information can be represented in a variety
          of binary options.  This lesson takes that concept one step further as it
          illustrates how a computer can store even more complex information (such
          as images and colors) in binary, as well.
