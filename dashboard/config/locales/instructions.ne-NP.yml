        the largest amount of nectar the bee has to collect. "

        Are you getting the hang of using
        the "for loop"? Let's help the bee get the rest of the nectar.
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 5_instruction: |-

      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 6_instruction: |-
        The last number in your for loop

        an increment of 2.
