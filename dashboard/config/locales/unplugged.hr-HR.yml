        desc: Ova lekcija će predstaviti koncept računalne znanosti i objasniti što
          radi računalni znanstvenik. Studenti će također dobiti mogućnost biti u
          ulozi računalnog znanstvenika. Do kraja lekcije, svaki student dobit će
          podsjetnik svega što je naučio/la. Možda nećete htjeti naučiti djecu neke
          od kompliciranijih riječi koje dolaze uz lekcije, no upoznanje s takvim
          riječima na jednostavan i zabavan način je pno produktivnije  nego čekanje
          pogodnije situacije.

          (iz unaprjed izabranog kataloga s čludovištima). Cijeli zadatak mora se
          raščlaniti, zatim će timovi analizirati sva čudovišta u katalogu, njihove
          uzorke, uočiti različite detalje čudovišta te na kraju iskoristiti te informacije
          za stvaranje algoritama (upute) crtanja koji će koristiit kako bi drugi
          tim nacrtao to određeno čudovište. Timovi će zatim zamijeniti algoritame
          s drugima i nacrtati čudovište koje taj algoritam opisuje. Prikazuje li

          o čemu se u programiranju zapravo radi. Sat će početi tako što će učenici
          uputiti jedan drugog da oboje kvadrate na grafikon papiru trudeći se da
          prikažu postojeću sliku. Ako bude vremena, lekcija će se zaključiti slikama

        title: Funkcije
        desc: In this lesson, students will make a suncatcher out of string, beads,
          and a special charm. The students will follow a series of repetitive steps,
          then be asked to identify certain sets of "skills" that are duplicated several
          times. Once those skills are defined, they will be called from a main program
          and the whole beautiful process of creation will be recorded on a single
          sheet of paper. The final program will be geared toward the entire class,
          whatever their type of string, beads, and charms. To effectively allow for
          this, students will need to "abstract out" the details of their specific
          materials and create vague terms for an individual's supplies.  This use
          of generic placeholders is a wonderful introduction to variables.

          along with passing parameters within those function calls.

      ComputationalThinking:
        title: Razmišljati poput računala

        desc: This lesson shows us something important about algorithms. If you keep
          an algorithm simple there are lots of ways to use it. If you want to make
          sure everyone ends up with the same thing, then your algorithm needs more
          detail.
      EnvelopeVariables:
        title: Envelope Variables
        desc: Variables allow for a lot of freedom in computer science.  This lesson
          helps to explain what variables are and how we can use them in many different

          to really hit the idea home.
      MadGlibs:
        title: Mad Glibs
        desc: Abstraction is one of the most important skills for a computer scientist
          to understand.  This activity will have your students analyzing stories

          courses taught students that information can be represented in a variety
          of binary options.  This lesson takes that concept one step further as it
          illustrates how a computer can store even more complex information (such
          as images and colors) in binary, as well.

          ### How it Works\r
          When playing the Swipe Right for CS game you will see a series of quotes that you might say to each student. You will swipe right on quotes that you think would be effective in convincing students to enroll in the course and swipe left on statements that you think will not be effective. During the session we will discuss as a group your thoughts on the types of statements that are most effective in getting a student to enroll in CS, and you will have a chance to see how other people in your workshop swiped on each of the arguments. \r

          ## Swipe Right for CS\r
          For this session we'll use a tool called "Swipe Right for CS", which has been developed by our partners at MIT. In Swipe Right for CS, you will read through some student profiles and consider specific statements that you might use to convince him or her to enroll in your CS Principles course. \r

        desc: This lesson calls out ways we use algorithms in our daily lives, using
          the act of planting a seed as an example. It also focuses on the bigger
          picture of computer science and how algorithms play an essential part.

        title: Sigurna putovanja
        desc: The Internet is a powerful, but sometimes dangerous place. Teachers
          introduce how to stay safe while navigating the Internet.

      BigEvent_2018:
        title: Veliki događaj
        desc: Students are introduced to the programming concept of "events," which
          are actions that a computer constantly monitors for. The teacher will press
          buttons on a paper remote and students will react depending on which button
          is pressed.

          of binary options.  This lesson takes that concept one step further as it
          illustrates how a computer can store even more complex information (such
          as images and colors) in binary, as well.
