        clear a path to the orange square.
      MC_HOC_2017_08_Cole_markdown_instruction: "Now, instead of destroying before
        you move, you will need to place a block.  \r\n\r\nChange the provided function
        to work for the desert."
      MC_HOC_2017_08_Kiki_markdown_instruction: "Now, instead of destroying cacti,
        you will need to place stone over lava, then destroy sandstone.  \r\n\r\nChange
        the function to work for this level."
      MC_HOC_2017_08_RY_markdown_instruction: "Now there are **TWO** functions to
