          this session we'll use a tool called \"Swipe Right for CS\", which has been
          developed by our partners at MIT. In Swipe Right for CS, you will read through
          some student profiles and consider specific statements that you might use
          to convince him or her to enroll in your CS Principles course. \r\n\r\n###
          How it Works\r\nWhen playing the Swipe Right for CS game you will see a
          series of quotes that you might say to each student. You will swipe right
          on quotes that you think would be effective in convincing students to enroll
          in the course and swipe left on statements that you think will not be effective.
          During the session we will discuss as a group your thoughts on the types
          of statements that are most effective in getting a student to enroll in
          CS, and you will have a chance to see how other people in your workshop
          swiped on each of the arguments. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you click continue below,
          we'll send you to the game, and pass along the Code.org email address you're
          logged in with."
