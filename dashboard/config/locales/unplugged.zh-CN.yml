        title: 计算机概论
        desc: 本课将介绍计算机科学的概念并解释一个计算机科学家的工作内容。它也将给学生一个机会承担一个计算机科学家的角色。该活动结束后，每个学生将带来他们所学的内容的回执。你可以会跳过教幼儿下面课程相关的单词，但现在提高他们的兴趣比等待更好的机会更有效率。

        title: 函数
        desc: In this lesson, students will make a suncatcher out of string, beads,
          and a special charm. The students will follow a series of repetitive steps,
          then be asked to identify certain sets of "skills" that are duplicated several
          times. Once those skills are defined, they will be called from a main program
          and the whole beautiful process of creation will be recorded on a single
          sheet of paper. The final program will be geared toward the entire class,
          whatever their type of string, beads, and charms. To effectively allow for
          this, students will need to "abstract out" the details of their specific
          materials and create vague terms for an individual's supplies.  This use
          of generic placeholders is a wonderful introduction to variables.

        title: 歌曲写作
        desc: Reading lyrics is a pretty intuitive venture for most students.  We'll
          take an activity that's already common knowledge and shift it into a solid
          education on defining and calling functions. Once students are familiar
          with the define/call process, we will add the extra capabilities that come
          along with passing parameters within those function calls.

          erase everything back to that point.
        video: C2_relay_programming
      Conditionals:
        title: 条件语句
        desc: To learn about conditional statements, students play a card game and
          create rules like "If I draw a red card, I get a point" and "If I draw a
          black card, you get a point."
        video: C2_conditionals_with_cards
      BigEvent:
        title: 大事件
        desc: Students are introduced to the programming concept of "events," which
          are actions that a computer constantly monitors for. The teacher will press
          buttons on a paper remote and students will react depending on which button
          is pressed.

          more than one way.
        video: C2_binary_bracelets
      DigitalFootprint:
        title: Your Digital Footprint

      ComputationalThinking:
        title: 计算性思维

      SongwritingParameters:
        title: Songwriting with Parameters
        desc: Students use the concept of the chorus in a song to learn about passing
          parameters (which customize a function without having to rewrite the entire

      TangramAlgorithms:
        title: Tangram Algorithms
        desc: This lesson shows us something important about algorithms. If you keep
          an algorithm simple there are lots of ways to use it. If you want to make

      EnvelopeVariables:
        title: Envelope Variables
        desc: Variables allow for a lot of freedom in computer science.  This lesson
          helps to explain what variables are and how we can use them in many different
          ways. Use this activity before (or in conjunction with) the lesson on abstraction
          to really hit the idea home.

      MadGlibs:
        title: Mad Glibs
        desc: Abstraction is one of the most important skills for a computer scientist
          to understand.  This activity will have your students analyzing stories
          for differences so that they can abstract them away. Those abstracted stories
          become templates for fun and crazy new ones.

      ForLoopFun:
        title: For Loop Fun

        title: 通过输入参数来作曲。
        desc: 'One of the most magnificent structures in the computer science world
          is the function.  Functions (sometimes called procedures) are mini programs
          that you can use over and over inside of your bigger program. This lesson
          will help students intuitively understand why combining chunks of code into
          functions is such a helpful practice.  '

      BinaryImages:
        title: Binary Images
        desc: Though many people think of binary as strictly zeros and ones, our previous
          courses taught students that information can be represented in a variety
          of binary options.  This lesson takes that concept one step further as it
          illustrates how a computer can store even more complex information (such
          as images and colors) in binary, as well.
