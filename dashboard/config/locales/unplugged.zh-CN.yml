        title: 计算机概论
        desc: 本课将介绍计算机科学的概念并解释一个计算机科学家的工作内容。它也将给学生一个机会承担一个计算机科学家的角色。该活动结束后，每个学生将带来他们所学的内容的回执。你可以会跳过教幼儿下面课程相关的单词，但现在提高他们的兴趣比等待更好的机会更有效率。

        title: 计算性思维
        desc: 除了纸和笔不用带别的东西，学生将学习计算思维的四个步骤。简短的介绍后，学生应分成几个小组，在那里他们将为其他小组规划某个怪兽（从预先选定的怪兽目录里）的画法。整个任务必须分解，这样团队才能分析目录里所有怪兽的模式、提取出它们不同的细节，然后使用这些信息来创建算法
          （规划），从而让另一个小组去绘制一个特定的怪兽。每个小组要和别的小组交换算法然后按照别的小组的算法来画怪兽。然后看看画出来的怪兽是不是和原先小组所想的一样？

        title: 方格纸编程
        desc: 编程就像是画画，学生开始去了解什么是编程真正含义。班里的学生在相互的指引下，能根据已有的一张图，在图表上涂上颜色进行模仿。如果有更多的时间，可允许学生创作他们自己的作品。

        title: 函数
        desc: In this lesson, students will make a suncatcher out of string, beads,
          and a special charm. The students will follow a series of repetitive steps,
          then be asked to identify certain sets of "skills" that are duplicated several
          times. Once those skills are defined, they will be called from a main program
          and the whole beautiful process of creation will be recorded on a single
          sheet of paper. The final program will be geared toward the entire class,
          whatever their type of string, beads, and charms. To effectively allow for
          this, students will need to "abstract out" the details of their specific
          materials and create vague terms for an individual's supplies.  This use
          of generic placeholders is a wonderful introduction to variables.

        title: 歌曲写作
        desc: Reading lyrics is a pretty intuitive venture for most students.  We'll
          take an activity that's already common knowledge and shift it into a solid
          education on defining and calling functions. Once students are familiar
          with the define/call process, we will add the extra capabilities that come
          along with passing parameters within those function calls.

        desc: The final wrap-up in the first 20-hour series will help the class relive
          all of their favorite moments, while giving them next steps that they can
          take on their own if they are interested in continuing their computer science
          journey.

      BuildingAFoundation:
        title: 打基础

          erase everything back to that point.
        video: C2_relay_programming
      Conditionals:
        title: 条件语句
        desc: To learn about conditional statements, students play a card game and
          create rules like "If I draw a red card, I get a point" and "If I draw a
          black card, you get a point."
        video: C2_conditionals_with_cards
      BigEvent:
        title: 大事件
        desc: Students are introduced to the programming concept of "events," which
          are actions that a computer constantly monitors for. The teacher will press
          buttons on a paper remote and students will react depending on which button
          is pressed.

          of their name. Students learn that data can be represented and stored in
          more than one way.
        video: C2_binary_bracelets
      DigitalFootprint:
        title: 你的数字足迹

          themselves online creates a digital footprint or "trail" that has consequences.
        video: C2_digital_footprint
      ComputationalThinking:
        title: 计算性思维
        desc: Students use the steps of computational thinking (decompose, pattern
          match, abstract, algorithm) to figure out how to play a game that comes
          with no instructions.
        video: C3_computational_thinking
      FunctionalSuncatchers:
        title: Functional Suncatchers

        video: C3_functional_suncatchers
      SongwritingParameters:
        title: Songwriting with Parameters
        desc: Students use the concept of the chorus in a song to learn about passing
          parameters (which customize a function without having to rewrite the entire

      Crowdsourcing:
        title: Crowdsourcing
        desc: Students use crowdsourcing, a problem-solving technique common in computer
          science, to complete a task together as a classroom more efficiently than
          if a student attempted it alone.

          information, distinguishing what is safe and unsafe to share online.
      TangramAlgorithms:
        title: Tangram Algorithms
        desc: This lesson shows us something important about algorithms. If you keep
          an algorithm simple there are lots of ways to use it. If you want to make
          sure everyone ends up with the same thing, then your algorithm needs more
          detail.

      EnvelopeVariables:
        title: Envelope Variables
        desc: Variables allow for a lot of freedom in computer science.  This lesson
          helps to explain what variables are and how we can use them in many different
          ways. Use this activity before (or in conjunction with) the lesson on abstraction
          to really hit the idea home.

      MadGlibs:
        title: Mad Glibs
        desc: Abstraction is one of the most important skills for a computer scientist
          to understand.  This activity will have your students analyzing stories
          for differences so that they can abstract them away. Those abstracted stories
          become templates for fun and crazy new ones.
        video: C4_unplugged_madlibs
      ForLoopFun:
        title: For Loop Fun
        desc: We know that loops allow us to do things over and over again, but now

        title: 通过输入参数来作曲。
        desc: 'One of the most magnificent structures in the computer science world
          is the function.  Functions (sometimes called procedures) are mini programs
          that you can use over and over inside of your bigger program. This lesson
          will help students intuitively understand why combining chunks of code into
          functions is such a helpful practice.  '

      BinaryImages:
        title: Binary Images
        desc: Though many people think of binary as strictly zeros and ones, our previous
          courses taught students that information can be represented in a variety
          of binary options.  This lesson takes that concept one step further as it
          illustrates how a computer can store even more complex information (such
          as images and colors) in binary, as well.
