        title: Introduction to Computer Science
        desc: This lesson will introduce the concept of Computer Science and explain what a Computer Scientist does.  It will also give students an opportunity to assume the role of a computer scientist.  By the end of the activity, each student will have a take-home reminder of what he or she learned.  You may be tempted to skip teaching young children the vocabulary words that are associated with the lessons that follow, but presenting them in a fun and playful light now is far more productive than waiting for more advanced opportunities.

        title: Computational Thinking
        desc: With nothing but paper and markers, students will learn the four steps of computational thinking. After a brief introduction, students should be split into groups where they will have to create directions for other students to draw a specific monster (from a catalog of pre-selected monsters). The entire task must be decomposed, then teams will analyze all monsters in the catalog for patterns, abstract different details from the monsters, then use that information to create an algorithm (directions) for another team to draw a certain monster. Teams will then switch algorithms with another group and draw the monster based on what that algorithm indicates. Is the drawing what the original team intended?

        title: Graph Paper Programming
        desc: By programming one another to draw pictures, students will begin to understand what programming is really about. The class will begin by students instructing each other to color squares on graph paper in an effort to reproduce an existing picture.  If there's time, the lesson can conclude with images that the students create themselves.

        title: Algorithms
        desc: This lesson covers algorithms.  Using tangram shapes and graph paper, the first exercise will show how important it is to make each instruction as clear and unambiguous as possible.  Afterward, the class will explore how many ways you can fold paper into a rectangle, noting how some methods can take more or fewer folds than others.

        title: Functions
        desc: In this lesson, students will make a suncatcher out of string, beads, and a special charm. The students will follow a series of repetitive steps, then be asked to identify certain sets of "skills" that are duplicated several times. Once those skills are defined, they will be called from a main program and the whole beautiful process of creation will be recorded on a single sheet of paper. The final program will be geared toward the entire class, whatever their type of string, beads, and charms. To effectively allow for this, students will need to "abstract out" the details of their specific materials and create vague terms for an individual's supplies.  This use of generic placeholders is a wonderful introduction to variables.

      CollisionDetection:
        title: Collision Detection and the Pythagorean Theorem
        desc: Determining when objects on the screen touch is an important aspect of most games.

In Swipe Right for CS, you will read through some student profiles and consider specific statements that you might use to convince him or her to enroll in your CS Principles course. \r\n\r\n## How it Works\r\nWhen playing the Swipe Right for CS game you will see a series of quotes that you might say to each student. You will swipe right on quotes that you think would be effective in convincing that particular student to enroll in the course and swipe left on statements that you think will not be effective. During the session we will discuss as a group your thoughts on the types of statements that are most effective in getting a student to enroll in CS, and you will have a chance to see how other people in your workshop swiped on each of the arguments.\r\n<br><br><br><br>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"display:none\">submitButton next-stage</span>\r\n\r\n<a class=\"btn btn-large btn-primary submitButton\" href=\"https://swipe-right-for-cs.teachingsystemslab.org/start?cuid=<user_id/>\"> Click here to play Swipe Right for CS!</a>\r\n\r\n"
