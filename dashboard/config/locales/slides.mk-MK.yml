    maze_intro:
      1:
        image: notes/hoc1_1.jpg
        text: Welcome to your first hour of code! Let's dive right into your first
          taste of programming.
      2:
        image: notes/hoc1_2.jpg
        text: We'll be using Blockly, a visual programming language where you drag
          and drop blocks to write code.
      3:
        image: notes/hoc1_3.jpg
        text: Most code is typed, but Blockly is visual. Each blocks corresponds to
          a line of "real" code.
      4:
        image: notes/hoc1_4.jpg
        text: You'll learn the foundations of computer science, concepts which are
          used anywhere from making apps to controlling the Mars rover.
      5:
        image: notes/hoc1_5.jpg
        text: A program is a set of instructions for your computer to follow.
      6:
        image: notes/hoc1_6.jpg
        text: The goal of your first program is to get an Angry Bird through a maze
          to hit a Green Pig.
      7:
        image: notes/hoc1_7.jpg
        text: The left side is the maze where your program is run. The instructions
          for each puzzle are below the maze.
      8:
        image: notes/hoc1_8.jpg
        text: The middle toolbox has the commands for the Angry Bird. You'll use these
          to build your code.
      9:
        image: notes/hoc1_9.jpg
        text: On the right is your workspace where you'll drag blocks from the toolbox
          to build your program. To delete a block, drag it to the trash in the corner.
      10:
        image: notes/hoc1_10.jpg
        text: Each block is one instruction. If you drag a "move forward" block to
          your workspace and press "Run Program", the bird moves one space on the
          maze.
      11:
        image: notes/hoc1_11.jpg
        text: To do more than one action, you can drag many blocks to your workspace
          and attach them together. The bird will do the commands from top to bottom.
      12:
        image: notes/hoc1_12.jpg
        text: If you run a program and want to fix it and try again, press the "Reset"
          button.
      13:
        image: notes/hoc1_13.jpg
        text: Let's go get those pigs!
    artist_intro:
      1:
        image: notes/stage5_1.jpg
        text: Hi, I'm JR! Every race car team need computer scientists to win. They
          analyze data from the car to make it go faster.
      2:
        image: notes/stage5_2.jpg
        text: In these puzzles, you'll be an artist that draws a line behind them
          everywhere they go.
      3:
        image: notes/stage5_3.jpg
        text: This block says "move forward by 100 pixels." Pixels are just really
          tiny dots on your screen.
      4:
        image: notes/stage5_4.jpg
        text: This block says "turn right by 90 degrees." This will turn your artist
          the same amount as the "turn" blocks in the maze puzzles.
      5:
        image: notes/stage5_5.jpg
        text: Click on the arrow in either of these blocks to change the amount the
          artist moves forward or turns. Play around to get familiar with these new
          blocks.
    farmer_intro:
      1:
        image: notes/stage9_1.jpg
        text: Hi, I'm Paola! In these puzzles, you're a farmer who has to get her
          field completely flat to start planting crops.
      2:
        image: notes/stage9_2.jpg
        text: You have to help her remove all the piles of dirt and fill in all the
          holes.
      3:
        image: notes/stage9_3.jpg
        text: The new blocks remove 1 shovelful of dirt from a pile and fill in 1
          shovelful of dirt to a hole.
      4:
        image: notes/stage9_4.jpg
        text: The piles and holes are different sizes, so you have to tell the farmer
          how many shovelfuls to use.
    flappy_intro:
      1:
        image: notes/flappy01.jpg
        text: Hi, I'm Katie! One of the most exciting things about computer science
          is that a computer program can be interactive.
      2:
        image: notes/flappy02.jpg
        text: Any time somebody clicks or taps or types on a computer or phone, that
          generates an EVENT, and there's some code that decides what to do when an
          EVENT occurs.
      3:
        image: notes/flappy03.jpg
        text: 'For example, you could have an EVENT-HANDLER that says "when the mouse
          is clicked, play a sound" '
      4:
        image: notes/flappy04.jpg
        text: Have you ever heard of the game FlappyBird? By using Event handlers,
          we're going to learn to program our own custom version of FlappyBird!
      5:
        image: notes/flappy05.jpg
        text: The code you'll write involves dragging and dropping blocks that represent
          commands for the computer. Under the hood, each of these blocks is represented
          by real code.
      6:
        image: notes/flappy06.jpg
        text: 'If you take a look at the workspace, there are some green blocks that
          are filled in for you - these are "event handlers" '
      7:
        image: notes/flappy07.jpg
        text: If you want the bird to FLAP when you CLICK the mouse, you can do that
          by attaching the "FLAP" block to the appropriate event handler, and now
          in your game whenever you click the mouse, the bird will flap.
      8:
        image: notes/flappy08.jpg
        text: In each puzzle of this activity we'll introduce new types of events
          as green blocks on the workspace, and you can decide the appropriate blocks
          to add in response to those events.
      9:
        image: notes/flappy09.jpg
        text: When you see a drop down arrow like this, that means you can change
          the settings - like what sound to play when flappy hits the ground.
      10:
        image: notes/flappy10.jpg
        text: In the final puzzle you'll be able to create your own game and share
          it with your friends. Have fun!
    loop_times:
      1:
        image: notes/hoc2_1.jpg
        text: Hi, I'm Mark! Let's learn about loops. Using loops you can tell a computer
          to repeat any set of actions over and over, thousands or even billions of
          times.
      2:
        image: notes/hoc2_2.jpg
        text: In this puzzle, we want to make the bird move forward 5 spaces to get
          to the pig.
      3:
        image: notes/hoc2_3.jpg
        text: We can use the new "repeat" block to help us out.
      4:
        image: notes/hoc2_4.jpg
        text: Instead of dragging out 5 "move forward" blocks...
      5:
        image: notes/hoc2_5.jpg
        text: We can put the "move forward" block inside the "repeat" block and write
          a number in the block to tell it how many times to repeat.
      6:
        image: notes/hoc2_6.jpg
        text: 'And this is important: you can put more than one command inside a "repeat"
          block.'
      7:
        image: notes/hoc2_7.jpg
        text: Enjoy using your new "repeat" block!
    loop_until:
      1:
        image: notes/hoc3_1.jpg
        text: Hi, I'm Chris. Before joining the Miami Heat, I went to Georgia Tech
          to study Computer Science. Let's try our new block, the "repeat until" block.
      2:
        image: notes/hoc3_2.jpg
        text: What if we didn't know how far the bird had to move to get to the pig?
      3:
        image: notes/hoc3_3.jpg
        text: If we put a "move forward" block inside the "repeat until" block, the
          bird will move forward UNTIL it reaches the pig (or crashes into a wall).
      4:
        image: notes/hoc3_4.jpg
        text: 'And this is important: just like before, we can put multiple blocks
          inside the "repeat until" block, and they will all be repeated.'
    if:
      1:
        image: notes/hoc4_1.jpg
        text: 'Hi, I''m Bill! Let''s learn a new fundamental concept: "If" statements.
          This is how computers make decisions.'
      2:
        image: notes/hoc4_2.jpg
        text: You use "If" statements yourself everday. Before you go outside each
          morning, you say IF it's raining outside, I need to wear my jacket.
      3:
        image: notes/hoc4_3.jpg
        text: We can tell the zombie to check IF there's path to the left, and if
          he finds a path to the left, we can have him turn in that direction.
      4:
        image: notes/hoc4_4.jpg
        text: To write the code for this, let's drag out our "if" block and put a
          "turn left" block inside it.
      5:
        image: notes/hoc4_5.jpg
        text: Now, if we put a "move forward" block above it and a "repeat" block
          around everything, each time the zombie moves, he'll check if there's a
          path to the left and turn. The "repeat" command is critical, to check for
          a turn at every step.
      6:
        image: notes/hoc4_6.jpg
        text: If statements are really important in computer science. One of the first
          programs I wrote was a tic-tac-toe game, and there was a If statement that
          said IF the other person is about to win, block the spot that lets them
          win.
      7:
        image: notes/hoc4_7.jpg
        text: Have fun using the "if" block!
    if_else:
      1:
        image: notes/hoc5_1.jpg
        text: Hi, my name is Saloni. I use computer science to help solve problems
          in health and medicine. Let's learn about the "if else" block. It looks
          like the "if" block, but it has an extra part at the end that says "else".
      2:
        image: notes/hoc5_2.jpg
        text: If I put a "move forward" block in the spot where it says "do" and a
          "turn left" block where it says "else" that means that the zombie will choose
          between 2 options. IF there is a path ahead, the zombie will move forward,
          and OTHERWISE (there isn't a path ahead), the zombie will turn left.
      3:
        image: notes/hoc5_3.jpg
        text: Just like the "if" block, we can put "if else" blocks inside a "repeat"
          blocks so that the zombie keeps moving and the "if else" block will keep
          checking if there's somewhere to turn.
      4:
        image: notes/hoc5_4.jpg
        text: Now, get those zombies where they belong!
    if_else_scrat:
      1:
        image: notes/saloni_ifelse_scrat1.jpg
        text: An if-else statement is a decision between two things. Let's see how
          we can use an if-else statement with our buddy Scrat the squirrel.
      2:
        image: notes/saloni_ifelse_scrat2.jpg
        text: This block looks the same as the "if" block, but there's an extra part
          at the bottom that says "else". If I put a "move forward" block where it
          says "do" and a "turn left" block where it says "else", that means Scrat
          the squirrel will move forward if there's a path ahead. If there's not a
          path ahead, Scrat will turn left.
      3:
        image: notes/saloni_ifelse_scrat3.jpg
        text: It's making a decision and doing one of the two actions based on that
          decision. And just like "if" blocks, you can put "if-else" blocks inside
          "repeat" blocks.
      4:
        image: notes/saloni_ifelse_scrat4.jpg
        text: Now let's help Scrat the squirrel get that acorn!
    function:
      1:
        image: notes/stage13_1.jpg
        text: Hi, I'm Brina, an engineer at Instagram. A function is certain lines
          of code that you want to use over and over again, so instead of writing
          that code out everytime, you can just use one block.
      2:
        image: notes/stage13_2.jpg
        text: We're going to learn how to define functions. Function definitions have
          a star in the corner. The name of the function is written on the top line.
      3:
        image: notes/stage13_3.jpg
        text: The blocks that go inside the definition tell us what it does. So this
          function definition is called "fill 5" and it's made up of a "repeat" block
          and a "fill" block.
      4:
        image: notes/stage13_4.jpg
        text: The definition sits on the workspace, but our farmer won't run the function
          until we drag out our "fill 5" function block from functions category.
      5:
        image: notes/stage13_5.jpg
        text: 'Let''s put the "fun" back in "FUNction!" '
    loop_while:
      1:
        image: notes/stage9_5.jpg
        text: 'Hi, I''m Makinde! Let''s learn about the "while block." '
      2:
        image: notes/stage9_6.jpg
        text: The "while block" will do whatever you put inside it AS LONG AS the
          statement on the top is TRUE.
      3:
        image: notes/stage9_7.jpg
        text: For example, if the farmer is standing on a pile, she will continue
          to remove 1 shovelful WHILE there is still a pile beneath her.
    loop_for:
      1:
        image: notes/stage11_1.jpg
        text: Hi, I'm Trina, and I work for Pixar. I've worked on a bunch of movies,
          including Shrek.
      2:
        image: notes/stage11_2.jpg
        text: This is our new "counter" loop. It will perform actions over and over
          again and you can make the actions change slightly each time.
      3:
        image: notes/stage11_3.jpg
        text: In this example, our "counter" loop says "count with counter from 50
          to 90 by 10" and inside it, we have our "draw a square" block. Drag the
          "counter" block from the "Variables" section into the "length" spot.
      4:
        image: notes/stage11_4.jpg
        text: This means our artist is going to draw a square that has 50 pixel length
          sides, then it will add 10 to that and draw a square with 60 pixel length
          sides. Then it will keep adding 10 and drawing squares until it reaches
          90. So we'll have squares of 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90.
    parameters:
      1:
        image: notes/stage15_1.jpg
        text: Hi, I'm Janete, and I'm an engineer at Zynga.
      2:
        image: notes/stage15_2.jpg
        text: What if we want to draw a bunch of triangles and have their lengths
          be different sizes?
      3:
        image: notes/stage15_3.jpg
        text: We could write all that code out by hand or we can use a function with
          parameters.
      4:
        image: notes/stage15_4.jpg
        text: To do this, click the blue star on the "draw a triangle" function definition.
          Then drag "input name" into the "input" block.
      5:
        image: notes/stage15_5.jpg
        text: Then if you write "length" in the spot where it says "x" and press "Enter"
          you'll create a length input for your function.
      6:
        image: notes/stage15_6.jpg
        text: Then click on the star. Now, you want to click on the variables category
          and drag the "length" block into the "move forward" block of your function
          definition. And drag away the old number block.
      7:
        image: notes/stage15_7.jpg
        text: To use your function with parameters, click on the functions category
          and drag out your "draw a triangle with length" function.
      8:
        image: notes/stage15_8.jpg
        text: Now you can use the math block to input different numbers to draw triangles
          of different sizes.
    hoc_wrapup:
      1:
        image: notes/hoc6_1.jpg
        text: Congratulations! With the last puzzle you solved, you just wrote code
          that can tell ANY robot how to find it's way through a non-branching maze
          or tunnel of any length, whether it's a zombie, a bird, a mars rover, or
          even a self-driving car.
      2:
        image: notes/hoc6_2.jpg
        text: The basic concepts you used are at the heart of every program or app
          you'll ever try.  We learned about repeat loops, repeat until statements,
          if statements, and if else statements.
      3:

        text: If you liked your first hour of code, visit code.org to continue your
          education into computer science! Once you complete our 20 hour course, you'll
          have mastered the basics of programming, and can start learning how to write
          phone apps, robot instructions, games, you name it.
      4:

    frozen_intro:
      1:
        image: notes/frozen1_1.jpg
        text: Hi, my name is Lyndsey. I model, act, and write my own apps. Let's use
          code to join Anna and Elsa as they explore the magic and beauty of ice.
      2:
        image: notes/frozen1_2.jpg
        text: You'll create snowflakes and patterns as you ice skate and make a winter
          wonderland that you can then share with your friends.
      3:
        image: notes/frozen1_3.jpg
        text: In the next hour, you're going to learn the basics of how to code. Traditional
          programming is usually in text, but we'll use Blockly, which uses visual
          blocks that you can drag and drop to write programs. This is how even university
          students learn the basics. Under the hood, you're still creating code.
      4:
        image: notes/frozen1_4.jpg
        text: A program is a set of instructions that tells a computer what to do.
          Let's build a code, or a program, that will help Elsa create a simple line.
          We will use this later to create more complex patterns.
      5:
        image: notes/frozen1_5.jpg
        text: Your screen is split into three main parts. On the left, is the ice
          surface where you'll run your program. The instructions for each level are
          written right below the surface.
      6:
        image: notes/frozen1_6.jpg
        text: This middle area is the toolbox, and each of these blocks is an action
          that Elsa and Anna can do.
      7:
        image: notes/frozen1_7.jpg
        text: The white space on the right is called the workspace, and this is where
          we'll build our program. To move around the ice surface, you'll use the
          "Move Forward" block.
      8:
        image: notes/frozen1_8.jpg
        text: Here, the "Move Forward" block says, "move forward by 100 pixels." When
          we press "Run", what happens? Elsa moves forward a certain amount on the
          screen, 100 pixels in fact! Pixels are basically very tiny squares on your
          computer screen.
      9:
        image: notes/frozen1_9.jpg
        text: The other block we have in this puzzle says "turn right by 90 degrees."
          And when we use this "Turn Right" block, that makes Elsa turn a certain
          amount. You can play around with how far you want Elsa to turn. The angle
          is measured from the path ahead of Elsa. So, this is a 90 degree turn. And
          this is a 120 degree turn.

          count to 10, 20, or 100. But a computer can count to a billion or a trillion.
          It won't get bored and it will only take a few seconds. Whether it's counting,
          or drawing, or anything--computers can repeat things hundreds or even billions

          "Turn Right by 90 degrees" once, and then tell it to repeat this pair of
          actions 4 times. To do that, you need to put the "Move Forward" and "Turn
          Right" block inside a "Repeat" block.

        text: Today we're going to learn about Pair Programming. In pair programming
          you work as a team. Why should two people use one computer? Because two
          heads are better than one. In pair programming you and your partner are
          going to sit down together at one computer and you are both going to work
          on the same project.
      2:
        image: notes/C1_pair_programming_2.png
        text: In pair programming, one person is the driver and the other person is
          the navigator, just like driving a car. The driver sits at the computer
          and is the one using the keyboard and mouse or touchscreen and controlling
          the main actions of the computer. The other person is the navigator. The
          navigator helps the driver by answering the driver's questions and pointing
          out potential problems or mistakes.
      3:
        image: notes/C1_pair_programming_3.png
        text: Communication is key to successful pair programming. No insults, be
          respectful, don't be a bossy navigator, because nobody likes a backseat
          driver. You and your partner should always be talking. The driver can explain
          what she or he is doing. And the navigator can help suggest what to do next.
      4:
        image: notes/C1_pair_programming_4.png
        text: The navigator should be thinking about the big picture and the driver
          focuses on the details. Both roles are important. Pair programming is all
          about working together as a team.

        text: This lesson is called planting a seed and it's going to help us understand
          algorithms. Algorithms are specific instructions that explain the order
          in which to do something. Even everyday things like eating breakfast or
          brushing your teeth are algorithms that require small steps to get a job
          done.
      2:
        image: notes/C1_planting_seed_2.png
        text: Computers can be really smart but they can only understand you if you
          tell them exactly what you want step by step. The great thing about algorithms
          is that if you follow the instructions in order, you can do something that
          you didn't know how to do ahead of time. It's like following a recipe.
      3:

          order.
      4:
        image: notes/C1_planting_seed_4.png
        text: Now, it's time for you to see if your algorithm works. Follow the steps
          in the algorithm very carefully. Are they in the correct order? Did you
          succeed in planting a seed by following the algorithm? It's like programming
          with pictures!

        text: When we want to make chocolate, there are many big steps to that process
          and each of those big steps has a set of smaller steps and there are different
          recipes or algorithms depending on how we want the chocolate to taste. Each
          step is important, even the small ones, so that without one step, the rest
          of them cannot be completed. Creating algorithms that others can understand
          is really important. That's why each step has to be written down so that
          no matter who does it, the result is the same.

          pig. Now, we're going to be able to use the repeat block in order to be
          able to do this very easily. You can either do this by giving the computer
          a move forward command five times in order to advance the bird one step
          each time to the pig or you can just tell the computer to move forward once,
          and then tell it to repeat that five times and it'll do the same thing.
      4:
        image: notes/C1_zuck_repeat_loop_4.png
        text: In order to do this, you drag your move forward command and then you
          put it inside the repeat block. And you can click on it and tell it how
          many times you  to repeat the block to tell it how many steps you want it
          to take forward.
      5:
        image: notes/C1_zuck_repeat_loop_5.png
        text: One more thing is you can put as many commands as you want inside the

          are LEDs and those are lights that are either on or off. It's a binary system,
          one or the other. We can use the lights to represent binary numbers. If
          we have a set of robots, we can say that the first robot is the 1s place
          and the second robot is the 2s place, the third robot is the 4s place and
          so on. That's how you represent a binary number. The robots will do it with
          their binary eyes and count it out for you.

        text: To loop those blocks four times to draw the whole square, we just drag
          out the repeat block and put the moveforward and turn right blocks inside
          the repeat block. When we hit run, the artist will repeat those steps four
          times to complete the square.

        text: A loop is a repetition of activity. Going into a hive to inspect, I
          look at a frame, and then I put it back. I repeat that same activity multiple
          times. It's looping around, doing the same activity multiple times.
      2:
        image: notes/C2_bee_loops_2.png
        text: This is the repeat block. Whatever you put inside the repeat block will
          repeat those actions the number of times that you tell it to. For example,
          in this level, rather than drag out move forward and get nectar three times,
          we're going to just drag them out once each and repeat the action three
          times. That made it easy!

          visual blocks that you drag and drop to write programs. Under the hood,
          you're still creating code. To start off, we're going to build code for
          a program that will help this Angry Bird move through a maze to get to the
          evil pigs that stole its eggs.

        text: Blockly is split into three main parts. On the left is the bird's maze,
          where your program will run. The instructions for each level are written
          below the maze. This middle area is the toolbox and each of these blocks
          is a command that the bird can understand. The white space on the right
          is called the workspace and this is where we'll build our program.

          The bird moves forward one box on the grid. And what if I want the bird
          to do something after it moves forward one box? I can add another block
          to our program.

          move block until the yellow arrow appears. Then I'll drop it and the two
          blocks will snap together. When I press "Run" again,  the bird will perform
          the commands that are stacked from top to bottom on our work space.

          But first, we need to break this big project into easy to follow small steps.
          For making a paper airplane, we need to decide what steps to take and in
          what order to take them.

          you'll select the 6 pictures that show the steps needed to make a paper
          airplane and arrange those pictures in the correct order. After you have
          everything in order, you will trade algorithms with another student team
          to test out the algorithm to see if the algorithm works. A well designed
          algorithm is super important to making the best paper airplane.

          And each of those big steps has its own set of smaller steps. And there
          are different recipes, or algorithms, depending on how we want the chocolate
          to taste. Each step is important, even the small ones. So without one step,
          the rest of them cannot be completed. Creating algorithms that others can
          understand is really important. That's why each step has to be written down,
          so no matter who does it, the result is the same.

          times in a row. But a computer can do the same thing millions or even billions
          of times, and not get bored and be able to carry that out really well.

          write out all of those emails to everyone. But with just a few lines of
          code, I can have a system send an email to everyone on Facebook wishing
          them a happy birthday. So that's what loops are, and why they're valuable,
          and something that computers can do very well.

        text: In this example your goal is going to be to move the bird to get the
          pig.  Now we're gonna be able to use the "repeat" block in order to be able
          to do this very easily. You can either do this by giving the computer a
          "move forward" command five times in order to advance the bird one step
          each time to the pig.
      4:
        image: notes/C2_zuck_repeat_loop_4.png
        text: Or you can just tell the computer to "move forward" once, and then tell
          it to "repeat" that 5 times, and it will do the same thing. So in order
          to do this you drag your "move forward" command, and then you put it inside
          the "repeat" block.And you can click on it and tell it how many times you
          want to repeat the block to tell it how many steps you want it to take forward.
      5:
        image: notes/C2_zuck_repeat_loop_5.png
        text: Now one more thing is you can put as many commands as you want inside
          the "repeat" block. So in this example you're telling it to move forward
          and turn left, which it will do five times. All right good job and have

          square, so that any time we want to do that, we simply say draw a square
          and it will go back and invoke that function, that code. It will get done
          for us. We've added that concept to our programming language.

        text: The other block we have in this puzzle says turn right by 90 degrees.
          And when we drag that out that makes our artist turn a certain amount. So
          you can play around with how far you want the artist to turn. This is a
          90 degree turn.

          learned these really basic moves, you learn new moves and put together these
          building blocks, like a pick and roll or give and go. You can then go from
          there to do more complex plays. Once you learn that play and give it a name,

          After the programmer is sure the steps are correct, it's time to translate
          the algorithm into a program with language that the computer can understand.

          you can follow to finish a task. Think about getting ready for school or
          planning a fun day with your friends or fixing a snack. To complete any
          of those tasks, you'll need to break it down into smaller steps and sometimes
          the steps must be in a specific order.

          is the actual instructions given to the computer to make it happen. An algorithm
          has to be translated into a program before a computer can run it. Breaking
          a task into steps called an algorithm is sometimes difficult. But like any

          These small parts are called packets. Each packet of the message is delivered
          to the destination one at a time. These packets are all put together in
          the right order so that the receiver can read the message correctly. Of
          course, there are many more things to learn about how the internet works
          but this is a great start. You're on your way to becoming a savvy internet

          In my job, we think a lot about how contacts can be sent to other devices,
          such as your phone. Most people have a lot of contacts, you might have say,
          1000 contacts and we don't want to send all of those contacts at once to
          your phone because it's too large of a message. Similar to the way the internet
          breaks large messages down into packets, we use a concept called paging
          where we might only send your phone 100 contacts at a time and let your
          phone respond to us and ask for the next 100.

          now there's a new part at the bottom that says else. The if/else block lets
          the bee make a decision between two sets of actions. If the bee is at a
          flower, the bee will do the set of actions you put in the first part where
          it says do. If the bee is not at a flower, the bee will do the set of actions

          The top of our if/else block says if at flower. But the top of our block
          could say other things, like if nectar equals 2 or if there's a path ahead,
          our block will behave in the same way. That if the statement at the top
          is true it will do the first set of actions. But if the statement at the

          next to length because the function wants to know what value the parameter
          Length should have. Drag a number block from the Math category and place
          it in this space. See how you can use the function again and again with
          different lengths to make squares of different sizes? Try it for yourself!

          visual blocks that you drag and drop to write programs. Under the hood,
          you're still creating code. To start off, we're going to build code for
          a program that will help this Angry Bird move through a maze to get to the
          evil pigs that stole its eggs.

          below the maze. This middle area is the toolbox and each of these blocks
          is a command that the bird can understand. The white space on the right
          is called the workspace and this is where we'll build our program.

          If I just used a variable called height instead, then I could easily change
          height to fifty and then change my algorithm to tell the artist to go up
          by height, turn right and then go over by height times 2, which gives us
          a rectangle that is twice as wide as it is tall.

          If you keep an algorithm simple, there are lots of ways to interpret it
          and whoever performs that algorithm might not get exactly what you wanted.
          If you want to make sure that everyone ends up with the exact same thing,

          for people by me, there is paint by numbers. There are forty colors and
          it has little letters and numbers that tell you which color to paint each

          There's so many different aspects to what's going to be affecting what's

          for name, email address, and even username. That way we can let the program
          know where those details will appear after the user fills them in. We use

          those details. For instance, one monster in the catalog has vegitas eyes
          and another has spritem eyes. But they both have eyes so we can write a

          one plank, then take this command and use the repeat block to have her perform
          the action multiple times. Now we'll click on the repeat block and tell

          that place before moving forward. If there is lava there, we want to place
          a stone in front of our character before we can move forward. That way we
          can safely move on. Time for more mining! And remember to use the if statement

        text: Use the switch on top of your app to go into Design Mode.
      3:

        text: You can add new elements by dragging them onto the screen. You can move
          them around to different locations and change their size by dragging the
          bottom right corner.
      4:
        image: notes/applab_intro_designmode_4.png
        text: To change an element's properties use the controls on the right. For
          example, it's really easy to change this button's text, color, and font
          size.
      5:
        image: notes/applab_intro_designmode_5.png
        text: When you add a new element to your screen it'll get a generic ID like
          button1. It's a good idea to change this button's ID to something more meaningful
          like "rightButton". So that you'll know which one it is when you go to the
          program.
      6:

        text: From the drop-down at the top you can quickly switch back and forth
          between the screens you create.
      9:
        image: notes/applab_intro_designmode_9.png
        text: Inside your app, you'll need a way to switch between all of these screens,
          so the setScreen block has been added to the toolbox. Use "setScreen" inside
          the "onEvent" block to change screens at the click of a button.

        text: In the next few levels you'll be working on a single project. First
          you'll add a button then you'll add a new screen and finally you'll write
          code so that the button switches to the new screen.

          in your path, so you can pick up the items you'll need for your journey.
          Only the Agent can place and break blocks, and only you can collect items.
          Your screen is split into three main parts. On the left is Minecraft.

          inside the repeat block. This tells the computer to do the same thing many
          times in a row without having to drag a whole bunch of blocks into the workspace.
          You can choose how many times to repeat by putting a number in the repeat
          block.

          often ask: "How do computers work?" In this series, you''re going to learn
          how computers really work, starting with what makes a computer a computer.

          working with computers since I was maybe seven years old and now I work
          on virtual reality. As humans, we've always built tools to help us solve
          problems. Tools like a wheelbarrow, a hammer, or a printing press, or a
          tractor-trailer.
      4:
        image: notes/csd_concept_computer_4.png
        text: All of these inventions helped us with manual work. Over time, people
          began to wonder if a machine could be designed and built to help us with
          the thinking work we do, like solving equations or tracking the stars in
          the sky. Rather than moving or manipulating physical things like dirt and
          stone, these machines would need to be designed to manipulate information.
          As the pioneers of computer science explored how to design a thinking machine,
          they realized that it had to perform four different tasks.
      5:

        text: It would need to take input, store information process it and then output
          the results. Now this might sound simple, but these four things are common
          to all computers. That's what makes a computer a computer.
      6:
        image: notes/csd_concept_computer_6.png
        text: Computers started out as basic calculators, which was already really
          awesome at the time, and they were only manipulating numbers back then.
          But now we can use them to talk to each other, we can use them to play games,
          control robots, and do any crazy thing that you could probably imagine.
          Modern computers look nothing like those clunky old machines but they still
          do these same four things.
      7:

        text: First, we're going to talk about input. You can tell computers what
          to do with the keyboard, you can tell them what to do with the mouse, the
          microphone, the camera. All these different inputs give a computer information,
          which is then stored in memory.
      8:
        image: notes/csd_concept_computer_8.png
        text: A computer's processor takes information from memory. It manipulates
          it or changes it using an algorithm, which is just a series of commands.
          And then it sends the processed information back to be stored in memory
          again. This continues until the processed information is ready to be output.
      9:
        image: notes/csd_concept_computer_9.png
        text: How a computer outputs information depends on what the computer is designed
          to do. A computer display can show text, photos, videos, or interactive
          games -- even virtual reality! The output of a computer may even include
          signals to control a robot.

        text: Well, if you have a single wire with electricity flowing through it,
          the signal could either be on or off. That's not a lot of choices, but it's
          a really important start. With one wire, we can represent a yes or no, true
          or false, a one or zero, or anything else with only two options. This on/off
          state of a single wire is called a bit, and it's the smallest piece of information
          a computer can store.

          we only have two digits: zero and one. With these two digits, we can count
          up to any number.'
      8:
        image: notes/csd_concept_binary_data_8.png
        text: Here's how this works. In a decimal number system we're all used to,
          each position in a number has a different value. There's a 1 position, the
          10 position, the 100 position, and so on. For example, a 9 in the 100 position
          is a 900. In binary, each position also carries a value. But instead of
          multiplying by 10 each time, we multiply by 2. So there's the 1 position,
          the 2 position, the 4 position, the 8 position, and so on. For example,
          the number 9 in binary is 1001. To calculate the value, we add 1 times 8,
          plus 0 times 4, plus 0 times 2, plus 1 times 1. Almost nobody does this
          math because computers do it for us. What's important is that any number
          can be represented with only ones and zeros, or by a bunch of wires that
          are on or off. The more wires you use, the larger the numbers you can store.
          With 8 wires, you can store numbers between 0 and 255. That's 8 ones. With
          just 32 wires, you can store all the way from 0 to over 4 billion. Using
          the binary number system, you can represent any number you like.

          Think of all the letters in the alphabet. You could assign a number to each
          letter. A could be 1, B could be 2, and so on. You can then represent any
          word or paragraph as a sequence of numbers. And as we saw, these numbers
          can be stored as on or off electrical signals. Every word you see on every
          webpage or your phone is represented using a system like this.

          into a series of numbers. If you want higher quality sound, you will pick

        text: Let's take a closer look at how circuits can modify and process information
          that's represented in ones and zeros. This is an incredibly simple circuit.
          It takes an electrical signal, on or off, and it flips it. So if the signal
          you give it is a 1, the circuit gives you a 0, and if you give the circuit
          a 0, it gives you a 1. The signal that goes in is not the same as the signal
          that comes out, and so we call this circuit NOT.

          electrical signals, now each one might be a 1 or a 0. If either of the signals
          coming in is a 0, then the result is also a 0. This circuit will only give
          you a 1, if the first signal and the second signal are both a 1, and so
          we call the circuit AND.

          an adder. This circuit takes in 2 individual bits, each one a 1 or a 0,
          and adds them together to calculate the sum. The sum can be 0 plus 0 equals
          0, 0 plus 1 equals 1, or 1 plus 1 equals 2. You need two wires coming out
          because it can take up to two binary digits to represent the sum. Once you
          have a single adder for adding two bits of information, you can put together
          multiples of these adder circuits side-by-side to add together much larger
          numbers.

          and way way faster. Why are smaller computers also faster? Well, because
          the smaller the circuit is, the less distance the electrical signal has
          to go. Electricity moves at just about the speed of light, which is why

          and a 3D printer will print an object. Output devices can also control physical
          motion like a robotic arm, the motor of a car, or the cutting tool of the
          milling machine that my company makes. New types of inputs and outputs let

          to use to do a specific job. For example, an "add" command tells the CPU
          to use its outer circuit to calculate a new number. And then the "store"
          command tells the CPU to use a different circuit to save that result into
          memory.
