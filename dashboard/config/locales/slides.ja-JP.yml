          you touch your screen on a tablet to scroll, that's an event also. Events
          are a great way of letting the user direct your program whenever they need

          the button this frame? Yes or no?" Without events, the player couldn't move,
          you couldn't jump, you wouldn't be able to control what's going on. The

          you want to go loop through these six dancers over and over again and then
          within the loop you want to increase the speed of the light. And that's

          brushing your teeth are algorithms that require small steps to get a job
          done.

        text: Computers can be really smart but they can only understand you if you
          tell them exactly what you want step by step. The great thing about algorithms
          is that if you follow the instructions in order, you can do something that
          you didn't know how to do ahead of time. It's like following a recipe.

        text: Now, it's time for you to see if your algorithm works. Follow the steps
          in the algorithm very carefully. Are they in the correct order? Did you
          succeed in planting a seed by following the algorithm? It's like programming
          with pictures!

        text: When we want to make chocolate, there are many big steps to that process
          and each of those big steps has a set of smaller steps and there are different
          recipes or algorithms depending on how we want the chocolate to taste. Each
          step is important, even the small ones, so that without one step, the rest
          of them cannot be completed. Creating algorithms that others can understand
          is really important. That's why each step has to be written down so that
          no matter who does it, the result is the same.

          you'll select the 6 pictures that show the steps needed to make a paper
          airplane and arrange those pictures in the correct order. After you have
          everything in order, you will trade algorithms with another student team
          to test out the algorithm to see if the algorithm works. A well designed

          And each of those big steps has its own set of smaller steps. And there
          are different recipes, or algorithms, depending on how we want the chocolate
          to taste. Each step is important, even the small ones. So without one step,
          the rest of them cannot be completed. Creating algorithms that others can
          understand is really important. That's why each step has to be written down,
          so no matter who does it, the result is the same.

          code, I can have a system send an email to everyone on Facebook wishing
          them a happy birthday. So that's what loops are, and why they're valuable,

          to do this very easily. You can either do this by giving the computer a
          "move forward" command five times in order to advance the bird one step
          each time to the pig.

          it to "repeat" that 5 times, and it will do the same thing. So in order
          to do this you drag your "move forward" command, and then you put it inside
          the "repeat" block.And you can click on it and tell it how many times you
          want to repeat the block to tell it how many steps you want it to take forward.
      5:

          learned these really basic moves, you learn new moves and put together these
          building blocks, like a pick and roll or give and go. You can then go from
          there to do more complex plays. Once you learn that play and give it a name,

          a step by step plan for solving a problem or finishing a task. In this lesson,
          you'll create an algorithm for a dice race game. Then you'll ask your friends
          to try out your plan to see if they can follow the steps to play the game.
          After the programmer is sure the steps are correct, it's time to translate
          the algorithm into a program with language that the computer can understand.
      3:

          planning a fun day with your friends or fixing a snack. To complete any
          of those tasks, you'll need to break it down into smaller steps and sometimes
          the steps must be in a specific order.

          get out of the cabinet first. But you can't spread the peanut butter until
          you open the jar. Computers need algorithms and programs to show them how
          to do even simple things that we can do without thinking about it.
      5:

        text: An algorithm is the thinking behind what needs to happen while the program
          is the actual instructions given to the computer to make it happen. An algorithm
          has to be translated into a program before a computer can run it. Breaking
          a task into steps called an algorithm is sometimes difficult. But like any
          new skill, it gets easier and easier with practice.

          These small parts are called packets. Each packet of the message is delivered
          to the destination one at a time. These packets are all put together in
          the right order so that the receiver can read the message correctly. Of
          course, there are many more things to learn about how the internet works
          but this is a great start. You're on your way to becoming a savvy internet

          In my job, we think a lot about how contacts can be sent to other devices,
          such as your phone. Most people have a lot of contacts, you might have say,
          1000 contacts and we don't want to send all of those contacts at once to
          your phone because it's too large of a message. Similar to the way the internet
          breaks large messages down into packets, we use a concept called paging
          where we might only send your phone 100 contacts at a time and let your
          phone respond to us and ask for the next 100.

          The top of our if/else block says if at flower. But the top of our block
          could say other things, like if nectar equals 2 or if there's a path ahead,

          If you want to make sure that everyone ends up with the exact same thing,
          then your algorithm will need to be detailed and very specific.

          doing a painting of some wolves but I'm not the most amazing painter. Luckily
          for people by me, there is paint by numbers. There are forty colors and
          it has little letters and numbers that tell you which color to paint each
          section. Paint by numbers tells me exactly what color to use and where.

          There's so many different aspects to what's going to be affecting what's

          for name, email address, and even username. That way we can let the program

          take a big difficult problem and break it down into several simpler problems.
          The goal of this lesson is to write a set of instructions that someone can
          follow to draw one of the monsters included in the lesson plan.

          they'll look for patterns between all the monsters in the catalog. When
          they come across differences between the monsters, they'll abstract or remove
          those details. For instance, one monster in the catalog has vegitas eyes
          and another has spritem eyes. But they both have eyes so we can write a
          line that says the monster has blank eyes.

          their very own monster.

          Like you learned with the if statements in earlier lessons,  during Blockly,
          if statements have a piece about them you have to evaluate to find out if
          it's true or false. That's the conditional and it can be used in lots of

          then we sing through our song and go back and we notice that the class doesn't
          sing the word chorus, they automatically go up to the top where we define
          the chorus and sing through that. We use that as a great introduction to

          have a song like Old Macdonald, where certain words change, that's a great
          place to introduce the idea of parameters. Passing certain words through
          so that you can send extra information to your function. Once we're sure
          everybody gets it, you can take your own familiar songs and break them up
          yourself. See if you can figure it out together.

          own words for their own stories, and really explain the concept of abstraction.

          little that changes and you abstract out that little thing that changes
          and you can fill it in with your own word every time through. But sometimes
          you have three words that change and so you fill those in with three parameters,
          that's still pretty helpful.

          way to handle that one little difference, they could just reuse one function

        text: Making your own apps is easy with App Lab! Whether you're new to coding
          or have some experience. App Lab is a great tool for building new apps and
          sharing them with your friends.
      3:
        image: notes/applab_intro_welcome_3.png
        text: This is a App Lab. On the left side is your app. On the right side is
          the code that will make it run. You build your program by dragging in blocks
          from the toolbox. To start you'll just have one block called 'setProperty'.
      4:
        image: notes/applab_intro_welcome_4.png
        text: The set property block changes the look of the elements on your screen.
          Like the buttons, labels, or even the screen itself. First you need to decide
          which element you want to change. If you hover over an element in your app
          you can see the name or ID here. Then go select that ID from the first drop
          down.
      5:
        image: notes/applab_intro_welcome_5.png
        text: Elements have lots of properties you can change like their text color,
          background color or font size. You can see the full list and choose which
          property you want to change in the second drop down.
      6:
        image: notes/applab_intro_welcome_6.png
        text: The last drop down is where you'll write the value you want to use value
          you want to use. The block will make a suggestion for you. But you can always
          type in different colors or numbers yourself.
      7:
        image: notes/applab_intro_welcome_7.png
        text: Once you're done, the block reads a bit like a sentence:'Set button1's
          background color to green.' Hit run to see the changes you're building in
          code. If you reset you can drag in more blocks to change other things about
          your app. Like the text!
      8:
        image: notes/applab_intro_welcome_8.png
        text: For this tutorial we'll be working in block mode but App Lab also supports
          working in text.
      9:
        image: notes/applab_intro_welcome_9.png
        text: Either way you'll be programming in JavaScript, the language of the
          web. Each level has a goal, instructions and an image of what you're aiming
          to create.
      10:
        image: notes/applab_intro_welcome_10.png
        text: If you're ever stuck, click on this picture and it will show you exactly
          how to complete the level. But see if you can do it on your own first.
      11:
        image: notes/applab_intro_welcome_11.png
        text: Once you've completed the goal for this level click Finish to move on.
          That's all there is to it! Hit the orange "continue" button to go to the
          next level and start your adventure with an App Lab!
    applab_intro_events:
      1:
        image: notes/applab_intro_events_1.png
        text: Apps are really cool because it's kind of like starting your own business
          I mean, you get to design everything from the ground up, you get to manage
          everything, and you're the owner of this piece of work that you just created
          with code.
      2:
        image: notes/applab_intro_events_2.png
        text: Now that you can change the look of your app let's make it interactive
          by responding to events! Events are user actions like clicking a button,
          scrolling through a menu, or hovering over a picture. Interactive apps need
          ways to respond to events, like playing a sound when I click this button.
          To do this in App Lab you need to use a new block called 'onEvent'.
      3:
        image: notes/applab_intro_events_3.png
        text: This program sets the screen to blue. I want the screen to turn green
          when I click this button. First I'll need to drag in an onEvent block. By
          hovering I know the button's ID is "bigButton" so I'll select that in the
          first drop-down.
      4:
        image: notes/applab_intro_events_4.png
        text: Next I'll choose the type of event. There's lots of options you can
          pick from but right now I'll leave it as a regular old click.
      5:
        image: notes/applab_intro_events_5.png
        text: 'Finally I''ll add code inside the on event that will change the background
          color of the screen. You can read this block like a sentence: "On the event
          that the button is clicked run all this code."'
      6:
        image: notes/applab_intro_events_6.png
        text: Let's test it. Blocks outside an onEvent still run right away so the
          screen starts blue.
      7:
        image: notes/applab_intro_events_7.png
        text: And when I click the big button the code inside my onEvent runs and
          my screen turns green.
      8:
        image: notes/applab_intro_events_8.png
        text: If you want to change more things after the event, like the text on
          the screen just add more code to the onEvent
      9:
        image: notes/applab_intro_events_9.png
        text: To make your program respond to more events add more onEvent blocks.
          Just make sure not to put them inside of each other. Now it's time to try
          it out for yourself. Have fun!
    applab_intro_sounds:
      1:
        image: notes/applab_intro_sounds_1.png
        text: Next you'll learn about adding images and sounds to your app. Let's
          start by checking out the sound options.
      2:
        image: notes/applab_intro_sounds_2.png
        text: In the tool box you'll find a new block called "playSound". Drag it
          into the workspace. You can pick a sound to play by clicking the drop-down
          then clicking "Choose".
      3:
        image: notes/applab_intro_sounds_3.png
        text: From here you can either upload a sound file from your computer, or
          search for a sound from the sound library. The sound library has lots of
          different categories like instruments, background music or animals.
      4:
        image: notes/applab_intro_sounds_4.png
        text: Once you've got the sound you want, click "Choose". When this block
          runs, it will play the sound you chose.
      5:
        image: notes/applab_intro_sounds_5.png
        text: To add images to your elements you can just use the setProperty block.
          Select the image property in the second drop-down
      6:
        image: notes/applab_intro_sounds_6.png
        text: Then select "Choose" from the third drop down.
      7:
        image: notes/applab_intro_sounds_7.png
        text: From here you can upload an image from your computer or you can look
          through a huge library of icons in the icon library.
      8:
        image: notes/applab_intro_sounds_8.png
        text: Back in code mode you can use the "setProperty" block to change the
          icon color of your icon. Once you've picked what image your icon to use
          click "Run" to see how it looks.
      9:
        image: notes/applab_intro_sounds_9.png
        text: That's all there is to it! Now you can start adding images and sounds
          to make your apps even more fun and dynamic.
    applab_intro_designmode:
      1:
        image: notes/applab_intro_designmode_1.png
        text: To build your own apps you're going to need to start designing screens
          and elements from scratch. App Lab makes this easy to do with Design Mode.
      2:
        image: notes/applab_intro_designmode_2.png
        text: Use the switch on top of your app to go into Design Mode.
      3:
        image: notes/applab_intro_designmode_3.png
        text: You can add new elements by dragging them onto the screen. You can move
          them around to different locations and change their size by dragging the
          bottom right corner.
      4:
        image: notes/applab_intro_designmode_4.png
        text: To change an element's properties use the controls on the right. For
          example, it's really easy to change this button's text, color, and font
          size.
      5:
        image: notes/applab_intro_designmode_5.png
        text: When you add a new element to your screen it'll get a generic ID like
          button1. It's a good idea to change this button's ID to something more meaningful
          like "rightButton". So that you'll know which one it is when you go to the
          program.
      6:
        image: notes/applab_intro_designmode_6.png
        text: If you add an element to your app by mistake, just drag it out or hit
          the delete.
      7:
        image: notes/applab_intro_designmode_7.png
        text: You can add entirely new screens to your app by dragging in a screen
          element
      8:
        image: notes/applab_intro_designmode_8.png
        text: From the drop-down at the top you can quickly switch back and forth
          between the screens you create.
      9:
        image: notes/applab_intro_designmode_9.png
        text: Inside your app, you'll need a way to switch between all of these screens,
          so the setScreen block has been added to the toolbox. Use "setScreen" inside
          the "onEvent" block to change screens at the click of a button.
      10:
        image: notes/applab_intro_designmode_10.png
        text: In the next few levels you'll be working on a single project. First
          you'll add a button then you'll add a new screen and finally you'll write
          code so that the button switches to the new screen.
    applab_intro_share:

        text: Now that you've learned some of the basics of App Lab like adding buttons,
          sounds, images, text and new screens you can make all sorts of apps.
      2:
        image: notes/applab_intro_share_2.png
        text: In the next level you'll find the app you just finished building. With
          a little creativity, you can turn this into a personality quiz for your
          friends, a greeting card that you can share with your family or a choose-your-own-adventure
          game. All of these apps are just a combination of the skills you've already
          learned, and I bet you can come up with even more.
      3:
        image: notes/applab_intro_share_3.png
        text: Once you're done with your app you can easily send it to your phone

          in your path, so you can pick up the items you'll need for your journey.
          Only the Agent can place and break blocks, and only you can collect items.
          Your screen is split into three main parts. On the left is Minecraft.

          the signal could either be on or off. That's not a lot of choices, but it's
          a really important start. With one wire, we can represent a yes or no, true
          or false, a one or zero, or anything else with only two options. This on/off
          state of a single wire is called a bit, and it's the smallest piece of information
          a computer can store.

          up to any number.'
      8:
        image: notes/csd_concept_binary_data_8.png
        text: Here's how this works. In a decimal number system we're all used to,
          each position in a number has a different value. There's a 1 position, the
          10 position, the 100 position, and so on. For example, a 9 in the 100 position
          is a 900. In binary, each position also carries a value. But instead of
          multiplying by 10 each time, we multiply by 2. So there's the 1 position,
          the 2 position, the 4 position, the 8 position, and so on. For example,
          the number 9 in binary is 1001. To calculate the value, we add 1 times 8,
          plus 0 times 4, plus 0 times 2, plus 1 times 1. Almost nobody does this
          math because computers do it for us. What's important is that any number
          can be represented with only ones and zeros, or by a bunch of wires that
          are on or off. The more wires you use, the larger the numbers you can store.
          With 8 wires, you can store numbers between 0 and 255. That's 8 ones. With
          just 32 wires, you can store all the way from 0 to over 4 billion. Using
          the binary number system, you can represent any number you like.

          Think of all the letters in the alphabet. You could assign a number to each
          letter. A could be 1, B could be 2, and so on. You can then represent any
          word or paragraph as a sequence of numbers. And as we saw, these numbers
          can be stored as on or off electrical signals. Every word you see on every
          webpage or your phone is represented using a system like this.

          into a series of numbers. If you want higher quality sound, you will pick

          components, which come together to form circuits.
      4:

        text: Let's take a closer look at how circuits can modify and process information
          that's represented in ones and zeros. This is an incredibly simple circuit.
          It takes an electrical signal, on or off, and it flips it. So if the signal
          you give it is a 1, the circuit gives you a 0, and if you give the circuit
          a 0, it gives you a 1. The signal that goes in is not the same as the signal
          that comes out, and so we call this circuit NOT.

        text: More complicated circuits can take multiple signals and combine them,
          and give you a different result. In this example, a circuit will take two
          electrical signals, now each one might be a 1 or a 0. If either of the signals
          coming in is a 0, then the result is also a 0. This circuit will only give
          you a 1, if the first signal and the second signal are both a 1, and so
          we call the circuit AND.

          an adder. This circuit takes in 2 individual bits, each one a 1 or a 0,
          and adds them together to calculate the sum. The sum can be 0 plus 0 equals
          0, 0 plus 1 equals 1, or 1 plus 1 equals 2. You need two wires coming out
          because it can take up to two binary digits to represent the sum. Once you
          have a single adder for adding two bits of information, you can put together
          multiples of these adder circuits side-by-side to add together much larger
          numbers.

          number is represented using 8 bits, resulting in 16 different electrical

          of little adders inside of it, which together, calculate the sum.

          like subtraction or multiplication. In fact, all the information processing
          your computer does is just lots and lots of small simple operations put
          together. Each individual operation done by a computer is so, so simple
          it could be done by a human, but these circuits inside computers are way
          way faster.

          and way way faster. Why are smaller computers also faster? Well, because
          the smaller the circuit is, the less distance the electrical signal has
          to go. Electricity moves at just about the speed of light, which is why
          modern circuits can perform billions of calculations per second.

          a drone are also different input devices.

        text: Now, let's look at a simple example of how input travels through a computer
          and becomes output. When you press a key on your keyboard - let's say the
          letter "B". The keyboard converts the letter to a number. That number is
          sent as binary, ones and zeros, into the computer.
      7:

        text: Starting from this number, the CPU calculates how to display the letter
          "B" pixel by pixel. The CPU requests step-by-step instructions from memory,
          which tell it how to draw the letter "B". The CPU runs these instructions
          and stores the results as pixels in memory.

        text: Finally, this pixel information is sent in binary to the screen. The
          screen is an output device, which converts the binary signals into the tiny
          lights and colors that make up what you see.

        text: This all happens so quickly it feels instantaneous, but to display each
          letter a computer runs thousands of instructions, starting from the moment
          your finger presses the key point.
      10:
        image: notes/csd_concept_memory_cpu_input_output_10.png
        text: In that example, the output device was the screen, but there are many
          different types of output which take a binary signal from the computer and
          do something in the physical world. For example, a speaker will play sound,
          and a 3D printer will print an object. Output devices can also control physical
          motion like a robotic arm, the motor of a car, or the cutting tool of the
          milling machine that my company makes. New types of inputs and outputs let
          computers interact with the world in entirely new ways. This has been helped
          out by improvements to the speed and size of the memory and CPU.

        text: The more complicated a task is and the more information that is input
          or output, the more processing power and memory a computer needs. Typing
          letters on a screen may be easy but to do complicated 3d graphics or record
          a high-definition movie, modern computers often have multiple CPUs to process
          all that information and many gigabytes of memory to store it.

        text: 'No matter what it is you want to do with the computer, every single
          action is about: inputting information from the physical world, storing
          and processing that information, and getting some output back into the physical
          world.'

        text: But how do the hardware and the software interact with one another?
          Let's start at looking at a computer's central processing unit, or CPU.
      6:
        image: notes/csd_concept_hardware_software_6.png
        text: The CPU is the master chip that controls all the other parts of the
          computer. A CPU needs to do different things so inside it has smaller, simpler
          parts that handle specific tasks. It has circuits to do simple math and
          logic. It has other circuits to send and receive information to and from
          different parts of the computer.
      7:
        image: notes/csd_concept_hardware_software_7.png
        text: The real magic of the CPU is how it knows which circuits to use and
          when to use them. The CPU receives simple commands that tell it which circuit
          to use to do a specific job. For example, an "add" command tells the CPU
          to use its outer circuit to calculate a new number. And then the "store"
          command tells the CPU to use a different circuit to save that result into
          memory.
      8:
        image: notes/csd_concept_hardware_software_8.png
        text: Just like numbers, all of these simple commands can be represented in
          binary ones and zeros or on and off electrical signals. The binary commands
          are stored in memory and the CPU fetches and executes them in sequence one
          after the other. This sequence of commands is, in fact, a very simple computer
          program.
      9:

        text: Binary code is the most basic form of software and it controls all the
          hardware of a computer. These days, nobody writes software in binary. It
          would take forever!
      10:
        image: notes/csd_concept_hardware_software_10.png
        text: Today, the software we write looks more like this (Python), or this
          (Ruby), or even this (Blockly). Programming languages like these let you
          type in commands in something that looks a lot like English.

        text: To draw a rectangle on the screen, you just need a single command. This
          high-level command is converted into hundreds, or thousands, of simpler
          binary commands that the CPU understands. Software tells the CPU what to
          do, but when you're listening to music, and browsing the web, and chatting
          with a friend, your computer is running multiple pieces of software all
          at once.
      12:
        image: notes/csd_concept_hardware_software_12.png
        text: So, how do all of these programs get on the computer in the first place,
          and how can the CPU run them all at once? To find out we'll have to take
          a look at the operating system.
      13:
        image: notes/csd_concept_hardware_software_13.png
        text: The operating system of the computer is the master program that manages
          how software gets to use the hardware of the computer. For example, I helped
          create the Windows operating system that runs on most personal computers.
      14:

        text: The operating system is a program with special abilities that let it
          control the other software on the computer. It lets you install new programs
          by loading them into your computer's memory. It decides when a program is
          run by the central processing unit, and whether that program can access
          the computer's input and output devices. And when you think your computer
          is running many programs at once, in reality, it's the operating system
          that's quickly switching between programs sharing that CPU for fractions
          of a second.

        text: Computers have the potential to do all kinds of amazing things. But
          the only thing that makes the computer smart, or useful, is you. When you
          learn to code you get to define the problem you want to solve, and write
          the software that turns those ideas into reality.
