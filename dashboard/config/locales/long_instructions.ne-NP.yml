      4-5 Artist Patterns 7: |-
        Let's modify the code from the last puzzle
        to make this more complex pattern. Notice how the diamonds overlap now, try
        changing the first "jump backwards" from 100 to 50 (half as far) - now how
        far should the artist go in the second "jump backwards"?
      Course 4 Artist For Loops 6a: |-
        Make three small changes to the
        code from the last level to get this!
      K-1 Bee Loops 5: Use `repeat` loops to get the nectar and honey!
      K-1 Maze Loops 2: Use the `repeat` block to get me to the pig!
      K-1 Maze Loops 8: Use `repeat` loops to get me to the pig.
      Overworld Move to Sheep: |-
        Add a second “move forward” command to
        reach the sheep.
      Overworld Move to Sheep_2019: |-
        Add a second “move forward” command to
        reach the sheep.
      course4_artist_fwp_challenge1: Try running this program, and make changes to
        see what happens. Can you figure out how it works? (Or delete it and replace
        it with something totally different)
      courseF_bee_for_challenge2: |-
        Solve this puzzle with the fewest number of blocks
        possible.
      courseF_bee_for_challenge2_2018: |-
        Solve this puzzle with the fewest number of blocks
        possible.
      courseF_bee_for_challenge2_2019: |-
        Solve this puzzle with the fewest number of blocks
        possible.
      frozen circle: |-
        A circle is a special shape. Can you figure out
        what number to replace the question marks with to draw a circle?
      frozen circle function: |-
        Use the new “Create a circle” block to
        create 10 overlapping circles. Don't forget to jump forward between circles.
      frozen circle function in circle: |-
        Now let's create 20 overlapping
        circles, turning 18 degrees between each circle.
      frozen circle function with parameter: |-
        Here's a ”Create circle”
        block that can make circles of different sizes. Can you use this to create
        a small circle of size 5 and a larger circle of size 10?
      frozen cross: |-
        Wrap a “Repeat” block around these commands to create
        a plus sign. Did you notice Elsa can move forward and backward?
      frozen cross rotate: |-
        Now try repeating it 10 times. How many degrees
        do you need to turn between each line?
      frozen cross rotate dense: |-
        Let's repeat it 90 times! How many
        times does 90 go into 360? Hint: It's a really small number.
      frozen diamond: |-
        Use a repeat around these blocks to create a parallelogram.
        It's just like a rectangle but has different angles. This one has 60 degree
        and 120 degree angles instead of all 90 degree angles.
      frozen diamond mini snowflake: |-
        Did you know every snowflake is
        a different shape? Let's create a new snowflake by using another “Repeat"
        block to repeat a parallelogram 4 times, turning right by 90 degrees between
        each parallelogram.
      frozen diamond snowflake: |-
        Now, let's create a new snowflake by
        using the repeat block to repeat a parallelogram 10 times, turning right by
        36 degrees between each one.
      frozen freeplay: |-
        You've officially become a master artist!
        Create a winter wonderland.
      frozen perpendicular: |-
        Now let's see if we can create two lines
        that are at a 90 degree angle to each other. You will need to use the "Turn"
        block as well as the "Move" block.
      frozen snowflake branch: |-
        Try using the ”Create a snowflake branch”
        block to create three branches, which starts to look like a snowflake.
      frozen snowflake full: |-
        Now let's repeat it 8 times to make a
        beautiful snowflake!
      frozen snowflower: |-
        Intricate snow patterns can be created with
        very simple shapes. Can you make a pattern by repeating 5 circles of size
        5 and 5 circles of size 10?
      frozen square iterative: |-
        It seems like we're halfway to making
        a square. Let's put 4 lines together to create a square.
      frozen square loop: |-
        Hi, I’m Anna of Arendelle! Let’s make a square
        with the “Repeat” block, which uses fewer blocks. How many times (???) should
        the “Repeat” block loop the blocks inside it to make a square?
      frozen square loop 3x: |-
        Let's create three squares, turning after
        each square. Be sure to turn by 120 degrees before each new square.
      frozen square snowflake: |-
        Can you create a snowflake using the
        “Repeat” block to make a square 10 times, and the “Turn” block to turn 36
        degrees between each square?
