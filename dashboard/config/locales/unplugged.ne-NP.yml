          black card, you get a point."
        title: Conditionals
      ConditionalsPiecewiseFunctions:
        desc: The parameters we pass to functions cause the outputs to vary based

        title: Conditionals
      Contracts:
        desc: Contracts give us a way to understand and discuss functions. In this
          lesson we'll look at how Contracts can help us make sense of a new programming
          language or function.
        title: Contracts, Domain, and Range
      Crowdsourcing:
        desc: Students use crowdsourcing, a problem-solving technique common in computer
          science, to complete a task together as a classroom more efficiently than
          if a student attempted it alone.
        title: Crowdsourcing
      DesignRecipe:
        desc: In the last stage students wrote some very simple functions - but more
          sophisticated functions demand a more thoughtful approach. The Design Recipe
          is a structured approach to writing functions that includes writing test
          cases to ensure that the function works as expected.
        title: The Design Recipe
      DiceRace:

          functions is such a helpful practice.  '
        title: Songwriting With Parameters
      TangramAlgorithms:
        desc: This lesson shows us something important about algorithms. If you keep
          an algorithm simple there are lots of ways to use it. If you want to make
          sure everyone ends up with the same thing, then your algorithm needs more
          detail.
        title: Tangram Algorithms
      Unplug1:
        desc: This lesson will introduce the concept of Computer Science and explain
          what a Computer Scientist does.  It will also give students an opportunity
          to assume the role of a computer scientist.  By the end of the activity,
          each student will have a take-home reminder of what he or she learned.  You
          may be tempted to skip teaching young children the vocabulary words that
          are associated with the lessons that follow, but presenting them in a fun
          and playful light now is far more productive than waiting for more advanced
          opportunities.
        title: Introduction to Computer Science
      Unplug10:

          journey.
        title: Wrap-Up
      Unplug2:
        desc: With nothing but paper and markers, students will learn the four steps
          of computational thinking. After a brief introduction, students should be
          split into groups where they will have to create directions for other students
          to draw a specific monster (from a catalog of pre-selected monsters). The
          entire task must be decomposed, then teams will analyze all monsters in
          the catalog for patterns, abstract different details from the monsters,
          then use that information to create an algorithm (directions) for another
          team to draw a certain monster. Teams will then switch algorithms with another
          group and draw the monster based on what that algorithm indicates. Is the
          drawing what the original team intended?
        title: Computational Thinking
      Unplug3:
        desc: By programming one another to draw pictures, students will begin to
          understand what programming is really about. The class will begin by students
          instructing each other to color squares on graph paper in an effort to reproduce
          an existing picture.  If there's time, the lesson can conclude with images
          that the students create themselves.
        title: Graph Paper Programming
      Unplug4:
        desc: This lesson covers algorithms.  Using tangram shapes and graph paper,
          the first exercise will show how important it is to make each instruction
          as clear and unambiguous as possible.  Afterward, the class will explore
          how many ways you can fold paper into a rectangle, noting how some methods
          can take more or fewer folds than others.
        title: Algorithms
      Unplug5:
        desc: In this lesson, students will make a suncatcher out of string, beads,
          and a special charm. The students will follow a series of repetitive steps,
          then be asked to identify certain sets of "skills" that are duplicated several
          times. Once those skills are defined, they will be called from a main program
          and the whole beautiful process of creation will be recorded on a single
          sheet of paper. The final program will be geared toward the entire class,
          whatever their type of string, beads, and charms. To effectively allow for
          this, students will need to "abstract out" the details of their specific
          materials and create vague terms for an individual's supplies.  This use
          of generic placeholders is a wonderful introduction to variables.
        title: Functions
      Unplug6:
        desc: This is a class game.  After introducing the idea of conditionals, if-statements,
          and loops, the class can practice together using a pre-written program,
          a deck of cards, and luck of the draw.
        title: Conditions
      Unplug7:
        desc: Reading lyrics is a pretty intuitive venture for most students.  We'll
          take an activity that's already common knowledge and shift it into a solid
          education on defining and calling functions. Once students are familiar
          with the define/call process, we will add the extra capabilities that come
          along with passing parameters within those function calls.
        title: Song Writing
      Unplug8:
        desc: This activity combines your students' everyday routine and a Mad-Lib

        title: Abstraction
      Unplug9:
        desc: This lesson will take an idea from a previous activity (4. Graph Paper

          courses taught students that information can be represented in a variety
          of binary options.  This lesson takes that concept one step further as it
          illustrates how a computer can store even more complex information (such
          as images and colors) in binary, as well.

      courseD_unplugged_conditionalsCards:
        desc: To learn about conditional statements, students play a card game and
          create rules like "If I draw a red card, I get a point" and "If I draw a
          black card, you get a point."

      courseD_unplugged_graphPaperProgramming:
        desc: Students write an algorithm (a set of instructions) using a set of predefined
          commands to direct their classmates to reproduce a drawing.
        title: Graph Paper Programming
      courseD_unplugged_relayProgramming:
        desc: Students run a relay race, where they dash across the yard to write
          an algorithm based on a "Graph Paper Programming" image. They can only write
          one instruction at a time and if there's an error somewhere, they have to
          erase everything back to that point.
        title: Relay programming
      courseE_unplugged_crowdsourcing:
        desc: Students use crowdsourcing, a problem-solving technique common in computer
          science, to complete a task together as a classroom more efficiently than
          if a student attempted it alone.
        title: Crowdsourcing
      courseE_unplugged_diceRace:
        desc: This lesson calls out ways we use algorithms in our daily lives. As
          part of that, students will identify and write down the algorithm for a
          dice race game.
      courseE_unplugged_internet:
        desc: Students send messages representing various Internet transmission methods
          using pieces of paper.

      courseE_unplugged_songwriting:
        desc: Students use the concept of the chorus in a song to learn about defining
          and calling functions.

      courseF_unplugged_envelopeVariables:
        desc: Variables allow for a lot of freedom in computer science.  This lesson
          helps to explain what variables are and how we can use them in many different
          ways. Use this activity before (or in conjunction with) the lesson on abstraction
          to really hit the idea home.
        title: Envelope Variables
      courseF_unplugged_forLoopFun:
        desc: We know that loops allow us to do things over and over again, but now
          we’re going to learn how to use loops with extra structure built right in.

      courseF_unplugged_songwritingParameters:
        desc: 'One of the most magnificent structures in the computer science world
          is the function.  Functions (sometimes called procedures) are mini programs
          that you can use over and over inside of your bigger program. This lesson
          will help students intuitively understand why combining chunks of code into
          functions is such a helpful practice.  '

      courseF_unplugged_tangrams:
        desc: This lesson shows us something important about algorithms. If you keep
          an algorithm simple there are lots of ways to use it. If you want to make
          sure everyone ends up with the same thing, then your algorithm needs more
          detail.
