        Now that you've learned to write simple
        linear functions, let's work on using them to add some movement to our game.
        Click "Run" to see what your game can currently do (not much!), update any
        variables you like, and then click finish to move on.
      Big Game Animation 2 (copy 1): |-
        The function 'update-target'
        function takes the target's current x value, and returns an updated value.
        Complete the 'update-target' function so that it adds to the x value each
        time it is called. The more you add to x, the faster the target will go.
      Big Game Animation 2: |-
        The update-target function takes the target's
        current x value, and returns an updated value. Complete the update-target
        function so that it adds to the x value each time it is called. The more you
        add to x, the faster the target will go.
      Big Game Animation 3: |-
        The update-danger function should work just
        like update-target, except that the danger should move from the right side
        over towards the left. Complete update-danger to make the danger fly across
        the screen.
      Big Game Animation 4: |-
        At this point in your game, your danger
        should run across the screen from right to left, and your target should run
        across from left to right. They don't ever come back on screen once they've
        left, but we'll take care of that later. Take a minute to make sure your
        game is working like you want it to, and then click "Finish" to move on.
      Big Game Booleans 1: |-
        When you last worked on your game we got
        our target and danger sprites to fly across the screen, but they never come
        back. Click "Run" to see how your game is currently working, and then click
        finish and we'll work on making those sprites reappear on screen after they've
        left.
      Big Game Booleans 2: |-
        Go to the Functions section of the toolbox
        and complete the safe-left? function so that it returns true if the sprite's
        x coordinate is greater than -50. If you're successful you should see the
        Danger go off the left side and then return on the right side.
      Big Game Booleans 3: |-
        Now that you've got safe-left?, let's fill
        in safe-right? - it should take in a sprite's x coordinate and return true
        if that coordinate is less than 450. Once your safe-right? is complete you
        should see the Target go off the right side of the screen and return on the
        left.
      Big Game Booleans 4: |-
        Complete the onscreen? function so that it
        checks whether both safe-left? and safe-right? are true.
      Big Game Booleans 5: |-
        At this point your Danger should run across
        the screen from right to left, your Target should run across from left to
        right, and they should both return to the opposite side, repeatedly. Take
        a minute to make sure your game is working like you want it to, and then click
        "Finish" to move on.
      Big Game Collision 1 (copy 1): |-
        When you last worked on your game
        we got our target and danger sprites to fly across the screen, but they never
        come back. Click run to see how your game is currently working, and then click
        finish and we'll work on making those sprites reappear on screen after they've
        left.
      Big Game Collision 1: |-
        At this point you've programmed a video
        game with a moving Target and Danger, both of which return to the screen once
        they've left, and a Player that responds to keyboard input. Click "Run"
        to see how your game is currently working, and then we'll dig into the final
        missing piece - collision detection!
      Big Game Collision 2: |-
        To move the player up and down, we'll need
        to use a conditional block to figure out which key is pressed and respond
        accordingly. Computers read keypresses as numeric key codes - the up arrow
        is 38 and the down arrow is 40. You can lookup other key codes in your student
        workbook. Edit the 'update-player' function so that if moves the player
        up when the up arrow is pressed, or down when the down arrow is pressed.
      Big Game Collision 3: |-
        Use the Distance Formula, so the distance
        function returns the distance between the player's center coordinates (px,
        py) and another sprite's center coordinates (cx, cy).
      Big Game Collision 4: |-
        Complete the collide? function so that it
        returns true if the distance between two points is less than 100 pixels apart.

        game looks right now, and then we'll get to making your Player move up and
        down.
      Big Game Player 2: |-
        Edit the update-player function so the player
        moves up when the up arrow (keycode 38) is pressed, and moves down (keycode

      NetSim Standalone Automatic DNS: |-
        In this version of the Internet
        Simulator, a Domain Name System (DNS) is provided for you and knows the IP
        addresses of all connected computers. Send a message in the form GET [hostname]
        to the DNS service at address <yourRouterNumber>.15 to get a student's address.
      NetSim Standalone Broadcast: "In this version of the Internet Simulator,\nyou
        can connect to up to 5 other people in a room. When you send messages\nin
        the room, everyone receives them. What are some of the challenges of this\nsystem,
        and how might you solve them?\r\n"
      NetSim Standalone Classroom Routers: |-
        In this version of the Internet
        Simulator, everyone connects to a router and has a specific address. To send
        messages, you have to address your message to the specific address of the
        recipient, and the router will take care of delivering it to the right computer.
        If there are other routers created in your class, ask for the address of one
        of your classmates and send them a message! View the Log Router to see the
        path the messages have taken through the network.
      NetSim Standalone Freeplay: |-
        In this configuration, most of the
        options are turned on, and you can play with them. Have fun!
      NetSim Standalone Manual DNS: |-
        In this version of the simulator
        you can't see the other students' addresses.  Instead, one of you must act
        as a name service, to help share addresses with each other.
      NetSim Standalone Packets TCP: |
        Messages on the Internet can take
        many paths to get to their destination, and sometimes along the way the message
        gets dropped. In this version of the Internet Simulator, there is a 10% chance
        of a packet being dropped, multiple packets may take different paths to the
        destination, and the default max packet size is set to 6 additional characters.
      NetSim Standalone Routers Addresses: "For this activity, connect\nto a router
        with the others in your group. Important note: The router will\nonly properly
        route messages where the first 4 bits are the To: address and\nthe second
        4 bits are the From: address.\r\n\r\n[TODO: NetSim needs to support\nhierarchical
        addresses. For now, level is set up for 4 bit to and from addresses]"
      NetSim Standalone SendAB: |-
        You and your partner share a single
        wire that can only be in state A or state B. You can set the wire to either
        state at any time, and you can read the state of the wire at any time. Can
        you figure out a way to effectively communicate with just this system?
      NetSim Standalone Sending Numbers Ascii: |
        Now that you've transmitted
        information represented as decimal numbers, you can map those numbers to text
        characters to send text-based information back and forth. With a text-based
        protocol, you can easily represent and communicate all kinds of information.
      NetSim Standalone Sending Numbers: "You and your partner can now\nreliably send
        messages back and forth without extra coordination! While you're\nalways sending
        bits back and forth, you can also represent those bits as decimal\nnumbers.
        What kinds of information can you represent with this system? "
      NetSim_AddressingMessages: |-
        In this version of the simulator, you
        will connect to a Router instead of directly to another student. Enter an
        address in the "To" box to send a message to another student.
      NetSim_AutomaticDNS: |-
        In this version of the simulator a DNS service
        is provided for you. Send a message in the form GET [hostname] to the DNS
        service at address 15 to get a student's address.
      NetSim_ManualDNS: |-
        In this version of the simulator you can't
        see the other students' addresses.  Instead, one of you must act as a name
        service, to help share addresses with each other.
      NetSim_SendAB: |-
        Connect to another student.  Each of you can set
        the value of the wire between you to "A" or "B".  See if you can send

        In this version of the simulator, you can send
        numbers or ASCII characters to one another, one bit at a time.
      NetSim_SendBits: |-
        Connect to another student.  You can now set
        your wire to "0" or "1".  Send a message to your partner!

      PDAlg Updates Cond: |-
        When you went to PD in the summer, the Conditional
        block that you were introduced to was black and allowed any data type to be
        used. This proved to be confusing, given that every other function we've
        seen always produces the same type of data. To help make conditionals clearer
        and more consistent we've replaced the single black block with a separate
        block for each data type.
      PDAlg Updates Errors: |-
        Run the provided program and use the error
        messages to try and track down the bugs.
      PDAlg Updates Space: |-
        Making use of limited programming space (especially
        on small screens) is challenging with a block based language. To help with
        this we've added a few features. Experiment with this provided code to see
        how the space can be manipulated to deal with larger programs.

      Pixelation - Lesson 15 - Color Shades 4x4: |-
        We start you out with
        the 4x4 image Maddie created in the video. Your task is to fill a 4x4 grid
        with colors using 12-bits per pixel. Here are the requirements: Row 1 - fill
        with shades of red. Row 2 - shades of green. Row 3 - shades of blue. Row 4
        - shades of gray.
      Pixelation - Lesson 15 - Color Shades: |-
        We start you out with the
        row of shades of red that Maddie created in the video. Experiment with 6-bit

      Pixelation Bee: |-
        This larger image of a bee encodes color with
        12 bits per pixel, but viewing in hex makes it easier to see the color of
        each pixel. If you switch to binary mode - hold on to your hat - it's a lot
        of bits. Here's another mind-blowing thing to try: slide the bits per pixel
        up to 24 bits per pixel. What happens? Can you explain this behavior?

        A rocket blasts off, traveling at 15 meters
        per second. Using the Design Recipe, write a function called rocket-height
        that takes in a number of  seconds that have passed since the rocket took
        off, and produces the height of the rocket at that time.
      Play Lab Rocket 3: |-
        Awesome, now can you update that function so
        that our rocket moves more quickly? Make sure to update the purpose statement,

        at 2 seconds, 90 meters at 3 seconds, 160 at 4 seconds and so on?
      Play Lab Rocket 5: |-
        Much better, but let's write one more function

        Notice how we simplified the diamond code
        by turning it into a loop. You can loop that whole sequence 12 times to draw

        so you don't keep drawing over the same diamond.

        There is a new block in this lesson,
        the `random integer` block. It is used to choose a random number. Write a

      grade3_playLab_buildGame_2: |-
        We have already created a random integer,
        "j", which is either 1 or 0. Now, we need to use it to decide whether our
        card is red or black. Add a second if statement to the code under `when run`
        to complete this code.
      grade3_playLab_buildGame_3: |-
        There are 13 different card values
        in a deck of cards, so we'll need to have 13 options. Under the empty `when
        run` block, add a line that sets the placeholder "i" to a random integer
        between 1 and 13.
      grade3_playLab_buildGame_4: |-
        In a deck of cards, a card with value
        1 isn't actually called a "1", there's a special name. Write an if statement
        that checks if the random number is a 1, then tell the computer that the value
        of that card is "Ace".
      grade3_playLab_buildGame_5: |-
        We can just call the cards from 2
        to 10 by their numbers, so add an if statement that checks whether the number
        generated is within those numbers, then sets the card value to the number
        generated.

        There are three more cards with special
