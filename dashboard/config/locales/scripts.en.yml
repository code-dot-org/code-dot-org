            Hi there! This is a special unit that Code.org uses for User Interface (UI) testing. None of the lessons or levels in this unit are meant to be used in classrooms!

            If you're not a code.org engineer but managed to discover this unit: congratulations! It's like you discovered a secret on our website! But if you're looking for more info about our curricula or tools, we recommend checking out [https://code.org/educate/](https://code.org/educate/) instead.

            If you are a code.org engineer: this script contains all the level types for UI testing. Please sign in to test applab levels (By design, applab levels only work if signed in.

            Hi there! This is a special unit that Code.org uses for User Interface (UI) testing. None of the lessons or levels in this unit are meant to be used in classrooms!

            If you're not a code.org engineer but managed to discover this unit: congratulations! It's like you discovered a secret on our website! But if you're looking for more info about our curricula or tools, we recommend checking out [https://code.org/educate/](https://code.org/educate/) instead.

            If you are a code.org engineer: this script contains all the level types for UI testing. Please sign in to test applab levels (By design, applab levels only work if signed in. Normally, we make people sign in, but this is only enforceable for a whole script and would be annoying to do for this script).

                ### Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy


                * **Establishing a Strong Classroom Culture:** This unit is designed to be hands-on, collaborative, and exploratory. A major focus of the unit is building a positive classroom culture in which students work together, explore problems, and communicate about their thinking. Most lessons either feature physical manipulatives or a digital widget, and the bulk of lesson time should be spent with students exploring these tools together to develop an understanding of the concepts they highlight. The course intentionally does not start with programming since, in many classrooms, some students have experience with programming and others do not. Choosing to begin with digital information and the internet lets you build community in the room while exploring a topic that is likely to be accessible to all students. The supportive and inclusive classroom environment built in this unit should help set a positive tone that can be carried through the school year.


                * **Empowering "Deciders":**  An important goal of the course is not merely to teach students technical knowledge, but to put those skills to work in meaningful ways. This unit builds towards the unit project, which provides an opportunity for students to be "deciders" about the impacts of computing on modern life. Other units will emphasize empowering units as "creators."

                ### Major Assessment and Projects

                The unit project asks students to consider and debate issues that arise in modern society due to the digitizing of information. Students will analyze an article that addresses the intersection of digitizing information and current events. They will evaluate what data is being digitized and evaluate the benefits and harms caused by making this information digital. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.

It is designed to maintain the collaborative and inclusive classroom environment developed in the previous two units. The collaborative project, fun, unplugged activities, and the focus on experimenting should help keep your whole class working together and trying out ideas. \n\n* **Emphasizing Skills:** Since this is the first of many programming units, it emphasizes attitudes and skills that will serve your students well for the remainder of the year. The project that runs through this unit emphasizes that programming is a creative and collaborative endeavor that students can use to help others. Key practices like pair programming and debugging help normalize working with a partner, asking for help, and making mistakes. While students have a lot to learn about programming and App Lab, there is just as much emphasis on establishing these positive habits and mindsets. \n\n* **Empowering \"Creators\":** This unit empowers students to be creators with a major emphasis on making personally meaningful apps. Students have a lot to learn about programming. Still, the goal is for students to come away from this unit, seeing programming as a powerful form of personal expression that allows them to draw on their innate talents and interests to help solve problems in their community.\n\n### Major Assessment and Projects\n\nThe unit project asks students to collaborate with a classmate to design an app that can teach others about a topic of shared interest. Students practice interviewing classmates to identify the project's goals, mockup designs, collaboratively program the app and run simple user tests. The app itself must include at least three screens and demonstrate what students have learned about user interface design and event-driven programming. Students submit their app, project guide, and written responses to reflection questions about how the app is designed and the development process used to make it.

                ### Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy


                * **Intro to EIPM:** This unit is students' first experience with the Explore, Investigate, Practice, Make lesson sequence, or EIPM. This structured approach to teaching programming is covered in detail in the curriculum guide. We highly recommend watching the [accompanying video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNeqEl6MN7c2KyM3gdBSo8t3) to better understand what EIPM should look like in the classroom. When used effectively, it supports deep learning of content and helps maintain a collaborative classroom culture, even as you move into more complex programming concepts.

                * **Scaffolding Towards Independent Projects:** A major goal of this course is to empower students to design and build projects independently. The Create PT in Unit 8 offers students enormous freedom to scope and build projects, and even this unit begins scaffolding towards that goal. Individual EIPM sequences of lessons gradually prepare students for scoped, independent Make projects. The unit project has a few requirements, but students are largely free to choose the design, topic, and implementation of their ideas. As you teach the unit, look for the opportunities to scaffold the skills and knowledge students will need to creatively and independently tackle the unit project.


                ### Major Assessment and Projects

                The unit project asks students to design an app that makes a recommendation based on information from user input. Students are given a great deal of freedom to choose their topic, design their user interface, and decide how to actually program their app's behavior. Students submit their app, project guide, and written responses to reflection questions about how the app is designed and the development process they used to make it. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.

                ### Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy

                * **Independent Creation and The Hackathon Project:** Much like the project in Unit 4, the "Hackathon" project in this unit is designed as an opportunity for students to creatively and independently build something with their programming skills. While students are asked to include some technical requirements in their program to ensure they demonstrate mastery of new programming concepts, they have free rein to choose the goals, design, and implementation of their project. To avoid asking students to complete a major programming project right before the Create PT, this hackathon is the most "Create-PT-like" project of the course. It is the best chance for students to practice skills like budgeting time or scoping an open-ended project. In many classrooms, if you maintain the recommended pacing of the course, this project serves as an excellent end to the first semester.

                * **Growing Comfort with EIPM:** By Unit 5, students (and teachers!) should be developing greater comfort with the flow of EIPM lessons. Students may begin to anticipate that sequences build towards an independent Make lesson or look forward to stepping away from computers to Explore. A nice feature of EIPM is that you will find strategies and modifications to each lesson type that work best for your students. Keep an eye out for how you and your students are developing comfort with EIPM and note strategies that help meet your classroom's needs.

                * **Programming with Real-world Data:** The Data Library is a new feature in App Lab for the 2020-21 school year and was designed to let students program with data from the real world. This tool aims to motivate students to build new kinds of data-powered apps that they find personally interesting. This tool also facilitates programming with lists of information since students will need to manipulate lists of data to incorporate the different data sources. Encourage students to use datasets they find personally relevant as they draw on their creative ideas for bringing data to life.



                ### Major Assessment and Projects

                The unit project asks students to spend five days as part of a "Hackathon" project that they have nearly complete independence to scope and design. Students must choose one dataset from the Data Library in AppLab to be a component of their project to demonstrate what they have learned about lists and list processing; otherwise, scoping the project is completely up to them. Students submit their app, project guide, and written responses to reflection questions about how the app is designed and the development process they used to make it. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.

                ### Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy


                * **A Break from Programming:** This unit is intentionally designed as a short respite from programming. After three units and a major hackathon project, it is a great opportunity to get away from screens for a while before the final programming push that leads to the Create PT.

                * **Just Enough Math:** This unit includes some mathematical concepts which enrich students' understanding of how algorithms are analyzed, which might at first be a little intimidating to some students (and teachers!). The mathematical topics included in this unit are only those necessary to provide a solid foundation in algorithmic analysis to the depth described in the CS Principles framework. If you are a teacher with a strong mathematical background, check carefully that you do not needlessly add complexity to a unit that might already prove challenging for some students. All teachers should keep an eye out for the ways visuals, hands-on examples, and patterns in presentation style are used to ensure a consistent presentation of these mathematical topics.


                ### Major Assessment and Projects

                This unit does not conclude with a major project. Students will complete an end-of-unit assessment that is aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.

By having to write functions that other students find useful, they will need to think about common patterns or situations that they have seen in projects across the course. Students will also practice commenting their code so others can understand how it works, practice designing functions that use parameters and return.  \n\n* **Final Preparation for the Create PT:** Students learn very few new concepts in this unit; nevertheless, it can be challenging because students need to learn how to integrate the ideas of parameters and return with every other concept they have learned in this course. This unit presents a good opportunity to do a final review of every programming construct covered in the course as students prepare to demonstrate what they've learned on the Create PT.\n\n### Major Assessment and Projects\n\nThe unit project asks students to design a library of functions that they can share with classmates. Their library must contain at least two functions, and at least one of those functions must include a parameter, return, a loop, and an if-statement. This requirement ensures students practice skills they willll use in the Create PT. Using a project guide, students choose a theme for their library, build it, test it, and exchange feedback with other students. Students submit their library code, project guide, and written responses to reflection questions about how the app is designed and the development process they used to make it. They will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n\n### AP Connections\n\nThis unit and unit project helps build towards the enduring understandings listed below. For a detailed mapping of units to Learning Objectives and EKs, please see the \"Standards\" page for this unit.\n\n* CRD-2: Developers create and innovate using an iterative design process that is user-focused, that incorporates implementation/feedback cycles, and that leaves ample room for experimentation and risk-taking.\n* AAP-2: The way statements are sequenced and combined in a program determines the computed result. Programs incorporate iteration and selection constructs to represent repetition and make decisions to handle varied input values.\n* AAP-3: Programmers break down problems into smaller and more manageable pieces. By creating procedures and leveraging parameters, programmers generalize processes that can be reused. Procedures allow programmers to draw upon existing code that has already been tested, allowing them to write programs more quickly and with more confidence.\n\nThis unit includes content from the following topics from the AP CS Principles Framework.

Some lessons are designed around different steps of this process, like cleaning data or building visualizations. Other lessons focus on ways this process is applied in real-world contexts like citizen science or machine learning. The data analysis process helps provide a consistent reference point as students explore the importance of data analysis in computing. \n\n* **Exploring Data with the Data Visualizer:** The Data Visualizer is a tool built into App Lab that allows students to quickly create visualizations of the data they've added to their projects. The set of possible visualizations is intentionally limited to a few ways to change or modify the chart. This tool aims to encourage exploring the different kinds of questions that can be answered with data visualizations, with a greater emphasis on students' ability to create a variety of visualizations quickly.\n\n\n### Major Assessment and Projects\n\nStudents use the data visualizer to find and present a data story. Using what they've learned about the data analysis process, students either choose a dataset inside the data library or upload one of their own and create visualizations that find interesting patterns that may reveal new insights and knowledge. Students complete an activity guide describing their findings and the process they used in identifying them. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n\n### AP Connections\n\nThis unit and unit project helps build towards the enduring understandings listed below.

              description: "### Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy\n\n* **Learning Through Full-class Simulation:** The simulation project that runs through this unit serves several important goals. It helps contextualize what students are learning by moving from abstract ideas of privacy or security to concrete potential innovations. Since the simulation is based on modernizing schools, students can consider the consequences of computing innovations in a familiar setting. By taking on an assigned role and interacting with a group of teammates who have done the same, students must consider a breadth of interests and goals beyond their own when it comes to innovating in schools. \n\n* **Ending the Year as \"Deciders\":** A major theme students engage with throughout this unit is the need to consider both sides of technological innovation. Computing technology has led to both benefits and harms to culture, economy, and society at large. Responding to important questions facing our world requires understanding technology and an ability to identify and interpret the impacts it causes. This unit is not designed to advocate for any particular point of view on the impact of technology. Still, it should empower students to adeptly see and weigh the consequences of the technology around them. While the Create PT may feel like the most significant project of this course, the Explore Curricular requirement and the questions faced in this unit are arguably more crucial. Many of the young people who take CS Principles may pursue studies or careers in which they are \"creators\" with technology, but all of them will need to be thoughtful \"deciders\" in a world profoundly shaped by computing. \n\n\n### Major Assessment and Projects\n\nStudents complete the Future School Convention simulation throughout this unit. Working in teams of roughly five people, students are assigned a role and a set of interests they'll need to investigate. They research real-world innovations that could improve schools and align with the interests of their character. Throughout the unit, they are given opportunities to refine their proposals as a team and debate the benefits and risks of different computing innovations. Eventually, their team submits an overall proposal for the Future School, and all students vote for the team and innovation they believe to be the best. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with the CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n\n### AP Connections\n\nThis unit and unit project helps build towards the enduring understandings listed below.

             ### Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy
            * **Intro to EIPM:** This unit is students' first experience with the Explore, Investigate, Practice, Make lesson sequence, or EIPM. This structured approach to teaching programming is covered in detail in the curriculum guide and we highly recommend that you watch the [accompanying video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNeqEl6MN7c2KyM3gdBSo8t3) to better understand what EIPM should look like in the classroom. When used effectively, it supports deep learning of content and helps maintain a collaborative classroom culture, even as you move into more complex programming concepts.
            * **Scaffolding Towards Independent Projects:** A major goal of this course is to empower students to design and build projects independently. The Create PT in Unit 8 offers students enormous freedoms to scope and build projects, and even this unit begins scaffolding towards that goal. Individual EIPM sequences of lessons gradually prepare students for scoped, independent Make projects. The unit project has a few requirements, but students are largely free to choose the design, topic, and implementation of their ideas. As you teach the unit, look for the opportunities to scaffold the skills and knowledge students will need to creatively and independently tackle the unit project.
            ### Major Assessment and Projects
            The unit project asks students to design an app that makes a recommendation based on input information from the user. Students are given a great deal of freedom to choose their topic, design their user interface, and decide how to actually program their app's behavior. Students submit their app, project guide, and written responses to reflection questions about how the app is designed and the development process they used to make it. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.
            ### AP Connections
            This unit and unit project helps build towards the enduring understandings listed below. For a detailed mapping of units to Learning Objectives and EKs please see the "Standards" page for this unit.
            * CRD-2: Developers create and innovate using an iterative design process that is user-focused, that incorporates implementation/feedback cycles, and that leaves ample room for experimentation and risk-taking.
            * AAP-1: To find specific solutions to generalizable problems, programmers represent and organize data in multiple ways.
            * AAP-2: The way statements are sequenced and combined in a program determines the computed result. Programs incorporate iteration and selection constructs to represent repetition and make decisions to handle varied input values.
            * AAP-3: Programmers break down problems into smaller and more manageable pieces. By creating procedures and leveraging parameters, programmers generalize processes that can be reused. Procedures allow programmers to draw upon existing code that has already been tested, allowing them to write programs more quickly and with more confidence.
            This unit includes content from the following topics from the AP CS Principles Framework. For more detailed information on topic coverage in the course review [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dqYF5u0AULjw049gaCwAP34ZSe0VuEWbAjWoH1-YMW0/edit?usp=sharing).
            * 1.4 Identifying and Correcting Errors
            * 3.1 Variables and Assignment
            * 3.3 Mathematical Expressions
            * 3.5 Boolean Expressions
            * 3.6 Conditionals
            * 3.7 Nested Conditionals
            * 3.15 Random Values
            The College Board has supplied formative Create PT questions to help prepare students to complete the Create Task. We recommend that students complete the following prompts with the unit project. More information can be found in Code.org CS Principles Topic Coverage.

First, students will study the structure and elements of a haiku poem by reading poems together, decomposing a haiku poem into its parts, and writing a haiku. Then, students will learn how computers can take in user input and store it in its memory and will build a Poem Bot. Once they’ve built their Poem Bot, they will test their programs with their classmates and complete the project by sharing their user-generated poems in a poetry circle."

          title: Giving Objects State
          description: |-
            In this unit, students create objects and define instance variables to represent attributes. Students explore creating and using constructors to establish values for these attributes and learn how to work with the data stored in objects. Students implement accessor and mutator methods to access and modify the values stored in the instance variables as well as write `toString` methods to output information about the state of the object. While creating and working with objects, students use the `Scanner` class to obtain user input to use as program data, learn about data types, operators, and expressions to store and manipulate data in variables, and develop an understanding of data encapsulation and object-oriented design decisions.

            ### AP Classroom Personal Progress Checks
            To assign questions from the AP Classroom Question Bank that align with this unit, create a custom quiz in AP Classroom by searching the Question Bank for the Essential Knowledge statements on the unit's [**Standards**](https://studio.code.org/s/csa2-pilot-facilitator/standards) page. You can find instructions and video demonstrations to do this on [**AP Central**](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/instructional-resources/ap-classroom).

            The following Personal Progress Checks in AP Classroom can be assigned during the Show What You Know week:
            * Personal Progress Check 1
            * Personal Progress Check 5
            * Personal Progress Check 9

          description: |-
            In this unit, students learn how the use of APIs and libraries can expand the functionalities of their programs. Students learn to use relational and logical operators to expand the decisions for conditionals and iteration. Students use casting operators and `Math` class methods as they evaluate expressions and perform calculations, including implementing random in program decisions and behaviors. While working with compound Boolean expressions and logical operators, students develop an understanding of De Morgan's Laws and writing truth tables. Students use these expanded conditions and expressions to evaluate primitive values and object references and make decisions based on the results.

            In this unit, students use two-dimensional (2D) arrays to expand storage and organization capabilities in their programs. Students identify similarities and differences between 1D and 2D arrays when creating, accessing, and traversing these data structures. Students traverse 2D arrays using nested `for` loops and nested enhanced `for` loops in row-major and column-major order to apply the standard algorithms they developed in Unit 3 to access and manipulate elements.

          description: |-
            In this unit, students use `ArrayList`s to store program data and differentiate between when to use 1D and 2D arrays and `ArrayList`s. Students explore the benefits and functionality of an `ArrayList`, using these to solve problems involving numerical and object data. Students use methods in the `String` class to analyze and process text obtained from user and file input. Throughout the unit, students write program documentation using single-line comments, multi-line comments, and Javadoc comments to create API documentation. In the process, students identify and document preconditions and postconditions of objects and methods.

            ### AP Classroom Personal Progress Checks
            To assign questions from the AP Classroom Question Bank that align with this unit, create a custom quiz in AP Classroom by searching the Question Bank for the Essential Knowledge statements on the unit's [**Standards**](https://studio.code.org/s/csa6-pilot-facilitator/standards) page. You can find instructions and video demonstrations to do this on [**AP Central**](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/instructional-resources/ap-classroom).

            The following Personal Progress Checks in AP Classroom can be assigned during the Show What You Know week:
            * Personal Progress Check 2
            * Personal Progress Check 7

            ***Note:*** *Some Learning Objectives and Essential Knowledge statements in the suggested Personal Progress Checks are covered in later units.*

            This unit exposes students to object-oriented programming principles as they explore The Neighborhood. Students learn fundamental Java concepts as they navigate and interact with The Neighborhood with `Painter` objects and create new types of `Painter`s to expand the capabilities of their programs. Students practice predicting the outcome of program code and use their `Painter` objects with conditional statements, `while` loops, and Boolean expressions to navigate mazes and create drawings. While students work with the `Painter`, they practice identifying syntax and logic errors to explain why code segments will not compile or work as intended. Additionally, students learn to document program code using comments to describe the behavior of specific code segments. Throughout this unit, students discover their identity as software engineers and use debugging strategies and code reviews to improve their programming skills.

            This unit expands on the object-oriented programming principles introduced in Unit 1 to explore design principles as students develop classes with attributes and behaviors and work with primitive and object data. Students learn to work with variables and user input as they develop and utilize classes and objects to represent desserts, customers, and food trucks for the Project Mercury Pastries Food Truck business. As students work with the `Dessert` class, they build on their knowledge of inheritance to design subclasses that represent specific types of desserts. While working with variables, students learn to create and evaluate expressions using assignment and relational operators and trace code segments to determine the result of output. Throughout this unit, students continue to develop software engineering skills as they learn to use UML diagrams to represent classes and the DRY principle to refactor program code.

            This unit introduces students to data structures to store primitive values and object references. Students use one-dimensional (1D) arrays to represent lists of data while expanding their knowledge of loops and conditionals to analyze and process data in a 1D array. Students learn to use `for` loops to traverse arrays and discover that an algorithm involving loops can be implemented with either a `for` loop or a `while` loop. Throughout the unit, students develop and modify standard algorithms to find and manipulate elements in a 1D array while also discovering the concept of polymorphism when traversing arrays of objects. As part of the planning process, students identify the preconditions and postconditions that an algorithm must satisfy. Additionally, students learn to use the `static` and `final` keywords to create static variables to represent values shared with all classes and constants to represent values that cannot be changed.

          description: |
            We created Course F for students in the fifth grade. The course begins by looking at how users make choices in the apps they use. Students then learn to make a variety of Sprite Lab apps that also offer choices for the user. In the later lessons in the course, students will learn about variables in a variety of contexts. Students are given greater autonomy and more choices throughout this course. By the end of the course, students will have created interactive projects to share with their friends and family.

            ## Spring 2022 Open Preview
            This new version of Course F includes three new lessons, and we need your feedback! The new lessons are:

          title: ArrayLists and String Methods ('22-'23)
          description: |-
            This unit continues to expand on data structures to introduce students to creating lists using the `ArrayList` class. In the process, students learn about the `Integer` and `Double` classes and use their methods to parse data from text files and explore the limits of integer values. Students differentiate between when to use each type of data structure while learning about the structure and functionality of an `ArrayList`. Students apply standard algorithms to find and manipulate data in an `ArrayList` of numerical and object data. Throughout the unit, students learn to use the `String` class to analyze and process text obtained from a user and from file input while learning about basic natural language processing techniques and applications. Additionally, students further develop software engineering skills by writing Javadoc comments to create API documentation for their programs.

            ### AP Classroom Personal Progress Checks

          description: |-
            This unit allows students to practice software design and development using the skills they have learned throughout the curriculum while planning and developing a creative coding project to convey a personal interest or story using The Theater. Students use decomposition strategies and object-oriented principles to plan and implement their ideas while ensuring their projects meet specified requirements. In the process, students learn to write `private`, overloaded, and overridden methods and use the `super` keyword in a subclass method to call a superclass method while exploring the functionality of methods and their parameters. Throughout the unit, students practice tracing and writing recursive methods and comparing these methods to iterative solutions. With the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the year, students consider the need for maximizing system reliability as they explore bugs and issues in existing programs.

            In Web Development, students are empowered to create and share content on their own web pages. They begin by thinking about the role of the web and how it can be used as a medium for creative expression. As students develop their pages and begin to see themselves as programmers, they are encouraged to think critically about the impact of sharing information online and how to be more critical consumers of content. They are also introduced to problem solving as it relates to programming while they learn valuable skills such as debugging, using resources, and teamwork. At the conclusion of the unit, students will have created a personal website they can publish and share.

            In the Interactive Animations and Games unit, students create programmatic images, animations, interactive art, and games. Starting off with simple, primitive shapes and building up to more sophisticated sprite-based games, students become familiar with the programming concepts and the design process computer scientists use daily. They then learn how these simpler constructs can be combined to create more complex programs. In the final project, students develop a personalized, interactive program.

          description_short: Learn to program with physical devices.
          description: |-
            In the Physical Computing unit, students explore the role of physical devices in computing. Using App Lab and Adafruit’s Circuit Playground, students develop programs that utilize the same hardware inputs and outputs that you see in the smart devices, looking at how a simple rough prototype can lead to a finished product. Then, students explore how physical devices can be used to react to the world around them using a “maker” mindset to create prototypes with everyday materials.

            **Implementation Guidance for Physical Computing**
            - Complete the first three lessons of the Problem Solving and Computing unit before starting
            - This unit assumes students are familiar with App Lab, specifically using Design Mode to create a user interface and using Events to change the screen when clicking a button. This can be accomplished by having students complete the [App Lab Hour of Code](https://studio.code.org/s/applab-intro/reset) before starting this unit.
            - This unit requires students to have access to Circuit Playground's - [click here](https://code.org/circuitplayground) for more information about using Circuit Playground's in your classroom
            - Guidance for how to support students in programming levels and differentiate tasks are available in the [Programming Levels Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WGywQ25khB6-FB20x6wO9dGVO9_qJlWkuLVLREJS4Jo/preview) and [Differentiation Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15Y6Mo3fMUtHq16SSskABgcYE-5xfk-Ewv0z_o4uaLdI/preview)
            - You can view the full [Curriculum Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VUbXHxXqHj5QCb4eSb756KKc7NDzbOLZUE5bPPQmJR8/preview) and [Implementation Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/112OA3_KbicOotqopqUyvXoWPWszz3_LHeMlg0ikCabk/preview) for more information about this unit

            Answer this [**short survey**](https://studio.code.org/form/teacher_csd_unit_survey?survey_data%5Bunit_number%5D=6) to let the Code.org curriculum team know how the unit went.
          student_description: This unit explores the role of hardware platforms in computing and how different sensors can provide more effective input and output than the traditional keyboard, mouse, and monitor. Using App Lab and Adafruit’s Circuit Playground, you’ll develop programs that utilize the same hardware inputs and outputs that you see in the smart devices, looking at how a simple rough prototype can lead to a finished product. The unit concludes with a design challenge to use the Circuit Playground as the basis for an innovation of your own design.

          description: |-
            This unit exposes students to object-oriented programming principles as they explore The Neighborhood. Students learn fundamental Java concepts as they navigate and interact with The Neighborhood with `Painter` objects and create new types of `Painter`s to expand the capabilities of their programs. Students practice predicting the outcome of program code and use their `Painter` objects with conditional statements, `while` loops, and Boolean expressions to navigate mazes and create drawings. While students work with the `Painter`, they practice identifying syntax and logic errors to explain why code segments will not compile or work as intended. Additionally, students learn to document program code using comments to describe the behavior of specific code segments. Throughout this unit, students discover their identity as software engineers and use debugging strategies and code reviews to improve their programming skills.

            ### AP Classroom Personal Progress Checks
            To assign questions from the AP Classroom Question Bank that align with this unit, create a custom quiz in AP Classroom by searching the Question Bank for the Essential Knowledge statements on the unit's [**Standards**](https://studio.code.org/s/csa1-2022/standards) page. You can find instructions and video demonstrations to do this on [**AP Central**](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/instructional-resources/ap-classroom).

          description: |-
            This unit expands on the object-oriented programming principles introduced in Unit 1 to explore design principles as students develop classes with attributes and behaviors and work with primitive and object data. Students learn to work with variables and user input as they develop and utilize classes and objects to represent desserts, customers, and food trucks for the Project Mercury Pastries Food Truck business. As students work with the `Dessert` class, they build on their knowledge of inheritance to design subclasses that represent specific types of desserts. While working with variables, students learn to create and evaluate expressions using assignment and relational operators and trace code segments to determine the result of output. Throughout this unit, students continue to develop software engineering skills as they learn to use UML diagrams to represent classes and the DRY principle to refactor program code.

          description: |-
            This unit introduces students to data structures to store primitive values and object references. Students use one-dimensional (1D) arrays to represent lists of data while expanding their knowledge of loops and conditionals to analyze and process data in a 1D array. Students learn to use `for` loops to traverse arrays and discover that an algorithm involving loops can be implemented with either a `for` loop or a `while` loop. Throughout the unit, students develop and modify standard algorithms to find and manipulate elements in a 1D array while also discovering the concept of polymorphism when traversing arrays of objects. As part of the planning process, students identify the preconditions and postconditions that an algorithm must satisfy. Additionally, students learn to use the `static` and `final` keywords to create static variables to represent values shared with all classes and constants to represent values that cannot be changed.

          description: |-
            This unit expands on data structures introduced in Unit 3 to create tables of data using two-dimensional (2D) arrays. Students identify similarities and differences between 1D and 2D arrays when creating, accessing, and traversing 2D arrays and apply standard algorithms to find and manipulate elements. As students analyze problems involving 2D arrays, they revisit these standard algorithms to determine what code needs to be added or modified and to interact with completed program code. Students apply these concepts to manipulate pixels and in The Theater to create image filters in addition to working with primitive values and various object references. Additionally, students use the programming knowledge and skills they have acquired to consider the impacts of programs on society, economies, and culture.

            This unit allows students to practice software design and development using the skills they have learned throughout the curriculum while planning and developing a creative coding project to convey a personal interest or story using The Theater. Students use decomposition strategies and object-oriented principles to plan and implement their ideas while ensuring their projects meet specified requirements. In the process, students learn to write `private`, overloaded, and overridden methods and use the `super` keyword in a subclass method to call a superclass method while exploring the functionality of methods and their parameters. Throughout the unit, students practice tracing and writing recursive methods and comparing these methods to iterative solutions. With the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the year, students consider the need for maximizing system reliability as they explore bugs and issues in existing programs.

Students learn to write no-argument constructors to assign default values and parameterized constructors to assign specific values to an object's instance variables. They explore how the `this` keyword can be used to reduce ambiguity and redundancies in their program and how the `super` keyword can be used to call a superclass constructor or method. Students also learn how to work with variables and write expressions using arithmetic and compound assignment operators and practice tracing code segments to determine the output.

          student_description: "This unit expands on the object-oriented programming principles introduced in Unit 1 to explore design principles as you develop classes with attributes and behaviors and work with primitive and object data. You learn to work with variables and user input as you develop and utilize classes and objects to represent desserts, customers, and food trucks for the Project Mercury Pastries Food Truck business. As you work with the `Dessert` class, you build on your knowledge of inheritance to design subclasses that represent specific types of desserts. While working with variables, you learn to create and evaluate expressions using assignment and relational operators and trace code segments to determine the result of output. Throughout this unit, you continue to develop software engineering skills as you learn to use UML diagrams to represent classes and the DRY principle to refactor program code.\n\n<details style=\"padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">\n    <summary style=\"font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;\">\U0001F3AF Unit Objectives</summary>\n    <div style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;\">\n        <p><strong><em>By the end of this unit, you will be able to . . .</em></strong></p>\n\n* Represent attributes of an object using instance variables\n\n* Write no-argument and parameterized constructors to set the state of an object\n\n* Use the `super` keyword to refer to the superclass in constructors and methods\n\n* Write expressions using arithmetic operators and compound assignment operators with variables and object data\n\n* Write accessor and mutator methods to obtain and modify object data\n\n* Write `toString()` methods and use escape sequences to display and format information about an object to the console\n    </div>\n</details>"

          description_short: The Magpie Lab explores the basics of natural language processing as students create a chatbot program. Students work with a variety of methods of the String class and practice using if statements to evaluate user input to determine an appropriate response.
          description: |-
            From Eliza in the 1960s to Siri and Watson today, the idea of talking to computers in natural language has fascinated people. (And yes, there have been more than one conversation between Eliza and Siri – search for "chatbot Eliza Siri.") While natural language processing (NLP) is a complicated field, it is fairly easy to create a simple program to respond to English sentences.

            From Eliza in the 1960s to Siri and Watson today, the idea of talking to computers in natural language has fascinated people. More and more, computer programs allow people to interact with them by typing English sentences. The field of computer science that addresses how computers can understand human language is called natural language processing (NLP).

            NLP is a field that attempts to have computers understand natural (i.e., human) language. There are many exciting breakthroughs in the field.

            For this lab, you will explore some of the basics of NLP. As you explore this, you will work with a variety of methods of the `String` class and practice using the `if` statement. You will trace a method to find words in user input.

          description_short: The Consumer Review lab explores how reviews for products and services are evaluated and sometimes manipulated. Students work with methods in the String class and practice using conditionals and iteration to design and implement algorithms to process text files containing reviews.
          description: |-
            The Consumer Review Lab provides students with the opportunity to work on a larger assignment involving multiple classes early in the course, before they necessarily know how to write their own classes. By focusing on calling methods and using the control structures of selection and iteration, students will have practice that directly relates to the **Methods and Control Structures** free-response question type that they will see on the end-of-year exam. Because students often struggle with methods in the `String` class, this lab specifically focuses on calling these methods and building strings in an interesting and engaging way.

            ###Real-World Connection

            We all use reviews on a regular basis, to help us determine which movie to see, which video game to play, or even which pair of headphones to buy. But how easy is it to fake a review? The truth is that it's incredibly simple, and fake reviews can have significant impacts on the products that are purchased or consumed, including movies that people watch and restaurants where they choose to eat. If consumers knew that the review they were reading and using to base a decision on came from a computer program and not a human, they might be less likely to believe it.

            What motivation do people have for creating these fake reviews or comments, and what should be done to prevent it, if anything? If technology can be used to create and post positive reviews for the company's own products or negative reviews of the competition, what are the ethical implications of this?

            Creating fake reviews has ethical implications, and it is important to emphasize that although students are going through the process to see one way in which they can be generated, this is in no way advocating this type of behavior. This is similar to "white hat" hackers needing to understand the same tools and processes of criminal hackers in order to do their job. Discuss with students the ethical concerns and how understanding this process is important to preventing unwanted behaviors online.

            In Web Development, students are empowered to create and share content on their own web pages. They begin by thinking about the role of the web and how it can be used as a medium for creative expression. As students develop their pages and begin to see themselves as programmers, they are encouraged to think critically about the impact of sharing information online and how to be more critical consumers of content. They are also introduced to problem solving as it relates to programming while they learn valuable skills such as debugging, using resources, and teamwork. At the conclusion of the unit, students will have created a personal website they can publish and share.

            ::: details [**Chapter 1 Overview**]
            **Description:** Students use computing as a form of self expression as they design and develop basic web pages.   Focusing on the tags, keywords, and syntax used to communicate instructions to the computer, students use HTML to structure the content of a web page. They also explore the privacy and intellectual property implications of publishing their work online.

            **Goals:**
            * Create digital artifacts that use multiple computer languages to control the structure and style of their content.
            * Create a website as a form of personal expression.
            * Use different programming languages to solve different problems.
            * Examine their role and responsibilities as both creators and consumers of digital media.

            **Big Questions:**
            * Why do people create websites?
            * How can text communicate content, structure, and style on a web page?
            * How do I safely and appropriately make use of the content published on the Internet?
            * What strategies can I use when coding to find and fix issues?

A major focus of the unit is building a positive classroom culture in which students work together, explore problems, and communicate about their thinking. Most lessons either feature physical manipulatives or a digital widget, and the bulk of lesson time should be spent with students exploring these tools together to develop an understanding of the concepts they highlight. The course intentionally does not start with programming since, in many classrooms, some students have experience with programming and others do not. Choosing to begin with digital information and the internet lets you build community in the room while exploring a topic that is likely to be accessible to all students. The supportive and inclusive classroom environment built in this unit should help set a positive tone that can be carried through the school year.\n\n\n####Empowering \"Deciders\"\n An important goal of the course is not merely to teach students technical knowledge, but to put those skills to work in meaningful ways. This unit builds towards the unit project, which provides an opportunity for students to be \"deciders\" about the impacts of computing on modern life. Other units will emphasize empowering units as \"creators.\"\n:::\n\n\n\n::: details [**⭐️ Major Assessment and Projects**]\n\n&nbsp\n\nThe unit project asks students to consider and debate issues that arise in modern society due to the digitizing of information. Students will analyze an article that addresses the intersection of digitizing information and current events. They will evaluate what data is being digitized and evaluate the benefits and harms caused by making this information digital. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\n::: details [**✅ AP Connections**]\n&nbsp\n\nThis unit and its associated project help build towards the enduring understandings listed below. For a detailed mapping of units to Learning Objectives and EKs, please see the \"Standards\" page for this unit.\n\n* DAT-1: The way a computer represents data internally is different from the way the data is interpreted and displayed for the user. Programs are used to translate data into a representation more easily understood by people.\n* IOC-1: while computing innovations are typically designed to achieve a specific purpose, they may have unintended consequences\n\nThis unit includes content from the following topics from the AP CS Principles Framework.

The collaborative project, fun, unplugged activities, and the focus on experimenting should help keep your whole class working together and trying out ideas. \n\n####Emphasizing Skills \nSince this is the first of many programming units, it emphasizes attitudes and skills that will serve your students well for the remainder of the year. The project that runs through this unit emphasizes that programming is a creative and collaborative endeavor that students can use to help others. Key practices like pair programming and debugging help normalize working with a partner, asking for help, and making mistakes. While students have a lot to learn about programming and App Lab, there is just as much emphasis on establishing these positive habits and mindsets. \n\n####Empowering \"Creators\"\nThis unit empowers students to be creators with a major emphasis on making personally meaningful apps. Students have a lot to learn about programming. Still, the goal is for students to come away from this unit, seeing programming as a powerful form of personal expression that allows them to draw on their innate talents and interests to help solve problems in their community.\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: details [**⭐️ Major Assessment and Projects**]\n\n&nbsp\n\nThe unit project asks students to collaborate with a classmate to design an app that can teach others about a topic of shared interest. Students practice interviewing classmates to identify the project's goals, mockup designs, collaboratively program the app and run simple user tests. The app itself must include at least three screens and demonstrate what students have learned about user interface design and event-driven programming. Students submit their app, project guide, and written responses to reflection questions about how the app is designed and the development process used to make it. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\n::: details [**✅ AP Connections**]\n&nbsp\n\nThis unit and unit project helps build towards the enduring understandings listed below.

This structured approach to teaching programming is covered in detail in the curriculum guide. We highly recommend watching the [accompanying video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNeqEl6MN7c2KyM3gdBSo8t3) to better understand what EIPM should look like in the classroom. When used effectively, it supports deep learning of content and helps maintain a collaborative classroom culture, even as you move into more complex programming concepts.\n\n####Scaffolding Towards Independent Projects \n\nA major goal of this course is to empower students to design and build projects independently. The Create PT in Unit 8 offers students enormous freedom to scope and build projects, and even this unit begins scaffolding towards that goal. Individual EIPM sequences of lessons gradually prepare students for scoped, independent Make projects. The unit project has a few requirements, but students are largely free to choose the design, topic, and implementation of their ideas. As you teach the unit, look for the opportunities to scaffold the skills and knowledge students will need to creatively and independently tackle the unit project.\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\n::: details [**⭐️ Major Assessment and Projects**]\n\n&nbsp\n\nThe unit project asks students to design an app that makes a recommendation based on information from user input.

In the unit project, you'll analyze a dataset of your choosing and present your findings. \n\n::: details [**\U0001F9D0 Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy**]\n\n####The Data Analysis Process\nThis unit is built around a data analysis process that helps students break down how data is turned into new information about the world. Some lessons are designed around different steps of this process, like cleaning data or building visualizations. Other lessons focus on ways this process is applied in real-world contexts like citizen science or machine learning. The data analysis process helps provide a consistent reference point as students explore the importance of data analysis in computing. \n\n####Exploring Data with the Data Visualizer\nThe Data Visualizer is a tool built into App Lab that allows students to quickly create visualizations of the data they've added to their projects. The set of possible visualizations is intentionally limited to a few ways to change or modify the chart. This tool aims to encourage exploring the different kinds of questions that can be answered with data visualizations, with a greater emphasis on students' ability to create a variety of visualizations quickly. This exploration should also help students build more meaningful and powerful apps in future units when they start using these datasets in their programs.\n:::\n\n::: details [**⭐️ Major Assessment and Projects**]\n&nbsp\n\nStudents use the data visualizer to find and present a data story. Using what they've learned about the data analysis process, students either choose a dataset inside the data library or upload one of their own and create visualizations that find interesting patterns that may reveal new insights and knowledge. Students complete an activity guide describing their findings and the process they used in identifying them.

While students are asked to include some technical requirements in their program to ensure they demonstrate mastery of new programming concepts, they have free rein to choose the goals, design, and implementation of their project. To avoid asking students to complete a major programming project right before the Create PT, this hackathon is the most \"Create-PT-like\" project of the course. It is the best chance for students to practice skills like budgeting time or scoping an open-ended project. In many classrooms, if you maintain the recommended pacing of the course, this project serves as an excellent end to the first semester.\n\n####Growing Comfort with EIPM\nBy this unit, students (and teachers!) should be developing greater comfort with the flow of EIPM lessons. Students may begin to anticipate that sequences build towards an independent Make lesson or look forward to stepping away from computers to Explore. A nice feature of EIPM is that you will find strategies and modifications to each lesson type that work best for your students. Keep an eye out for how you and your students are developing comfort with EIPM and note strategies that help meet your classroom's needs.\n\n####Programming with Real-world Data\nThe Data Library is a feature in App Lab designed to let students program with data from the real world. This tool aims to motivate students to build new kinds of data-powered apps that they find personally interesting. This tool also facilitates programming with lists of information since students will need to manipulate lists of data to incorporate the different data sources. Encourage students to use datasets they find personally relevant as they draw on their creative ideas for bringing data to life.\n:::\n\n\n\n::: details [**⭐️ Major Assessment and Projects**]\nThe unit project asks students to spend five days as part of a \"Hackathon\" project that they have nearly complete independence to scope and design. Students must choose one dataset from the Data Library in AppLab to be a component of their project to demonstrate what they have learned about lists and list processing; otherwise, scoping the project is completely up to them. Students submit their app, project guide, and written responses to reflection questions about how the app is designed and the development process they used to make it.

This tool allows them to build and share libraries of functions that they can use in many different projects. This tool serves many purposes besides simply teaching students about libraries. By having to write functions that other students find useful, they will need to think about common patterns or situations that they have seen in projects across the course. Students will also practice commenting their code so others can understand how it works, practice designing functions that use parameters and return.  \n\n####Final Preparation for the Create PT\nStudents learn very few new concepts in this unit; nevertheless, it can be challenging because students need to learn how to integrate the ideas of parameters and return with every other concept they have learned in this course. This unit presents a good opportunity to do a final review of every programming construct covered in the course as students prepare to demonstrate what they've learned on the Create PT.\n:::\n\n\n\n::: details [**⭐️ Major Assessment and Projects**]\n&nbsp\n\nThe unit project asks students to design a library of functions that they can share with classmates. Their library must contain at least two functions, and at least one of those functions must include a parameter, return, a loop, and an if-statement. This requirement ensures students practice skills they will use in the Create PT. Using a project guide, students choose a theme for their library, build it, test it, and exchange feedback with other students. Students submit their library code, project guide, and written responses to reflection questions about how the app is designed and the development process they used to make it.

It helps contextualize what students are learning by moving from abstract ideas of privacy or security to concrete potential innovations. Since the simulation is based on modernizing schools, students can consider the consequences of computing innovations in a familiar setting. By taking on an assigned role and interacting with a group of teammates who have done the same, students must consider a breadth of interests and goals beyond their own when it comes to innovating in schools. \n\n####Ending the Year as \"Deciders\"\nA major theme students engage with throughout this unit is the need to consider both sides of technological innovation. Computing technology has led to both benefits and harms to culture, economy, and society at large. Responding to important questions facing our world requires understanding technology and an ability to identify and interpret the impacts it causes. This unit is not designed to advocate for any particular point of view on the impact of technology. Still, it should empower students to adeptly see and weigh the consequences of the technology around them. While the Create PT may feel like the most significant project of this course, the Explore Curricular requirement and the questions faced in this unit are arguably more crucial. Many of the young people who take CS Principles may pursue studies or careers in which they are \"creators\" with technology, but all of them will need to be thoughtful \"deciders\" in a world profoundly shaped by computing. \n:::\n\n\n\n::: details [**⭐️ Major Assessment and Projects**]\n&nbsp\n\nStudents complete the Future School Convention simulation throughout this unit. Working in teams of roughly five people, students are assigned a role and a set of interests they'll need to investigate. They research real-world innovations that could improve schools and align with the interests of their character. Throughout the unit, they are given opportunities to refine their proposals as a team and debate the benefits and risks of different computing innovations. Eventually, their team submits an overall proposal for the Future School, and all students vote for the team and innovation they believe to be the best.

Learn about the concept of algorithmic efficiency through a variety of hands-on activities and learn how it's being applied in modern computing.\n\n::: details [**\U0001F9D0 Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy**]\n\n####Just Enough Math\nThis unit includes some mathematical concepts which enrich students' understanding of how algorithms are analyzed, which might at first be a little intimidating to some students (and teachers!). The mathematical topics included in this unit are only those necessary to provide a solid foundation in algorithmic analysis to the depth described in the CS Principles framework. If you are a teacher with a strong mathematical background, check carefully that you do not needlessly add complexity to a unit that might already prove challenging for some students. All teachers should keep an eye out for the ways visuals, hands-on examples, and patterns in presentation style are used to ensure a consistent presentation of these mathematical topics.\n:::\n\n\n\n::: details [**⭐️ Major Assessment and Projects**]\n&nbsp\n\nThis unit does not conclude with a major project. Students will complete an end-of-unit assessment that is aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n:::\n\n\n::: details [**✅ AP Connections**]\n&nbsp\n\nThis unit helps build towards the enduring understandings listed below. For a detailed mapping of units to Learning Objectives and EKs, please see the \"Standards\" page for this unit.\n\n* AAP-2: The way statements are sequenced and combined in a program determines the computed result. Programs incorporate iteration and selection constructs to represent repetition and make decisions to handle varied input values.\n* AAP-4: There exist problems that computers cannot solve, and even when a computer can solve a problem, it may not be able to do so in a reasonable amount of time.\n* CSN-2: Parallel and distributed computing leverage multiple computers to more quickly solve complex problems or process large data sets.\n\nThis unit includes content from the following topics from the AP CS Principles Framework.

          description: "In the Creating Apps with Devices unit, students explore the role of physical devices in computing. Using App Lab and Adafruit’s Circuit Playground, students develop programs that utilize the same hardware inputs and outputs that you see in the smart devices, looking at how a simple rough prototype can lead to a finished product. Then, students explore how physical devices can be used to react to the world around them using a “maker” mindset to create prototypes with everyday materials.\n\n⚠️ This unit uses the **Circuit Playground** to introduce physical computing and the \"maker\" mindset. You can also teach this content using **micro:bit** devices by assigning the [Creating Apps with Devices - micro:bit unit](/s/microbit-2023). Both units teach the same content and are equivalent - you do not need to buy both sets of devices or teach both units.\n\n::: details [**Chapter 1 Overview**]\n**Description:** This unit emphasizes the interactions between inputs and outputs on the circuit playground and an app screen. On their circuit playground, students learn to control inputs like buttons or toggle switches and outputs like the buzzer or LED. Students also interact with inputs and outputs in App Lab, such as buttons and text inputs and dropdowns. By the end of the chapter, students will be able to create an app that controls a device, similar to many \"smart\" hardware they may experience in their day-to-day lives.\n\n\n**Goals:**\n* Design and build a physical computing device that integrates physical inputs and outputs with digital apps. \n* Create app prototypes that use a physical device to control a digital app.\n\n\n**Big Questions:**\n- What inputs and outputs are available on a physical device?\n- What inputs and outputs are available on an app?\n- How can we create apps that use a physical device to control a digital app?\n\n:::\n\n::: details [**Chapter 2 Overview**]\n**Description:** In this chapter, students focus on how their physical device can interact with the outside world. They learn how to use sensors and the accelerometer to react to the physical environment. They learn to attach external LEDs and buttons that extend the types of devices they can make. Throughout the unit, students use physical materials like paper or cardboard to extend the functionality of their devices. By the end of the unit, students will have created an interactive art project and developed a prototype for a physical device that solves a problem.\n\n\n**Goals:**\n* Design and build a physical computing device that integrates sensors with digital apps. \n* Create app prototypes that use a physical device to solve real-world problems.\n* Use physical computing to solve problems in fun and innovative ways.\n\n\n**Big Questions:**\n- How can a physical device use sensors to react to a physical environment?\n- How can simple hardware be used to develop innovative new products?\n\n:::\n\n\n::: details [**Implementation Guidance for Creating Apps with Devices**]\n- This unit requires students to have access to Circuit Playground's - [click here](https://code.org/maker/circuitplayground) for more information about using Circuit Playground's in your classroom\n- Guidance for how to support students in programming levels and differentiate tasks are available in the [Programming Levels Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WGywQ25khB6-FB20x6wO9dGVO9_qJlWkuLVLREJS4Jo/preview) and [Differentiation Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15Y6Mo3fMUtHq16SSskABgcYE-5xfk-Ewv0z_o4uaLdI/preview)\n:::\n\n::: details [**Professional Development**]\nIf you are interested in teaching this course, we recommend completing the free [Creating Apps for Devices Self-Paced Professional Development Module](https://studio.code.org/courses/self-paced-pl-physical-computing).

          student_description: This unit explores the role of hardware platforms in computing and how different sensors can provide more effective input and output than the traditional keyboard, mouse, and monitor. Using App Lab and Adafruit’s Circuit Playground, you’ll develop programs that utilize the same hardware inputs and outputs that you see in the smart devices, looking at how a simple rough prototype can lead to a finished product. The unit concludes with a design challenge to use the Circuit Playground as the basis for an innovation of your own design.

Let students build and play in an imaginary town. Or after a shared experience (ie recess or field trip) create a topographical map using play-dough or salt dough.\n\n\n**Computer Science:** In this module students will be working a lot with sprites including changing the location and size of them and initiating behaviors.

            These lessons supplement the [How Blockchain Works](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNdzDlGJxd6B22G1bCDnPzkf) video series. Each lesson focused on a single video from the series, diving-deeper into the concepts introduced in the videos. Lessons focus on creating an **immersive experience** for students, where students engage in an activity or simulation and then reflect on the experience as a way to build understanding around Blockchain technology and empathy with its users. Some lessons focus more on the technology behind Blockchain, while other lessons focus on the economic and societal impacts of Blockchain technologies.

          description: |-
            In Web Development, students are empowered to create and share content on their own web pages. They begin by thinking about the role of the web and how it can be used as a medium for creative expression. As students develop their pages and begin to see themselves as programmers, they are encouraged to think critically about the impact of sharing information online and how to be more critical consumers of content. They are also introduced to problem solving as it relates to programming while they learn valuable skills such as debugging, using resources, and teamwork. At the conclusion of the unit, students will have created a personal website they can publish and share.

            ::: details [**Chapter 1 Overview**]
            **Description:** Students use computing as a form of self expression as they design and develop basic web pages.   Focusing on the tags, keywords, and syntax used to communicate instructions to the computer, students use HTML to structure the content of a web page. They also explore the privacy and intellectual property implications of publishing their work online.

            **Goals:**
            * Create digital artifacts that use multiple computer languages to control the structure and style of their content.
            * Create a website as a form of personal expression.
            * Use different programming languages to solve different problems.
            * Examine their role and responsibilities as both creators and consumers of digital media.

            **Big Questions:**
            * Why do people create websites?
            * How can text communicate content, structure, and style on a web page?
            * How do I safely and appropriately make use of the content published on the Internet?
            * What strategies can I use when coding to find and fix issues?
            :::

            ::: details [**Chapter 2 Overview**]
            **Description:** Students expand their ideas of websites beyond personal expression and begin to see them as a way to solve problems.  Students build on their collaborative skills and work in teams to create multi-page websites that solve a problem.

            **Goals:**
            * Create digital artifacts that use multiple computer languages to control the structure and style of their content.
            * Create a website that solves a problem.
            * Use different programming languages to solve different problems.
            * Examine their role and responsibilities as both creators and consumers of digital media.

            **Big Questions:**
            * How can websites be used to address problems in the world?

The unit culminates in designing a machine learning app to solve a personally relevant problem.\n\n::: details [**Chapter 1 Overview**]\n**Description:** Students learn the basics of machine learning and use a tool called AI Lab to create machine learning models that can be used in App Lab. The unit starts with an overview of machine learning and how computers can use patterns in data to make decisions and predictions. Then, students learn how to use AI Lab to train models from tabular data while exploring issues of bias. Lessons follow a repeating \"unplugged - AI Lab - App Lab\" pattern so students are continually exposed to the concepts and tools of machine learning. The chapter culminates in a project where students select from a set of real-world datasets to train a machine learning model and create an app.\n\n\n**Goals:**\n* Create a machine learning model in AI Lab to solve a problem, and use App Lab to create an app that uses their model. \n* Understand how machine learning models make decisions from data\n\n\n**Big Questions:**\n- How does machine learning find patterns in data to make decisions?\n- How can we avoid bias when training a machine learning model?\n\n:::\n\n::: details [**Chapter 2 Overview**]\n**Description:** This chapter prepares students to be machine learning scientists to create an app that addresses an issue in their community. Students follow along with a fictional group of students as they define an issue, develop a survey to collect data, analyze their data in AI Lab, create a model card, and create an app to solve their problem. Then, in the final project, students repeat these same steps with an issue they care about in their community.\n\n**Goals:**\n* Create machine learning models in AI Lab  from their own data and use App Lab to create an app that uses their model to solve problems in their community. \n\n\n**Big Questions:**\n- How can machine learning be used to solve problems in our community?\n\n:::\n\n\n::: details [**Implementation Guidance for the AI and Machine Learning Unit**]\n\n- Guidance for how to support students in programming levels and differentiate tasks are available in the [Programming Levels Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LlbzDHvq_DXggzeGg_sBcNov9pZX7h9NqardkGW4ELw/view) and [Differentiation Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10u5N7zCf52IZiSf4drQplEz3d3zS1iqWpegbBMDm0RQ/view)\n- You can view the full [Implementation Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sM_1Oxb7TGp5gSfuMjs0X0_Tko9tm8QJ4N6L26NI_iE/view) for more information about this unit\n:::\n\n::: details [**Professional Development**]\nIf you are interested in teaching this course, we recommend completing the free [AI/ML Self-Paced Professional Development Module](https://studio.code.org/courses/self-paced-pl-aiml-2023).

Using App Lab and Adafruit’s Circuit Playground, you’ll develop programs that utilize the same hardware inputs and outputs that you see in the smart devices, looking at how a simple rough prototype can lead to a finished product. The unit concludes with a design challenge to use the Circuit Playground as the basis for an innovation of your own design.

          description: |-
            These lessons supplement the [How AI Works](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNeehd1RXhnVMBFi1WhWLx_Y) video series. Each lesson is paired with a single video from the series, diving-deeper into the concepts introduced in the videos. Lessons focus on creating an exciting first experience for students, where students engage in an activity or simulation and then reflect on the experience as a way to build understanding around AI and build empathy with those impacted by it. Some lessons focus more on the technology behind AI, while other lessons focus on the societal impacts and ethical considerations of AI.

            **Supports for Teachers:** You can learn more about bringing AI lessons to your classroom through our [AI 101 for Teachers series](https://code.org/ai/pl/101). AI 101 for Teachers is a free, foundational online professional learning series for any teacher and educator interested in the groundbreaking world of artificial intelligence (AI) and its transformative potential in education.

            **Implementation Options:** Click one of the options below to expand and view more details.

            ::: details [<span style="font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold;">"I want to teach them all!"</span>]
            Lessons 1-7 can be taught as a 7-day sequence, where each day focuses on an individual video from the video series and dives deeper into the concepts introduced. Classrooms that go this direction should hide Lesson 8, which does not fit in this sequence.

            ::: details [<span style="font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold;">"I want to teach a specific lesson or integrate into another class"</span>]
            Each lesson can stand on its own and be taught independently from the others. This is especially useful if you would like to integrate a lesson into another subject or an existing computer science, artificial intelligence, or general education class. Classrooms that go this direction should hide all lessons except the one you want to teach.

            ::: details [<span style="font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold;">"I Only Have a Day"</span>]
            Lesson 8 is designed for classrooms that want to introduce AI to students, but only have a day to do so. This lesson provides a notetaker for students as the class watches the entire video sequence. Classrooms that go this direction should hide all lessons except for Lesson 8.

          description: |-
            In Web Development, students are empowered to create and share content on their own web pages. They begin by thinking about the role of the web and how it can be used as a medium for creative expression. As students develop their pages and begin to see themselves as programmers, they are encouraged to think critically about the impact of sharing information online and how to be more critical consumers of content. They are also introduced to problem solving as it relates to programming while they learn valuable skills such as debugging, using resources, and teamwork. At the conclusion of the unit, students will have created a personal website they can publish and share.

            ::: details [**Chapter 1 Overview**]
            **Description:** Students use computing as a form of self expression as they design and develop basic web pages.   Focusing on the tags, keywords, and syntax used to communicate instructions to the computer, students use HTML to structure the content of a web page. They also explore the privacy and intellectual property implications of publishing their work online.

            **Goals:**
            * Create digital artifacts that use multiple computer languages to control the structure and style of their content.
            * Create a website as a form of personal expression.
            * Use different programming languages to solve different problems.
            * Examine their role and responsibilities as both creators and consumers of digital media.

            **Big Questions:**
            * Why do people create websites?
            * How can text communicate content, structure, and style on a web page?
            * How do I safely and appropriately make use of the content published on the Internet?
            * What strategies can I use when coding to find and fix issues?
            :::

            ::: details [**Chapter 2 Overview**]
            **Description:** Students expand their ideas of websites beyond personal expression and begin to see them as a way to solve problems.  Students build on their collaborative skills and work in teams to create multi-page websites that solve a problem.

            **Goals:**
            * Create digital artifacts that use multiple computer languages to control the structure and style of their content.
            * Create a website that solves a problem.
            * Use different programming languages to solve different problems.
            * Examine their role and responsibilities as both creators and consumers of digital media.

            **Big Questions:**
            * How can websites be used to address problems in the world?
            * What strategies can teams use to work better together?
            * How do I know what information can be trusted online?

          description: "In the Interactive Animations and Games unit, students create programmatic images, animations, interactive art, and games. Starting off with simple, primitive shapes and building up to more sophisticated sprite-based games, students become familiar with the programming concepts and the design process computer scientists use daily. They then learn how these simpler constructs can be combined to create more complex programs. In the final project, students develop a personalized, interactive program.\n\n::: details [**Chapter 1 Overview**]\n**Description:** Students build up toward programming interactive animations in the Game Lab environment.  They begin with simple shapes and sprite objects, then use loops to create flipbook style animations.  Next, they learn to use booleans and conditionals to respond to user input.  At the end of the chapter, students design and create an interactive animation that they can share with the world.\n\n**Goals:**\n* Create an interactive animation that includes basic programming concepts such as control structures, variables, user input, and randomness. \n* Give and respond constructively to peer feedback, and work with their teammates to complete a project. \n* View yourself as a computer programmer, and see programming as a fun and creative form of expression.\n\n\n**Big Questions:**\n* What is a computer program?\n* What are the core features of most programming languages?\n* How does programming enable creativity and individual expression?\n* What practices and strategies will help me as I write programs?\n:::\n\n::: details [**Chapter 2 Overview**]\n**Description:** In this chapter students combine the constructs that they learned in the first chapter to program more complex movement and collisions in their sprites.  As they create more complex programs, they begin to use functions to organize their code.  In the end, students use a design process to create an original game.\n\n**Goals:**\n* Create an interactive game that includes basic programming concepts such as control structures, variables, user input, and randomness. \n* Give and respond constructively to peer feedback, and work with their teammates to complete a project. \n* Work with others to break down programming projects using sprites and functions.\n\n**Big Questions:**\n* How do software developers manage complexity and scale?\n* How can programs be organized so that common problems only need to be solved once?\n* How can I build on previous solutions to create even more complex behavior?\n:::\n\n::: details [**Implementation Guidance for Interactive Animations and Games**]\n- Guidance for how to support students in programming levels and differentiate tasks are available in the [Programming Levels Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LlbzDHvq_DXggzeGg_sBcNov9pZX7h9NqardkGW4ELw/view) and [Differentiation Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10u5N7zCf52IZiSf4drQplEz3d3zS1iqWpegbBMDm0RQ/view)\n- You can view the [Implementation Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sM_1Oxb7TGp5gSfuMjs0X0_Tko9tm8QJ4N6L26NI_iE/view) for more information about this unit\n:::\n\n## Finished Teaching This Unit?\nAnswer this [**short survey**](https://studio.code.org/form/teacher_csd_unit_survey?survey_data%5Bunit_number%5D=3) to let the Code.org curriculum team know how the unit went."

          description: "This unit explores the technical challenges and questions that arise from the need to represent digital information in computers. Learn how complex information like numbers, text, images, and sound are represented in bits, how compression works, and the broader social impacts of digitizing the world's information.\n\n*(Click the arrows below to expand)*\n\n::: details [**\U0001F9D0 Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy**]\n\n####Establishing a Strong Classroom Culture\n This unit is designed to be hands-on, collaborative, and exploratory. A major focus of the unit is building a positive classroom culture in which students work together, explore problems, and communicate about their thinking. Most lessons either feature physical manipulatives or a digital widget, and the bulk of lesson time should be spent with students exploring these tools together to develop an understanding of the concepts they highlight. The course intentionally does not start with programming since, in many classrooms, some students have experience with programming and others do not. Choosing to begin with digital information and the internet lets you build community in the room while exploring a topic that is likely to be accessible to all students. The supportive and inclusive classroom environment built in this unit should help set a positive tone that can be carried through the school year.\n\n\n####Empowering \"Deciders\"\n An important goal of the course is not merely to teach students technical knowledge, but to put those skills to work in meaningful ways. This unit builds towards the unit project, which provides an opportunity for students to be \"deciders\" about the impacts of computing on modern life. Other units will emphasize empowering units as \"creators.\"\n:::\n\n\n\n::: details [**⭐️ Major Assessment and Projects**]\n\n&nbsp\n\nThe unit project asks students to consider and debate issues that arise in modern society due to the digitizing of information. Students will analyze an article that addresses the intersection of digitizing information and current events. They will evaluate what data is being digitized and evaluate the benefits and harms caused by making this information digital. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\n::: details [**✅ AP Connections**]\n&nbsp\n\nThis unit and its associated project help build towards the enduring understandings listed below. For a detailed mapping of units to Learning Objectives and EKs, please see the \"Standards\" page for this unit.\n\n* DAT-1: The way a computer represents data internally is different from the way the data is interpreted and displayed for the user. Programs are used to translate data into a representation more easily understood by people.\n* IOC-1: while computing innovations are typically designed to achieve a specific purpose, they may have unintended consequences\n\nThis unit includes content from the following topics from the AP CS Principles Framework. For more detailed information on topic coverage in the course review [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l9VDL92DCIbTNhTiLGIr-enBOTM4wEDTTQOBlJ7bBhM/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n* 2.1 Binary Numbers\n* 2.2 Data Compression\n* 5.5 Legal and Ethical Concerns.\n:::\n\n## Finished Teaching This Unit?\nAnswer this [**short survey**](https://studio.code.org/form/teacher_csp_unit_survey?survey_data%5Bunit_number%5D=1) to let the Code.org curriculum team know how the unit went."

Then consider the impacts the Internet has had, both good and bad, on modern life.\n\n::: details [**\U0001F9D0 Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy**]\n####Inventing the Internet with the Internet Simulator\n \nThis unit features many different versions of the Internet Simulator, a digital widget that simulates how different features or \"layers\" of the Internet work. As students move from lesson to lesson, the version of the Internet Simulator they use will have slightly more functionality than the last. Lessons will present students with challenges that closely mimic those that the internet's original inventors needed to solve. Students will collaboratively design and test solutions to those problems to develop an intuitive understanding of how the internet works and why it was designed that way. By the end of the unit, students will have \"invented the internet\" themselves! \n\n####Continuing to Establish a Strong Classroom Culture\nMuch like the Digital Information unit that comes before it, this unit emphasizes collaborative problem solving and developing a supportive and inclusive classroom culture. \n:::\n\n::: details [**⭐️ Major Assessment and Projects**]\n\n&nbsp\nThe unit project asks students to design a policy position for an imaginary political candidate related to an \"Internet Dilemma.\" Students must analyze news stories about their topic to identify impacted groups, explain those groups' interests, explain technical background about the dilemma, and then recommend a policy solution that the candidate should advocate for.

Learn how to design user interfaces and write event-driven programs in App Lab and then design a project that teaches your classmates about a topic of your choosing.\n\n\n::: details [**\U0001F9D0 Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy**]\n\n ####New Topics, Same Classroom Culture\nThis unit is students' first experience with programming. It is designed to maintain the collaborative and inclusive classroom environment developed in the previous two units. The collaborative project, fun, unplugged activities, and the focus on experimenting should help keep your whole class working together and trying out ideas. \n\n####Emphasizing Skills \nSince this is the first of many programming units, it emphasizes attitudes and skills that will serve your students well for the remainder of the year. The project that runs through this unit emphasizes that programming is a creative and collaborative endeavor that students can use to help others. Key practices like pair programming and debugging help normalize working with a partner, asking for help, and making mistakes. While students have a lot to learn about programming and App Lab, there is just as much emphasis on establishing these positive habits and mindsets. \n\n####Empowering \"Creators\"\nThis unit empowers students to be creators with a major emphasis on making personally meaningful apps. Students have a lot to learn about programming. Still, the goal is for students to come away from this unit, seeing programming as a powerful form of personal expression that allows them to draw on their innate talents and interests to help solve problems in their community.\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: details [**⭐️ Major Assessment and Projects**]\n\n&nbsp\n\nThe unit project asks students to collaborate with a classmate to design an app that can teach others about a topic of shared interest. Students practice interviewing classmates to identify the project's goals, mockup designs, collaboratively program the app and run simple user tests. The app itself must include at least three screens and demonstrate what students have learned about user interface design and event-driven programming. Students submit their app, project guide, and written responses to reflection questions about how the app is designed and the development process used to make it. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\n::: details [**✅ AP Connections**]\n&nbsp\n\nThis unit and unit project helps build towards the enduring understandings listed below. For a detailed mapping of units to Learning Objectives and EKs, please see the \"Standards\" page for this unit.\n\n* CRD-1: incorporating multiple perspectives through collaboration improves computing innovations as they are developed.\n* CRD-2: developers create and innovate using an iterative design process that is user-focused, that incorporates implementation/feedback cycles, and that leaves ample room for experimentation and risk-taking.\n* AAP-2: The way statements are sequenced and combined in a program determines the computed result. Programs incorporate iteration and selection constructs to represent repetition and make decisions to handle varied input values.\n* AAP-3: Programmers break down problems into smaller and more manageable pieces. By creating procedures and leveraging parameters, programmers generalize processes that can be reused. Procedures allow programmers to draw upon existing code that has already been tested, allowing them to write programs more quickly and with more confidence.\n\nThis unit includes content from the following topics from the AP CS Principles Framework. For more detailed information on topic coverage in the course review [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l9VDL92DCIbTNhTiLGIr-enBOTM4wEDTTQOBlJ7bBhM/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n* 1.1 Collaboration\n* 1.2 Program Function and Purpose\n* 1.3 Program Design and Development\n\nThe College Board has supplied formative Create PT questions to help prepare students to complete the Create Task. We recommend that students complete the following prompts with the unit project. More information can be found in Code.org CS Principles Topic Coverage.\n\n* 3.a.i.\n* 3.a.ii.\n* 3.a.iii\n\n:::\n\n\n## Finished Teaching This Unit?\nAnswer this [**short survey**](https://studio.code.org/form/teacher_csp_unit_survey?survey_data%5Bunit_number%5D=3) to let the Code.org curriculum team know how the unit went."

          description: "This unit expands on the object-oriented programming principles introduced in Unit 1 to explore design principles as students develop classes with attributes and behaviors and work with primitive and object data. Students learn to write no-argument constructors to assign default values and parameterized constructors to assign specific values to an object's instance variables. They explore how the `this` keyword can be used to reduce ambiguity and redundancies in their program and how the `super` keyword can be used to call a superclass constructor or method. Students also learn how to work with variables and write expressions using arithmetic and compound assignment operators and practice tracing code segments to determine the output. After working with instance variables and constructors, they write accessor and mutator methods to work with the values assigned to an object's instance variables and `toString()` methods to display information about an object to the console.

          description: "This unit explores how variables, conditionals, and functions allow for the design of increasingly complex apps. Learn how to program with these three new concepts through a sequence of collaborative activities. Then build your own decision maker app to share with friends and help them make a decision.\n\n::: details [**\U0001F9D0 Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy**]\n\n#### Intro to EIPM\n\nThis unit is students' first experience with the Explore, Investigate, Practice, Make lesson sequence, or EIPM. This structured approach to teaching programming is covered in detail in the curriculum guide. We highly recommend watching the [accompanying video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNeqEl6MN7c2KyM3gdBSo8t3) to better understand what EIPM should look like in the classroom. When used effectively, it supports deep learning of content and helps maintain a collaborative classroom culture, even as you move into more complex programming concepts.\n\n####Scaffolding Towards Independent Projects \n\nA major goal of this course is to empower students to design and build projects independently. The Create PT in Unit 8 offers students enormous freedom to scope and build projects, and even this unit begins scaffolding towards that goal. Individual EIPM sequences of lessons gradually prepare students for scoped, independent Make projects. The unit project has a few requirements, but students are largely free to choose the design, topic, and implementation of their ideas. As you teach the unit, look for the opportunities to scaffold the skills and knowledge students will need to creatively and independently tackle the unit project.\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\n::: details [**⭐️ Major Assessment and Projects**]\n\n&nbsp\n\nThe unit project asks students to design an app that makes a recommendation based on information from user input. Students are given a great deal of freedom to choose their topic, design their user interface, and decide how to actually program their app's behavior. Students submit their app, project guide, and written responses to reflection questions about how the app is designed and the development process they used to make it. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\n::: details [**✅ AP Connections**]\n\n\n&nbsp\n\nThis unit and unit project helps build towards the enduring understandings listed below. For a detailed mapping of units to Learning Objectives and EKs, please see the \"Standards\" page for this unit.\n\n* CRD-2: Developers create and innovate using an iterative design process that is user-focused, that incorporates implementation/feedback cycles, and that leaves ample room for experimentation and risk-taking.\n* AAP-1: To find specific solutions to generalizable problems, programmers represent and organize data in multiple ways.\n* AAP-2: The way statements are sequenced and combined in a program determines the computed result. Programs incorporate iteration and selection constructs to represent repetition and make decisions to handle varied input values.\n* AAP-3: Programmers break down problems into smaller and more manageable pieces. By creating procedures and leveraging parameters, programmers generalize processes that can be reused. Procedures allow programmers to draw upon existing code that has already been tested, allowing them to write programs more quickly and with more confidence.\n\nThis unit includes content from the following topics from the AP CS Principles Framework. For more detailed information on topic coverage in the course review [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l9VDL92DCIbTNhTiLGIr-enBOTM4wEDTTQOBlJ7bBhM/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n* 1.4 Identifying and Correcting Errors\n* 3.1 Variables and Assignment\n* 3.3 Mathematical Expressions\n* 3.5 Boolean Expressions\n* 3.6 Conditionals\n* 3.7 Nested Conditionals\n* 3.15 Random Values\n\nThe College Board has supplied formative Create PT questions to help prepare students to complete the Create Task. We recommend that students complete the following prompts with the unit project. More information can be found in Code.org CS Principles Topic Coverage.\n\n* 3.a.i.\n* 3.a.ii.\n* 3.a.iii\n:::\n\n## Finished Teaching This Unit?\nAnswer this [**short survey**](https://studio.code.org/form/teacher_csp_unit_survey?survey_data%5Bunit_number%5D=4) to let the Code.org curriculum team know how the unit went."

Learn how to use data visualization to find patterns inside of data sets and learn how this data analysis process is being used in contexts like open data or machine learning to help make decisions or learn more about our world. In the unit project, you'll analyze a dataset of your choosing and present your findings. \n\n::: details [**\U0001F9D0 Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy**]\n\n####The Data Analysis Process\nThis unit is built around a data analysis process that helps students break down how data is turned into new information about the world. Some lessons are designed around different steps of this process, like cleaning data or building visualizations. Other lessons focus on ways this process is applied in real-world contexts like citizen science or machine learning. The data analysis process helps provide a consistent reference point as students explore the importance of data analysis in computing. \n\n####Exploring Data with the Data Visualizer\nThe Data Visualizer is a tool built into App Lab that allows students to quickly create visualizations of the data they've added to their projects. The set of possible visualizations is intentionally limited to a few ways to change or modify the chart. This tool aims to encourage exploring the different kinds of questions that can be answered with data visualizations, with a greater emphasis on students' ability to create a variety of visualizations quickly. This exploration should also help students build more meaningful and powerful apps in future units when they start using these datasets in their programs.\n:::\n\n::: details [**⭐️ Major Assessment and Projects**]\n&nbsp\n\nStudents use the data visualizer to find and present a data story. Using what they've learned about the data analysis process, students either choose a dataset inside the data library or upload one of their own and create visualizations that find interesting patterns that may reveal new insights and knowledge. Students complete an activity guide describing their findings and the process they used in identifying them. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n:::\n\n::: details [**✅ AP Connections**]\n&nbsp\n\nThis unit and unit project helps build towards the enduring understandings listed below.

          description: "This unit introduces lists, loops, and traversals, and explores the way they can be used to build apps that store and process large amounts of information. Learn to program with the data library in App Lab and complete a 5-day hackathon project at the end of the unit where you can design a program about any topic of your choosing.\n\n::: details [**\U0001F9D0 Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy**]\n\n####Independent Creation and The Hackathon Project\nMuch like the project in Unit 4, the \"Hackathon\" project in this unit is designed as an opportunity for students to creatively and independently build something with their programming skills. While students are asked to include some technical requirements in their program to ensure they demonstrate mastery of new programming concepts, they have free rein to choose the goals, design, and implementation of their project. To avoid asking students to complete a major programming project right before the Create PT, this hackathon is the most \"Create-PT-like\" project of the course. It is the best chance for students to practice skills like budgeting time or scoping an open-ended project. In many classrooms, if you maintain the recommended pacing of the course, this project serves as an excellent end to the first semester.\n\n####Growing Comfort with EIPM\nBy this unit, students (and teachers!) should be developing greater comfort with the flow of EIPM lessons. Students may begin to anticipate that sequences build towards an independent Make lesson or look forward to stepping away from computers to Explore. A nice feature of EIPM is that you will find strategies and modifications to each lesson type that work best for your students. Keep an eye out for how you and your students are developing comfort with EIPM and note strategies that help meet your classroom's needs.\n\n####Programming with Real-world Data\nThe Data Library is a feature in App Lab designed to let students program with data from the real world. This tool aims to motivate students to build new kinds of data-powered apps that they find personally interesting. This tool also facilitates programming with lists of information since students will need to manipulate lists of data to incorporate the different data sources. Encourage students to use datasets they find personally relevant as they draw on their creative ideas for bringing data to life.\n:::\n\n\n\n::: details [**⭐️ Major Assessment and Projects**]\nThe unit project asks students to spend five days as part of a \"Hackathon\" project that they have nearly complete independence to scope and design. Students must choose one dataset from the Data Library in AppLab to be a component of their project to demonstrate what they have learned about lists and list processing; otherwise, scoping the project is completely up to them. Students submit their app, project guide, and written responses to reflection questions about how the app is designed and the development process they used to make it. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n:::\n\n\n::: details [**✅ AP Connections**]\n&nbsp\n\nThis unit and unit project helps build towards the enduring understandings listed below.

End the unit by designing a library of functions around any topic of your choosing.\n\n::: details [**\U0001F9D0 Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy**]\n\n####Learning by Building Libraries\nIn the second EIPM sequence of this unit, students learn to use the Student-Create Libraries tool in App Lab. This tool allows them to build and share libraries of functions that they can use in many different projects. This tool serves many purposes besides simply teaching students about libraries. By having to write functions that other students find useful, they will need to think about common patterns or situations that they have seen in projects across the course. Students will also practice commenting their code so others can understand how it works, practice designing functions that use parameters and return.  \n\n####Final Preparation for the Create PT\nStudents learn very few new concepts in this unit; nevertheless, it can be challenging because students need to learn how to integrate the ideas of parameters and return with every other concept they have learned in this course. This unit presents a good opportunity to do a final review of every programming construct covered in the course as students prepare to demonstrate what they've learned on the Create PT.\n:::\n\n\n\n::: details [**⭐️ Major Assessment and Projects**]\n&nbsp\n\nThe unit project asks students to design a library of functions that they can share with classmates. Their library must contain at least two functions, and at least one of those functions must include a parameter, return, a loop, and an if-statement. This requirement ensures students practice skills they will use in the Create PT. Using a project guide, students choose a theme for their library, build it, test it, and exchange feedback with other students. Students submit their library code, project guide, and written responses to reflection questions about how the app is designed and the development process they used to make it. They will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n\n\n:::\n\n\n::: details [**✅ AP Connections**]\n&nbsp\n\nThis unit and unit project helps build towards the enduring understandings listed below.

It helps contextualize what students are learning by moving from abstract ideas of privacy or security to concrete potential innovations. Since the simulation is based on modernizing schools, students can consider the consequences of computing innovations in a familiar setting. By taking on an assigned role and interacting with a group of teammates who have done the same, students must consider a breadth of interests and goals beyond their own when it comes to innovating in schools. \n\n####Ending the Year as \"Deciders\"\nA major theme students engage with throughout this unit is the need to consider both sides of technological innovation. Computing technology has led to both benefits and harms to culture, economy, and society at large. Responding to important questions facing our world requires understanding technology and an ability to identify and interpret the impacts it causes. This unit is not designed to advocate for any particular point of view on the impact of technology. Still, it should empower students to adeptly see and weigh the consequences of the technology around them. While the Create PT may feel like the most significant project of this course, the Explore Curricular requirement and the questions faced in this unit are arguably more crucial. Many of the young people who take CS Principles may pursue studies or careers in which they are \"creators\" with technology, but all of them will need to be thoughtful \"deciders\" in a world profoundly shaped by computing. \n:::\n\n\n\n::: details [**⭐️ Major Assessment and Projects**]\n&nbsp\n\nStudents complete the Future School Convention simulation throughout this unit. Working in teams of roughly five people, students are assigned a role and a set of interests they'll need to investigate. They research real-world innovations that could improve schools and align with the interests of their character. Throughout the unit, they are given opportunities to refine their proposals as a team and debate the benefits and risks of different computing innovations. Eventually, their team submits an overall proposal for the Future School, and all students vote for the team and innovation they believe to be the best. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with the CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n:::\n\n\n::: details [**✅ AP Connections**]\n&nbsp\nThis unit and unit project helps build towards the enduring understandings listed below.

          title: Class Structure and Design
          description: "This unit expands on the object-oriented programming principles introduced in Unit 1 to explore design principles as students develop classes with attributes and behaviors and work with primitive and object data. Students learn to write no-argument constructors to assign default values and parameterized constructors to assign specific values to an object's instance variables. They explore how the `this` keyword can be used to reduce ambiguity and redundancies in their program and how the `super` keyword can be used to call a superclass constructor or method. Students also learn how to work with variables and write expressions using arithmetic and compound assignment operators and practice tracing code segments to determine the output. After working with instance variables and constructors, they write accessor and mutator methods to work with the values assigned to an object's instance variables and `toString()` methods to display information about an object to the console. Throughout this unit, students continue to develop software engineering skills as they learn to make design decisions and use inheritance to create class hierarchies.\n\n<details style=\"padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">\n    <summary style=\"font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;\">\U0001F3AF Unit Objectives</summary>\n    <div style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;\">\n        <p><strong><em>By the end of this unit, students will be able to . . .</em></strong></p>\n\n* Represent attributes of an object using instance variables\n\n* Write no-argument and parameterized constructors to set the state of an object\n\n* Use the `super` keyword to refer to the superclass in constructors and methods\n\n* Write expressions using arithmetic operators and compound assignment operators with variables and object data\n\n* Write accessor and mutator methods to obtain and modify object data\n\n* Write `toString()` methods and use escape sequences to display and format information about an object to the console\n    </div>\n</details>\n\n<details style=\"padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">\n    <summary style=\"font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;\">✅ AP Classroom Personal Progress Checks</summary>\n    <div style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;\">\n        <p>To assign questions from the AP Classroom Question Bank that align with this unit, create a custom quiz in AP Classroom by searching the Question Bank for the Essential Knowledge statements on the unit's <a href=\"https://studio.code.org/s/csa2-2023/standards\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Standards</strong></a> page.

            ## How to navigate these lessons

            1) Start with Lesson A. This is the world we're in now.
            2) **Go to Lesson F - the last lesson in the progression!** This represents a world where lessons are entirely connected to slides at every step of the way with everything in the table itself.
            3) All the lessons in between are a "progression" from one world to the next, gradually introducing ways tables and slides could appear in lessons.

            **Ignore weird image sizing in tables**. This is a markdown thing and, if we go more in a slide-image direction, we can find a way to figure out image sizes so they'll all be the same even in separate tables.

            If you can't ignore the weird sizing, open up the developer console in a lesson and paste this into the javascript console:
            ```
            document.querySelectorAll('tr').forEach(row => { const cells = row.querySelectorAll('td, th'); if (cells.length > 0) cells[0].style.width = '25%'; if (cells.length > 1) cells[1].style.width = '75%'; });
            ```

            This will resize all of the tables to be the same size

          title: Web Development ('24-'25)
          description: |-
            In Web Development, students are put in the shoes of a web developer and empowered to design and create a web page to meet a user’s needs. As students develop the pages and begin to see themselves as web developers and designers, they are encouraged to think critically about the impact of sharing information online and how to be more critical consumers of content. They are also introduced to problem-solving related to programming while learning valuable skills such as debugging, using resources, and teamwork. At the conclusion of chapter one, students will design and create a web page for a user. After chapter two, students will have worked with a team to create a multi-page website they can publish and share.

            ::: details [**Chapter 1 Overview**]
            **Description:** Students work as web developers to design and develop web pages to meet users' needs. Focusing on the tags, keywords, and syntax used to communicate instructions to the computer, students use HTML to structure the content of a web page and CSS to design and organize the content. They also explore the privacy and intellectual property implications of publishing web pages online.

            **Goals:**
            * Create digital artifacts that use multiple computer languages to control the structure and style of their content.
            * Create a web page to meet a user's needs.
            * Use different programming languages to solve different problems.
            * Examine their role and responsibilities as creators and consumers of digital media.

            **Big Questions:**
            * How do web developers create web pages for users?
            * How can text communicate a web page's content, structure, and style?
            * How do I safely and appropriately make use of the content published on the Internet?
            * What strategies can I use when coding to find and fix issues?
            :::

            ::: details [**Chapter 2 Overview**]
            **Description:** Students expand their ideas of websites beyond personal expression and begin to see them as a way to solve problems.  Students build on their collaborative skills and work in teams to create multi-page websites that solve a problem.

            **Goals:**
            * Create digital artifacts that use multiple computer languages to control the structure and style of their content.
            * Create a website that solves a problem.
            * Use different programming languages to solve different problems.
            * Examine their role and responsibilities as both creators and consumers of digital media.

            **Big Questions:**
            * How can websites be used to address problems in the world?
            * What strategies can teams use to work better together?
            * How do I know what information can be trusted online?

            ##Unit Overview

            This unit aims to build a foundational understanding of text-based generative AI models, focusing on core concepts over technical skills. Students will demystify generative AI models by exploring their internal structures through the familiar lens of input, storage, process, and output. They will gain insights into how these models represent language, the impact of training data on model performance, and the potential for bias. Using this knowledge they will be presented with scenarios throughout the unit where they can help educate individuals who feel powerless or lack agency in how AI is impacting their lives, or respond to individuals who have only read the hype headlines and offer feedback or criticism based on their knowledge of how these AI systems work.

          description: "The Design Process unit transitions students from thinking about computer science as a tool to solve their own problems towards considering the broader social impacts of computing. Through a series of design challenges, students are asked to consider and understand the needs of others while developing a solution to a problem. The second half of the unit consists of an iterative team project, during which students have the opportunity to identify a need that they care about, prototype solutions both on paper and in App Lab, and test their solutions with real users to get feedback and drive further iteration.\n\n::: details [**Chapter 1 Overview**]\n**Description:** This chapter introduces the design process as a specific version of the problem solving process in which empathy for a user's needs is consistently integrated. Students learn strategies for identifying user needs and assessing how well different designs address them.

          description: "The Design Process unit transitions students from thinking about computer science as a tool to solve their own problems towards considering the broader social impacts of computing. Through a series of design challenges, students are asked to consider and understand the needs of others while developing a solution to a problem. The second half of the unit consists of an iterative team project, during which students have the opportunity to identify a need that they care about, prototype solutions both on paper and in App Lab, and test their solutions with real users to get feedback and drive further iteration.\n\n::: details [**Chapter 1 Overview**]\n**Description:** This chapter introduces the design process as a specific version of the problem solving process in which empathy for a user's needs is consistently integrated. Students learn strategies for identifying user needs and assessing how well different designs address them. In particular they learn how to develop a paper prototype, how to gather and respond to feedback about a prototype, and consider ways different user interfaces do or do not affect the usability of their apps.\n\n**Goals:** \n* See the design process as a form of problem solving that prioritizes the needs of a user. \n* Identify user needs and assess how well different designs address them. \n* Develop paper prototypes, gather and respond to feedback about a prototype, and consider ways different user interfaces do or do not affect the usability of their apps. \n\n**Big Questions:**\n* How do designers identify the needs of their user?\n* How can we ensure that a user's needs are met by our designs?\n* What processes will best allow us to efficiently create, test, and iterate upon our designs?\n:::\n\n::: details [**Chapter 2 Overview**]\n**Description:** This chapter is focused on a long running group project that allows students to apply all they've learned about User-Centered Design to develop an app prototype. Working in teams, students identify a social issue that they care about and design and prototype an app to address that issue. This is an opportunity for students to explore other roles in software development, such as product management, marketing, design, and testing.\n\n\n**Goals:**\n* Develop digital prototypes, gather and respond to feedback about a prototype, and consider ways different user interfaces do or do not affect the usability of their apps. \n* Understand other roles in software development, such as product management, marketing, design, and testing, and how to use what they have learned about computer science as a tool for social impact.\n\n**Big Questions:**\n* How do teams effectively work together to develop software?\n* What roles beyond programming are necessary to design and develop software?\n* How do designers incorporate feedback into multiple iterations of a product?\n:::\n\n::: details [**Implementation Guidance for The Design Process**]\n- You can view the [Implementation Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sM_1Oxb7TGp5gSfuMjs0X0_Tko9tm8QJ4N6L26NI_iE/view) for more information about this unit\n:::\n\n## Finished Teaching This Unit?\nAnswer this [**short survey**](https://studio.code.org/form/teacher_csd_unit_survey?survey_data%5Bunit_number%5D=4) to let the Code.org curriculum team know how the unit went."

          description: |-
            The Data and Society unit is about the importance of using data to solve problems and it highlights how computers can help in this process. The first chapter explores different systems used to represent information in a computer and the challenges and tradeoffs posed by using them. In the second chapter, students learn how collections of data are used to solve problems, and how computers help to automate the steps of this process. In the final project, students gather their own data and use it to develop an automated solution to a problem.


            ::: details [**Chapter 1 Overview**]
            **Description:** Students explore how data can be used to answer interesting questions and solve problems.  Using a modified version of the general Problem Solving Process, students look at how computers and humans use data differently and the pros and cons of automating problem solving.  After learning ways that computers use data in the real world, students choose their own problem and use data to address it.


            **Goals:**
            * Investigate and understand how humans and computers use data differently.
            * Design and implement a data-based solution to a given problem and determine how the different aspects of the problem solving process could be automated.



            **Big Questions:**
            * How does data help us to solve problems?
            * How do computers and humans use data differently?
            * What parts of the data problem solving process can be automated?
            * What kinds of problems do computers use data to solve in the real world?

            This unit introduces students to the fundamentals, applications, and ethical implications of computer vision technologies. The unit starts with basic concepts and gradually builds up to complex topics, including data collection, model training, prototype development, and the integration of user feedback. Each lesson is designed to enhance students' understanding through hands-on activities and discussions culminating in the development of a prototype. The curriculum emphasizes critical thinking, problem-solving, and ethical considerations, equipping students with the skills to develop and evaluate technology that addresses real-world problems. Through iterative design and user-centered approaches, students not only learn the technical aspects of computer vision but also its impact on society, preparing them to be thoughtful innovators in a rapidly advancing technological landscape.

            ## What do I need to teach this module?

            Take a look at the [**Getting Started with Computer Vision**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G5NztlmSlZ3pAN09mnze1eGzuLXQVvVjoqzTHqeEgk0/edit?usp=sharing) for information about what you and your students will need for this module.

            ## How can I prepare to teach this module?

            If you are interested in teaching this module, we recommend completing the free [**Computer Vision Self-Paced Professional Development Module**](http://studio.code.org/courses/self-paced-pl-computer-vision-2024). The module is designed to take 2-3 hours to complete. No previous computer science experience is required.
          student_description: In this unit, you'll dive into how computers interpret and understand visual information from the world around us. You'll start with the basics of how images are captured and processed and move on to more complex topics like training data, model development, and the ethical implications of artificial intelligence. Through a series of interactive lessons, hands-on activities, and project-based learning, you'll get to design your own computer vision app. Along the way, you'll learn not only about the technology itself but also how it can be used responsibly to make a positive impact in various fields like healthcare, automotive, and public safety.

            #####We've compiled a list of all of our unplugged lessons for you to use in your classroom. Now you can teach the fundamentals of computer science, whether you have computers in your classroom or not!

            <img src="https://images.code.org/8f9ecd6897039d861bccd67cd60a16c4-image-1721339529551.jpg" width=450px style="float:right; margin-left:30px">

            #####We refer to lessons in which students are not working on a computer as “unplugged.” Students will often work with pencil and paper or physical manipulatives. These are intentionally placed kinesthetic opportunities that help students digest complicated concepts in ways that relate to their own lives.

            #####Unplugged lessons are particularly useful for building and maintaining a collaborative classroom environment, and they are useful touchstone experiences you can refer to when introducing more abstract concepts. Each of these activities can either be used alone or with other computer science lessons on related concepts.

          title: Class Structure and Design
          description_audience: ''
          description_short: Students develop an understanding of data encapsulation and object-oriented design decisions.
          description: "This unit expands on the object-oriented programming principles introduced in Unit 1 to explore design principles as students develop classes with attributes and behaviors and work with primitive and object data. Students learn to write no-argument constructors to assign default values and parameterized constructors to assign specific values to an object's instance variables. They explore how the `this` keyword can be used to reduce ambiguity and redundancies in their program and how the `super` keyword can be used to call a superclass constructor or method. Students also learn how to work with variables and write expressions using arithmetic and compound assignment operators and practice tracing code segments to determine the output. After working with instance variables and constructors, they write accessor and mutator methods to work with the values assigned to an object's instance variables and `toString()` methods to display information about an object to the console. Throughout this unit, students continue to develop software engineering skills as they learn to make design decisions and use inheritance to create class hierarchies.\n\n<details style=\"padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">\n    <summary style=\"font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;\">\U0001F3AF Unit Objectives</summary>\n    <div style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;\">\n        <p><strong><em>By the end of this unit, students will be able to . . .</em></strong></p>\n\n* Represent attributes of an object using instance variables\n\n* Write no-argument and parameterized constructors to set the state of an object\n\n* Use the `super` keyword to refer to the superclass in constructors and methods\n\n* Write expressions using arithmetic operators and compound assignment operators with variables and object data\n\n* Write accessor and mutator methods to obtain and modify object data\n\n* Write `toString()` methods and use escape sequences to display and format information about an object to the console\n    </div>\n</details>\n\n<details style=\"padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">\n    <summary style=\"font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;\">✅ AP Classroom Personal Progress Checks</summary>\n    <div style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;\">\n        <p>To assign questions from the AP Classroom Question Bank that align with this unit, create a custom quiz in AP Classroom by searching the Question Bank for the Essential Knowledge statements on the unit's <a href=\"https://studio.code.org/s/csa2-2023/standards\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Standards</strong></a> page.

Students use decomposition strategies and object-oriented principles to plan and implement their ideas while ensuring their projects meet specified requirements. In the process, students learn to write `private`, overloaded, and overridden methods and use the `super` keyword in a subclass method to call a superclass method while exploring the functionality of methods and their parameters.
