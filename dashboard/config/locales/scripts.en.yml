              description_student: The class learns about collision detection on the computer.  Pairs explore how a computer could use sprite location and size properties and math to detect whether two sprites are touching.  The class then uses the isTouching() block to create different effects when sprites collide, including playing sounds.  Last, they use their new skills to improve the sidescroller game that they started in the last lesson.

In the final levels the class combine these movements to animate and control a single sprite and build a simple game in which a character flies around and collects coins. '
              description_teacher: Students learn to combine the velocity properties of sprites with the counter pattern to create more complex sprite movement. In particular students will learn how to simulate gravity, make a sprite jump, and allow a sprite to float left or right. In the final levels of the Code Studio progression students combine these movements to animate and control a single sprite and build a simple game in which a character flies around and collects a coin. Students are encouraged to make their own additions to the game in the final level.
            Collisions:
              name: Collisions
              description_student: The class programs their sprites to interact in new ways.  After a brief review of how they used the isTouching block, the class brainstorms other ways that two sprites could interact.  They then use isTouching to make one sprite push another across the screen before practicing with the four collision blocks (collide, displace, bounce, and bounceOff).
              description_teacher: Students program their sprites to interact in new ways.  After a brief review of how they used the `isTouching` block, students brainstorm other ways that two sprites could interact.  They then use `isTouching` to make one sprite push another across the screen before practicing with the four collision blocks (`collide`, `displace`, `bounce`, and `bounceOff`).
            Functions:
              name: Functions
              description_student: This lesson covers functions as a way to organize their code, make it more readable, and remove repeated blocks of code. The class learns that higher level or more abstract steps make it easier to understand and reason about steps, then begins to create functions in Game Lab.  At the end of the lesson the class uses these skills to organize and add functionality to the final version of their side scroller game.
              description_teacher: Students learn how to create functions to organize their code, make it more readable, and remove repeated blocks of code. An unplugged warmup explores how directions at different levels of detail can be useful depending on context. Students learn that higher level or more abstract steps make it easier to understand and reason about steps. Afterwards students learn to create functions in Game Lab. They will use functions to remove long blocks of code from their draw loop and to replace repeated pieces of code with a single function. At the end of the lesson students use these skills to organize and add functionality to the final version of their side scroller game.
            The Game Design Process:
              name: The Game Design Process
              description_student: This lesson introduces the process the class will use to design games for the remainder of the unit. The class walks through through this process in a series of levels. As part of this lesson the class also briefly learn to use multi-frame animations in Game Lab. At the end of the lesson they have an opportunity to make improvements to the game to make it their own.
              description_teacher: This lesson introduces students to the process they will use to design games for the remainder of the unit. This process is centered around a project guide which asks students to define their sprites, variables, and functions before they begin programming their game. In this lesson students begin by playing a game on Game Lab where the code is hidden. They discuss what they think the sprites, variables, and functions would need to be to make the game. They are then given a completed project guide which shows one way to implement the game. Students are then walked through this process through a series of levels. As part of this lesson students also briefly learn to use multi-frame animations in Game Lab. At the end of the lesson students have an opportunity to make improvements to the game to make it their own.
            Using the Game Design Process:
              name: Using the Game Design Process
              description_student: In this multi-day lesson, the class uses the problem solving process from Unit 1 to create a platform jumper game.  After looking at a sample game, the class defines what their games will look like and uses a structured process to build them.  Finally, the class reflects on how the games could be improved, and implements those changes.
              description_teacher: In this multi-day lesson, students use the problem solving process from Unit 1 to create a platform jumper game.  They start by looking at an example of a platform jumper, then define what their games will look like.  Next, they use a structured process to plan the backgrounds, variables, sprites, and functions they will need to implement their game.  After writing the code for the game, students will reflect on how the game could be improved, and implement those changes.

            Plotting Shapes:
              name: Plotting Shapes
              description_student: Students explore the challenges of communicating how to draw with shapes and use a tool that introduces how this problem is approached in Game Lab. The warm up activity quickly demonstrates the challenges of communicating position without some shared reference point. In the main activity students explore a Game Lab tool that allows students to interactively place shapes on Game Lab's 400 by 400 grid. They then take turns instructing a partner how to draw a hidden image using this tool, accounting for many challenges students will encounter when programming in Game Lab. Students optionally create their own image to communicate before a debrief discussion.

            Shapes and Randomness:
              name: Shapes and Randomness
              description_student: This lesson extends the drawing skills to include width and height and introduces the concept of random number generation. The class learns to draw with versions of ellipse() and rect() that include width and height parameters and to use the background() block to fill the screen with color. At the end of the progression the class is introduced to the randomNumber() block and uses the new blocks to draw a randomized rainbow snake.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students continue to develop their drawing skills. At the beginning of the lesson a teacher-led discussion connects expanded block functionality (e.g. different sized shapes) with the need for more block inputs, or "parameters". Students learn to draw with versions of `ellipse()` and `rect()` that include width and height parameters. They also learn to use the `background()` block. At the end of the progression students are introduced to the `randomNumber()` block. Combining all of these skills students will draw a randomized rainbow snake at the end of the lesson.
            Variables:
              name: Variables
              description_student: This lesson introduces variables as a way to label a number in a program or save a randomly generated value. The class begins the lesson with a very basic description of the purpose of a variable and practices using the new blocks.  Afterwards, the class uses variables to save a random number, allowing the programs to use the same random number multiple times.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students learn how to use variables to label a number in their program or save a randomly generated value. Students begin the lesson with a very basic description of the purpose of a variable. Students then complete a level progression that reinforces the model of a variable as a way to label or name a number. Students use variables to save a random number to see that variables actually store or save their values, allowing them to use the same random number multiple times in their programs.
            Sprites:
              name: Sprites
              description_student: In order to create more interesting and detailed images, the class is introduced to the sprite object. Every sprite can be assigned an image to show, and sprites also keep track of multiple values about themselves, which will prove useful down the road when making animations.  At the end of the lesson, everyone creates a scene using sprites.

            The Draw Loop:
              name: The Draw Loop
              description_student: This lesson introduces the draw loop, one of the core programming paradigms in Game Lab.  The class combines the draw loop with random numbers to manipulate some simple animations with dots and then with sprites. Afterwards, everyone uses what they learned to update the sprite scene from the previous lesson.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students are introduced to the draw loop, one of the core programming paradigms in Game Lab. To begin the lesson students look at some physical flipbooks to see that having many frames with different images creates the impression of motion. Students then watch a video explaining how the draw loop in Game Lab helps to create this same impression in their programs. Students combine the draw loop with random numbers to manipulate some simple animations with dots and then with sprites. At the end of the lesson students use what they learned to update their sprite scene from the previous lesson.
            The Counter Pattern Unplugged:
              name: The Counter Pattern Unplugged
              description_student: This unplugged lesson explores the underlying behavior of variables. Using notecards and string to simulate variables within a program, the class implements a few short programs. Once comfortable with this syntax, the class uses the same process with sprite properties, tracking a sprite's progress across the screen.

            Conditionals:
              name: Conditionals
              description_student: The class starts by using booleans to compare the current value of a sprite property with a target value, using that comparison to determine when a sprite has reached a point on the screen, grown to a given size, or otherwise reached a value using the counter pattern. After using booleans directly to investigate the values or sprite properties, the class adds conditional if statements to write code that responds to those boolean comparisons.

After using booleans directly to investigate the values or sprite properties, students add conditional _if_ statements to write code that responds to those boolean comparisons.
            Keyboard Input:
              name: Keyboard Input
              description_student: Following the introduction to booleans and if statements in the previous lesson, students are introduced to a new block called keyDown() which returns a boolean and can be used in conditionals statements to move sprites around the screen. By the end of this lesson students will have written programs that take keyboard input from the user to control sprites on the screen.

            Other Forms of Input:
              name: Other Forms of Input
              description_student: The class continues to explore ways to use conditional statements to take user input. In addition to the simple keyDown() command learned yesterday, the class learns about several other keyboard input commands as well as ways to take mouse input.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students continue to explore ways to use conditional statements to take user input. In addition to the simple `keyDown()` command learned yesterday, students will learn about several other keyboard input commands as well as ways to take mouse input.
            Booleans Unplugged:
              name: Booleans Unplugged
              description_student: This lesson introduces boolean values and logic, as well as conditional statements. The class starts by playing a simple game of Stand Up, Sit Down in which the boolean (true/false) statements describe personal properties (hair or eye color, clothing type, age, etc). The class then groups objects based on increasingly complex boolean statements, then looks at how conditionals can impact the flow of a program.
              description_teacher: |-
                In this lesson, students are introduced to boolean values and logic, as well as conditional statements. The class starts by playing a simple game of Stand Up, Sit Down in which the boolean (true/false) statements describe personal properties (hair or eye color, clothing type, age, etc). This gets students thinking about how they can frame a property with multiple potential values (such as age) with a binary question.

                From there students are provided a group of objects with similar, yet varying, physical properties. With a partner they group those objects based on increasingly complex boolean statements, including compound booleans with AND and OR.

                Finally we reveal Conditionals as a tool to make decisions or impact the flow of a program using boolean statements as input.
            Project - Interactive Card:
              name: Project - Interactive Card
              description_student: In this cumulative project for Chapter 1, the class plans for and develops an interactive greeting card using all of the programming techniques they've learned to this point.

              description_student: The class plans and builds original games using the project guide from the previous two lessons. Working individually or in pairs, the class plans, develops, and gives feedback on the games.  After incorporating the peer feedback, the class shares out the completed games.
              description_teacher: Students will plan and build their own game using the project guide from the previous two lessons to guide their project. Working individually or in pairs, students will first decide on the type of game they'd like to build, taking as inspiration a set of sample games. They will then complete a blank project guide where they will describe the game's behavior and scope out the variables, sprites, and functions they'll need to build. In Code Studio, a series of levels prompts them on a general sequence they can use to implement this plan. Partway through the process, students will share their projects for peer review and will incorporate feedback as they finish their game. At the end of the lesson, students will share their completed games with their classmates. This project will span multiple classes and can easily take anywhere from 3-5 class periods.

              description_teacher: This lesson introduces the formal problem solving process that students will use over the course of the year, Define - Prepare - Try - Reflect. The lesson begins by asking students to brainstorm all the different types of problems that they encounter in everyday life. Students are then shown the four steps of the problem solving process and work together to relate these abstract steps to their actual experiences solving problems. First students relate these steps to the aluminum boats problem from the previous lesson, then a problem they are good at solving, then a problem they want to improve at solving.

                In this lesson students apply the problem solving process to three different problems in order to better understand the value of each step. They will solve a word search, arrange seating for a birthday party, and plan a trip. The problems grow increasingly complex and poorly defined to highlight how the problem solving process is particularly helpful when tackling these types of problems. The lesson concludes with students reflecting on their experience with the problem solving process. They will justify the inclusion of each step and will brainstorm questions or strategies that can help them better define open-ended problems, as this is often the most critical step.

                This lesson will likely take two class periods or more to complete. The first two problems may fit into a single class period but the third will need to be moved to a second day.

Groups are assigned to a computing device and based on a teacher-provided definition of input and output, list the inputs and outputs of their device. Earlier in the activity students are prompted to focus on more obvious physical inputs and outputs (e.g. a keyboard as an input or a screen as an output) but later discussions lead students to consider less obvious examples (e.g. that a touch screen is both an input and output, or the fact that the Internet can serve as both input and output). Throughout the lesson the teacher records inputs and outputs that are identified on a T-Chart at the front of the room. To conclude the lesson students examine common activities they do on a computing device and select the inputs and outputs used for that activity from the chart.
            Processing:
              name: Processing
              description_student: This lesson dives deeper into the concept of processing that was introduced as part of the definition of a computer.  Pairs work together to puta deck of cards in order, a form of processing information.  In the end, the class discusses what processing means within the context of solving information problems.
              description_teacher: Students complete two unplugged card sorting activities to explore the meaning of processing and its relationship to problem-solving. The first has few constraints and is used to introduce a high-level definition of processing. The next introduces more constraints that forces students to develop an algorithm that will always successfully process the cards. Students iteratively develop, test, and share their algorithms with classmates. A wrap-up discussion has students reflect on the different types of problem-solving they used in these activities and the value of producing an algorithm to solve a problem.
            Storage:
              name: Storage
              description_student: This lesson focuses on the storage component of the definition of a computer, within the content of processing information. The class spends the majority of the lesson developing and sharing algorithms to process information, with an emphasis on how much storage is needed for any particular algorithm. The lesson concludes with a discussion of the importance of storage while processing information.
              description_teacher: Students explore the importance of storage within the Input-Storage-Processing-Output model of a computer. The warm-up activity asks students to reflect on the types of information they have seen computers store in the past, like documents, photographs, or videos. The unplugged main activity has students develop an algorithm to process a small pile of cards in search of specific cards within the deck. Constraints on how students can move the cards force them to consider the importance of storage even while they are processing the deck. The lesson concludes with a discussion of the two types of storage students saw in this lesson and the importance of storage while processing information.

The class begins by discussing what types of information are good to share with other people, then looks at several sample social media pages to see what types of personal information could be shared intentionally or unintentionally.  Finally, the class comes up with a set of guidelines to follow when putting information online.
              description_teacher: "As students have recently spent some time thinking about the actual content that will go into their personal website, this lesson takes a step back from the unit-long project (publication of a personal website) to help students articulate what personal information they choose to share digitally and with whom.  It also reinforces the notion that much of the information that they choose to share digitally falls largely out of their control the moment it is released.  \r\n\r\nStudents begin by individually identifying appropriate audiences with whom they would be comfortable sharing given pieces of personal information.  They then look at several social media pages to determine what sorts of information people are sharing about themselves or one another.  Last, students reflect on what guidelines they think are appropriate for posting information online.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate point of this lesson is not to scare students, but rather to experientially bring students to realizing precisely what level of control they don’t have in releasing information into the web."

              description_teacher: To kick off a unit devoted to group problem solving and developing products for other users, students begin by investigating the design of various teapots. Students analyze each teapot, attempting to identify how specific user needs might have informed its design. By considering these design choices, and attempting to match each teapot with a potential user, students can begin to see how taking a user-centered approach to designing products (both physical and digital) can make those products more useful and usable. To conclude the activity, students are asked to propose some changes to one of the teapots that would make it more useful or usable.

              description_teacher: This lesson guides students through an abbreviated version of the design process they will be seeing throughout this unit. Students first brainstorm a list of potential users of smart clothing. As a class, they then group these ideas into broad categories and each group will choose one category of user. Groups repeat this process to brainstorm needs or concerns of their user, eventually categorizing these needs and choosing one to focus on. Finally, students design a piece of smart clothing, using the specific needs and concerns they brainstormed to guide their decision making. At the end of the class students quickly share their decision-making process and get feedback on how well their product addresses the user need they selected.

            Designing Apps for Good:
              name: Designing Apps for Good
              description_student: To kick off the app design project, the class organizes into teams and starts exploring app topics. Several example socially impactful apps serve as inspiration for the project.
              description_teacher: To kick off the app design project that lasts through the end of the unit, students first explore a number of apps designed for social impact that have been created by other students. The class then reviews the Define, Prepare, Try, and Reflect steps of the Problem Solving process as they develop an idea for an app of their own with social impact. Finally, students will form project teams and lay out a contract for how the team will function throughout the development of their app.
            Market Research:
              name: Market Research
              description_student: Dive into app development by exploring existing apps that may serve similar users. Each group identifies a handful of apps that address the same topic they are working on, using those apps to help refine the app idea they will pursue.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students research apps similar to the one they intend on creating to better understand the needs of their users. Students work within their teams to search the Internet for other apps, then evaluate the ones they find interesting. By the end of the lesson, each team will have a clearer idea about the type of app they want to create and further refine who their target users are. Each team will maintain a list of citations for all the apps they examined for use in their final presentation.
            Paper Prototypes:
              name: Paper Prototypes
              description_student: Paper prototypes allow developers to quickly test ideas before investing a lot of time writing code. In this lesson teams explore some example apps created in App Lab, using those apps to help inform the first paper prototypes of their apps.
              description_teacher: "Before starting to design apps, we need to help students to better scope their expectations. Because students will eventually be prototyping these apps in App Lab, they will be in better shape if their ideas align with the kinds of apps that are easily prototyped in App Lab. Teams start this scoping by looking through several example apps designed to demonstrate apps that can be created with App Lab. Teams then can chose one (or more) of the apps as a basis for their own. From there, teams have some time to discuss the basic functionality of their app before using 3x5 index cards to develop paper prototypes.\r\n"
            Prototype Testing:
              name: Prototype Testing
              description_student: In this lesson teams test out their paper prototypes with other members of the class. With one student role playing the computer, one narrating, and the rest observing, teams will get immediate feedback on their app designs which will inform the next version of their app prototypes.
              description_teacher: The primary purpose of developing paper prototypes is that they allow for quick testing and iteration before any code is written. This lesson is focused on giving teams a chance to test their prototypes before moving to App Lab. Teams develop a plan to test with users before running prototype tests with multiple other students in the class (and potentially outside the class). In order to test the prototype with the users, the students will have to assign roles in the testing (the “narrator”, the “computer” and the “observers”) as well as have some questions prepared for the user to answer after the test is complete.
            Digital Design:
              name: Digital Design
              description_student: Having developed, tested, and gathered feedback on a paper prototype, teams now move to App Lab to build the next iteration of their apps. Using the drag-and-drop Design Mode, each team member builds out at least one page of their team's app, responding to feedback that was received in the previous round of testing.
              description_teacher: Having collaboratively developed a paper prototype for their apps, groups now divide and conquer to begin work on an interactive digital version based on the paper prototype. Using the drag-and-drop design mode of App Lab, students individually work through a progression of skill-building levels to learn how to build digital versions of a paper prototype. From there, each group member builds out at least one page of their app in App Lab, to be later combined into a single app.
            Event Driven Programming:
              name: Event Driven Programming
              description_student: Building on the screens that the class designed in the previous lesson, teams combine screens into a single app. Simple code can then be added to make button clicks change to the appropriate screen.
              description_teacher: In this lesson teams combine the screens that they designed in the previous lesson into a single app, which they then begin to program using simple events. Students learn basic event driven programming by making several small apps that respond to users clicking buttons. Following that, group members share the screens they've developed and each group member imports all of the screens into their own copy of the app, which they will make interactive by connecting buttons to events.
            Basic App Functionality:
              name: Basic App Functionality
              description_student: Teams add a bit more polish and functionality to their apps before testing. Several examples are provided to demonstrate simple code that adds cool features.
              description_teacher: At this point in the development process, each student should have what is essentially a digital version of the paper prototype - static screens that are linked together with buttons. For many apps this is all you really need to start testing with users, but this lesson will give students a chance to explore simple ways to add a bit more functionality to their apps before moving into the testing phase. The programming concepts introduced in this lesson are **not necessary** to successfully complete the project, and can be omitted at your discretion.
            Testing the App:
              name: Testing the App
              description_student: Teams run another round of user testing, this time with their interactive prototype. Feedback gathered from this round of testing will inform the final iteration of the app prototypes.
              description_teacher: 'By the end of the previous lesson each team should have a minimum viable prototype of their app. The primary purpose of this lesson is to have the team actually test the app with other people, preferably from the target audience the app is intended for, or from different teams in the class while observers from the team will record the results on the worksheets they used in the planning phase. As with testing the paper prototypes, teams will start by planning for the specific scenarios before running and observing tests. '
            Improving and Iterating:
              name: Improving and Iterating
              description_student: Using the feedback from the last round of testing, teams implement changes that address the needs of their users. Each team tracks and prioritizes the features they want to add and the bugs they need to fix.
              description_teacher: Teams have at this point developed an app prototype that has gone through multiple iterations and rounds of user testing. With the information and guidance gained from the last round of user testing, each student has the opportunity to plan for and implement improvements to the team app. Depending on the time you have available, and student interest, you can run the cycle of testing and iteration as many times as you see fit.
            App Presentation:
              name: App Presentation
              description_student: Each team prepares a presentation to "pitch" the app they've developed. This is the time to share struggles, triumphs, and plans for the future.
              description_teacher: At this point teams have researched a topic of personal and social importance, developed and tested both a paper prototype and a digital prototype, and iterated on the initial app to incorporate new features and bug fixes. Now is the time for them to review what they have done and pull together a coherent presentation to demonstrate their process of creation. Using the provided presentation template, teams prepare to present about their process of app development, including the problem they set out to solve, the ways in which they've incorporated feedback from testing, and their plans for the future.
            User Interface and Prototype Testing:
              name: User Interface and Prototype Testing
              description_student: See how a paper prototype can be used to test and get feedback on software before writing any code. To help out a developer with their idea, the class tests and provides an app prototype made of paper.
              description_teacher: Following the mini design project, students look towards the next phase of design - prototyping a product that attempts to address user needs. In teams, students examine a paper prototype for a chat app called "Txt Ur Grndkdz". Through using this paper prototype, students get a chance to see how a simple paper prototype can be used to quickly test ideas and assumptions before we ever get to the computer. After "using" the provided prototype students begin to identify ways to improve the next iteration.
            Feedback and Prototypes:
              name: Feedback and Prototypes
              description_student: Users have been testing an app, and they have lots of feedback for the developer. The class needs to sort through all of this feedback, identify the common themes and needs, and start revising the prototype to make it better meet the users' needs.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students use feedback from "users" of the paper-prototyped app from the previous lesson in order to develop improvements to the user interface of that paper prototype. The lesson begins with a reflection on the fact that designers need to translate human needs with technology into changes to the user interface or experience. Students are then given a collection of feedback and requests from users of the app from the previous lesson. In groups students categorize the feedback and identify ways the needs expressed in the feedback could be met by changes to the interface of the app. Then in groups students will implement some of these changes to meet one of the needs they identified.
            Identifying User Needs:
              name: Identifying User Needs
              description_student: Up to this point the users that the class has considered have all been remote, and the only information from users has come through text or role playing. Now the class will rely on each other as potential users, and pairs will get to interview each other to identify needs that could be addressed by developing an app.
              description_teacher: 'Up to this point students have focused on designing for users who are, to some degree, distanced from them. Whether through brainstorming, profiles, or text feedback, the connection to an end user has never been direct. This is distance is designed to help students get outside their own head when thinking about users, but in order to get information more directly from an actual user, students need to rely on their classmates. In this lesson students pair up to become users (and designers) for each other, allowing everyone to directly interview their end user and ask questions to better inform their design. Each student pair interviews each other, attempting to identify a specific need that could be addressed by an app. '
            Project - Paper Prototype:
              name: Project - Paper Prototype
              description_student: Using the interview information from the previous lesson, the class comes up with app ideas to address the needs of their users. To express those ideas, and test out their effectiveness, each student creates and tests paper prototypes of their own.
              description_teacher: Based on the peer interview from the previous lesson, each student comes up with an idea for an app that will address their user's problem. Students then get to create their own paper prototype of their app ideas by drawing "screens" on individual notecards. A project guide directs students through the process including building the app and testing it with their user to see if their assumptions about the user interfaces they created are accurate.
            Linking Screens:
              name: Linking Screens
              description_student: Building on the screens that the class designed in the previous lesson, teams combine screens into a single app. Simple code can then be added to make button clicks change to the appropriate screen.
              description_teacher: In this lesson teams combine the screens that they designed in the previous lesson into a single app, which they can then link together using code. Students learn basic event driven programming by building up the model app that they started in the previous lesson. In addition to the screen that students designed yesterday, they'll learn how to create additional screens and even import screens made by others.
            User Interfaces:
              name: User Interfaces
              description_student: See how a paper prototype can be used to test and get feedback on software before writing any code. To help out a developer with their idea, the class tests and provides an app prototype made of paper.

          description_short: Learn to program with physical devices.
          description: Unit 6 explores the role of hardware platforms in computing and how different sensors can provide more effective input and output than the traditional keyboard, mouse, and monitor. Using App Lab and Adafruit’s Circuit Playground, you’ll develop programs that utilize the same hardware inputs and outputs that you see in the smart devices, looking at how a simple rough prototype can lead to a finished product. The unit concludes with a design challenge to use the Circuit Playground as the basis for an innovation of your own design.

              description_teacher: To kick off the final unit of this course, students will do some research into interesting innovations in computing. This lesson will expose students to wider variety of computing form factors (what a computer looks like) and fields that are impacted by computing. Later in this unit students will look back on the devices they encountered in this lesson as they develop their own physical computing devices.
            Input Unplugged:
              name: Input Unplugged
              description_student: Experience two different ways that an app can take input from a user, while learning more about the event-driven programming model used in App Lab.
              description_teacher: In preparation for delving deeper into programming with App Lab, students will explore how a handful of different programs written in both Game Lab and App Lab handle taking input from the user. After comparing and contrasting the approaches they saw in the example apps, students group up to act out the two different models for input (conditionals in an infinite loop and asynchronous events) to gain a better understanding of how they work.
            Event Types:
              name: Event Types
              description_student: Review the basics of programming in App Lab and explore some new event types that can be used in your programs.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students review the material they learned about creating apps in App Lab from Unit 4 in order to prepare for a return to App Lab in this unit. This review should be modified to best meet the needs of your students and their experience and familiarity with programming in App Lab. In addition to the review the students will also experiment with a variety of new event types that they likely have not seen before.
            Getters and Setters:
              name: Getters and Setters
              description_student: By reading and changing the content on the screen of an app, the class starts to build apps that only need a single screen. Even with just one screen, these techniques allow for lots of user interaction and functionality.
              description_teacher: In Unit 4 students learned a very simple approach to app development in App Lab that required a separate screen for most interactions. To expand the kinds of apps that students can make, and to encourage them to think in new ways about how users interact with apps, we introduce the concept of "getters" and "setters". These are commands which can get and set (or change) the content and properties of various design elements. In this lesson students build up simple apps that only require a single screen, the content of which is changed using getters and setters.
            The Circuit Playground:
              name: The Circuit Playground
              description_student: Get to know the Circuit Playground, the circuit board that will be used throughout the rest of this unit. Using App Lab, develop programs that use the Circuit Playground for output.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students get their first opportunity to write programs that use the Circuit Playground. After first inspecting the board visually and hypothesizing possibly functionalities, students move online where they will learn to write applications that control an LED. By combining App Lab screens with the Circuit Playgrounds, students can gradually start to integrate elements of the board as an ouput device while relying on App Lab for user input.
            Lists:
              name: Lists
              description_student: Learn how lists can be used to store multiple values in a single variable name.
              description_teacher: A list, also commonly known as an array, is a type of variable that can store many values at once. In this lesson, students learn to create lists which store a series of related values in a single variable. After creating lists of their own, students will learn about ways to extract either a specific or random value from a list using its index.
            Lights:
              name: Lights
              description_student: Using the concept of lists from the previous lesson, the class writes programs that control the ten color LEDs on the Circuit Playground.
              description_teacher: The Circuit Playground includes 10 color LEDs in a ring around the outside edge. These LEDs are accessible in code as a list called `colorLeds`. Building on the understanding of lists from the previous lesson, students write programs that control the color LEDs by accessing them from a list.
            For Loops:
              name: For Loops
              description_student: The class learns about repeating instructions using a _for loop_, first by controlling a "robot" through a grid, and then in App Lab.
              description_teacher: Students are introduced to the _for loop_ in this lesson as a way to repeat some code a certain numbers of times. Students start with an unplugged activity where they use for loops to navigate a robot across a grid. Once complete, students then take their knowledge into App Lab where they write programs that rely on iteration using a _for loop_.
            Lists and For Loops:
              name: Lists and For Loops
              description_student: Combining _lists_ and _for loops_ allows you to write code that impacts every element of a list, regardless of how long it is. The class uses this structure to write programs that process all of the elements in lists, include the list of color LEDs.
              description_teacher: 'Using a _for loop_ to iterate over all of the elements in an array is a really useful construct in most programming languages. In this lesson, students combine what they have learned about lists and for loops in order to start learning this pattern. Students use for loops to go through each element in a list one at a time without having to write code for each element. Towards the end of the lesson students will apply this with the `colorLed` list on the board. '
            Timed Loops:
              name: Timed Loops
              description_student: In this lesson we build on students understanding of for loops to learn about a more sophisticated structure called a timed loop. Unlike for loops, you can control how quickly a timed loop repeats, and other code (such as event handlers) can be run between iterations of the loop. This allows us to create interesting animations that repeat infinitely, while still allowing other code to run alongside it.

              description_teacher: This lesson transitions students from consider the Circuit Playground as strictly an output device towards using it as a tool for both input and output. Starting with the hardware buttons and switch,sing the hardware buttons and switch, students learn to use `onBoardEvent()`, analogously to `onEvent()`, in order to take input from their Circuit Playgrounds.
            Analog Input:
              name: Analog Input
              description_student: Explore the analog inputs on the Circuit Playground, writing programs that respond to the environment through sensors.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students explore how the three analog sensors (sound, light, and temperature) can be used to write programs that respond to changes in the environment. The use of these sensors marks a transition in terms of how users interact with a program. By using sensors as an input, the user of an app doesn't have to directly interact with it at all, or may interact without actually realizing they are doing so.
            Sensor Applications:
              name: Sensor Applications
              description_student: Work through three small apps to better understand the uses of the sensors from the previous lesson.

              name: Designing Screens with Code
              description_student: By reading and changing the content on the screen of an app, the class starts to build apps that only need a single screen. Even with just one screen, these techniques allow for lots of user interaction and functionality.
              description_teacher: In Unit 4 students learned a very simple approach to app development in App Lab that required a separate screen for most interactions. To expand the kinds of apps that students can make, and to encourage them to think in new ways about how users interact with apps, we introduce the `setProperty()` block. This command can be used to set the content and properties of various UI elements, allowing students to write programs that update information on a single screen, instead of manually creating duplicate screens. In this lesson students build up simple apps that only require a single screen, the content of which is changed using `setProperty()`.
            Board Events:

              name: The Program Design Process
              description_student: This lesson introduces students to the process they will use to design programs of their own throughout this unit. This process is centered around a project guide which asks students to sketch out their screens, identify elements of the Circuit Playground to be used, define variables, and describe events before they begin programming. This process is similar to the Game Design Process that we used in Unit 3. In this lesson students begin by playing a tug o' war style game where the code is hidden. They discuss what they think the board components, events, and variables would need to be to make the program. They are then given a completed project guide which shows one way to implement the project. Students are then walked through this process through a series of levels. At the end of the lesson students have an opportunity to make improvements to the program to make it their own.

            Representation Matters:
              name: Representation Matters
              description_student: This first lesson provides an overview of what data is and how it is used to solve problems.  Groups use a data set to make a series of meal recommendations for people with various criteria.   Afterwards, groups compare their responses and discuss how the different representations of the meal data affected how the students were able to solve the different problems.
              description_teacher: In the first lesson of the data unit, students get an overview of what data is and how it is used to solve problems.  Students start off with a brief discussion to come to a common understanding of data.  They then split into groups and use a data set to make a series of meal recommendations for people with various criteria.  Each group has the choices of meal represented in a different way (pictures, recipes, menu, nutrition) that gives an advantage for one of the recommendations.  Afterwards, groups compare their responses and discuss how the different representations of the meal data affected how the students were able to solve the different problems.
            Patterns and Representation:
              name: Patterns and Representation
              description_student: This lesson looks closer at what is needed to create a system of representation.  Groups create systems that can represent any letter in the alphabet using only a single stack of cards, then create messages with their systems and exchange with other groups to ensure the system worked as intended.   The class discusses commonalities between working systems while recognizing that there are many possible working solutions.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students create their own system for representing information. They begin by brainstorming all the different systems they already use to represent yes-no responses. They then work in small groups to create a system that can represent any letter in the alphabet using only a single stack of cards. The cards used have one of 6 different possible drawings (6 animals, 6 colors, etc.) and so to represent the entire alphabet students will need to use patterns of multiple cards to represent each letter. Students create messages with their systems and exchange with other groups to ensure the system worked as intended. In the wrap-up discussion the class  reviews any pros and cons of the different systems. They discuss commonalities between working systems and recognize that there are many possible solutions to this problem and what's important is that everyone use the same arbitrary system to communicate.
            ASCII and Binary Representation:
              name: ASCII and Binary Representation
              description_student: This lesson introduces a formal binary system for encoding information, the ASCII system for representing letters and other characters. At the beginning of the lesson the teacher introduces the fact that computers must represent information using either "on" or "off". The class is then introduced to the ASCII system for representing text using binary symbols and practices using this system before encoding their own messages using ASCII.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students learn to use their first binary system for encoding information, the ASCII system for representing letters and other characters. At the beginning of the lesson the teacher introduces the fact that computers must represent information using either "on" or "off". Then students are introduced to the ASCII system for representing text using binary symbols. Students practice using this system before encoding their own message using ASCII. At the end of the lesson a debrief conversation helps synthesize the key learning objectives of the activity.
            Representing Images:
              name: Representing Images
              description_student: This lesson continues the study of binary representation systems, this time with images. The class is introduced to the concept of splitting images into squares or "pixels" which can then be turned on or off individually to make the entire image. After doing a short set of challenges using the Pixelation Widget, the class makes connections between the system for representing images and the system for representing text they learned in the previous lesson.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students learn how computers represent images. To begin the lesson they consider the challenge of turning all the complexity of vision into a binary pattern. Through a series of images showing how this transformation is made students are introduced to the concept of splitting images into squares or "pixels" which can then be turned on or off individually to make the entire image. Students then do a short set of challenges using the Pixelation Widget in order to draw black and white images. Puzzles are designed to call out some of the challenges of representing images in this way. In the wrap up students make connections between the system for representing images and the system for representing text they learned in the previous lesson.

            Combining Representations:
              name: Combining Representations
              description_student: This lesson combines all three types of binary representation systems (ASCII characters, binary number, and images) to allow for the encode of more complex types information in a record.  After seeing a series of bits and being asked to decode them, the class is introduced to the idea that  understanding binary information requires understanding both the system that is being used and the meaning of the information encoded.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students use all three types of binary representation systems (ASCII characters, binary number, and images) to decode information in a record.  After seeing a series of bits and being asked to decode them, students are introduced to the idea that in order to understand binary information, they must understand both the system that is being used and the meaning of the information encoded.  They then decode a record representing a pet based on a given structure.
            Project - Create a Representation:
              name: Project - Create a Representation
              description_student: The class designs structure to represent their perfect day using the binary representation systems they've learned in this chapter. After deciding which pieces of information the record should capture, the class will decide how a punch card of bytes of information will be interpreted to represent those pieces of information. Afterwards, everyone will use the ASCII, binary number, and image formats they have learned to represent their perfect days try to decipher what a partner's perfect day is like.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students design a structure to represent their perfect day using the binary representation systems they've learned in this chapter. Students will first write a short description of their perfect day and then review with a partner to identify the key pieces of information they think a computer could capture. As a class students will decide how a punch card of bytes of information will be interpreted to represent those pieces of information. Students will then use the ASCII, binary number, and image formats they have learned to represent their perfect days. Students then trade punch cards and try to decipher what the other student's perfect day is like. The lesson ends with a reflection.
            Problem Solving and Data:
              name: Problem Solving and Data
              description_student: This lesson covers how the problem solving process can be tailored to deal with data problems, in particular.  The class is tasked with deciding what a city most needs to spend resources on.  They must find and use data from the Internet to support their decision.
              description_teacher: 'In this lesson, students use the problem solving process from earlier in the course to solve a data problem.  After reviewing the process, the class is presented with a decision: whether a city should build a library, pet shelter, or fire department.  Students work in teams to collect information on the Internet to help them decide what should be built, then use this information build an argument that will convince the city council of their choice.  They then map what they have done to the problem solving process that they have been using throughout the course, comparing the general problem solving process to its specific application to data problems.'
            Making Decisions with Data:
              name: Making Decisions with Data
              description_student: This lesson gives the class a chance to practice the data problem solving process introduced in the last lesson.  Not all questions have right answers and in some cases the class can and should decide that they should collect more data. The lesson concludes with a discussion of how different people could draw different conclusions from the same data, or how collecting different data might have affected the decisions they made.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students get practice making decisions with data based on some problems designed to be familiar to middle school students. Students work in groups discussing how they would use the data presented to make a decision before the class discusses their final choices. Not all questions have right answers and in some cases students can and should decide that they should collect more data. The lesson concludes with a discussion of how different people could draw different conclusions from the same data, or how collecting different data might have affected the decisions they made.
            Interpreting Data:
              name: Interpreting Data
              description_student: Students begin the lesson by looking at a cake preference survey that allows respondents to specify both a cake and an icing flavor.  They discuss how knowing the relationship between cake and icing preference helps them better decide which combination to recommend.  They are then introduced to cross tabulation, which allows them to graph relationships to different preferences.  They use this technique to find relationships in a preference survey, then brainstorm the different types of problems that this process could help solve.

            Automating Data Decisions:
              name: Automating Data Decisions
              description_student: In this lesson students look at a simple example of how a computer could be used to complete the decision making step of the data problem solving process. Students are given the task of creating an algorithm that could suggest a vacation spot.  Students then create rules, or an algorithm, that a computer could use to make this decision automatically. Students share their rules and what choices their rules would make with the class data. They then use their rules on data from their classmates to test whether their rules would make the same decision that  a person would. The lesson concludes with a discussion about the benefits and drawbacks of using computers to automate the data problem solving process.

            Problem Solving with Big Data:
              name: Problem Solving with Big Data
              description_student: This lesson covers how data is collected and used by a organizations to solve problems in the real world. The class looks at three scenarios that could be solved using data and brainstorms the types of data they would want to solve them and how they could collect the data.  Each scenario also includes a video about a real-world service that has solved a similar problem with data.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students look at how data is collected and used by organizations to solve problems in the real world. The lesson begins with a quick review of the data problem solving process they  explored in the last lesson. Then students are presented three scenarios that could be solved using data and brainstorm the types of data they would want to solve them and how they could collect the data. Each problem is designed to reflect a real-world service that exists. After brainstorming, students watch a video about a real-world service and record notes about what data is collected by the real-world service and how it is used. At the end of the lesson, students record whether data was provided actively by a user, was recorded passively, or is collected by sensors.
            Project - Solve a Data Problem:
              name: Project - Solve a Data Problem
              description_student: To conclude this unit the class designs ways to use data to make a recommendations or predictions to help solve a problem.  In the first several steps the class brainstorms problems, performs simple research, and defines a problem of their choosing. They then decide what kind of data they want to collect, how it could be collected, and how it could be used, before exchanging feedback and giving a final presentation.
              description_teacher: To conclude this unit, students design a recommendation engine based on data that they collect and analyze from their classmates. After looking at an example of a recommendation app, students follow a project guide to complete this multi-day activity. In the first several steps, students choose what choice they want to help the user to make, what data they need to give the recommendation, create a survey, and collect information about their classmates' choices. They then interpret the data and use what they have learned to create the recommendation algorithm.  Last, they use their algorithms to make recommendations to a few classmates. Students perform a peer review and make any necessary updates to their projects before preparing a presentation to the class.
            Representing Numbers:
              name: Representing Numbers
              description_student: This lesson introduces the binary number system.  With a set of cards that represent the place values in a binary (base-2) number system, the class turns bits "on" or "off" by turning cards face up and face down, then observes the numbers that result from these different patterns.  Eventually, the pattern is extended to a generic 4-bit system.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students learn about the binary number system.  With a set of cards that represent the place values in a binary (base-2) number system by a collection of dots, students turn bits "on" or "off" by turning cards face up and face down, then observe the numbers that result from these different patterns.  Eventually, students extend the pattern to a generic 4-bit system.
            8-bit Numbers:
              name: 8-bit Numbers
              description_student: Students review the concept of binary numbers, and discuss that they need to know the bit-length of each number in order to decode a series of bits.  They then made a flippy-do, a paper manipulative that will help them to encode and decode 8-bit numbers (0-255).  After practicing with the flippy-do, students discuss how they could extend that standardization to the other types of data.

            Encryption:
              name: Encryption
              description_student: Students have a discussion on the different levels of security they would like for personal data.  Once the class has developed an understanding of the importance of privacy, they learn about the process of encrypting information by enciphering a note for a partner and deciphering the partner's note.  The class concludes with a discussion about the importance of both physical and digital security.

            Structuring Data:
              name: Structuring Data
              description_student: This lesson goes further into the interpretation of data, including cleaning and visualizing raw data sets.  The class first looks at the how presenting data in different ways can help people to understand it better.  After seeing how cleaning and visualization can help people make better decisions, the class looks at what parts of this process can be automated, and what need a human.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students go further into the collection and interpretation of data, including cleaning and visualizing data.  Students first look at the how presenting data in different ways can help people to understand it better, and they then create visualizations of their own data. Using a the results of a preferred pizza topping survey, students must decide what to do with data that does not easily fit into the visualization scheme that they have chosen.  Finally, students look at which parts of this process can be automated by a computer and which need a human to make decisions.
            Keeping Data Secret:

            Introduction:
              name: Introduction to Online Puzzles
              description_student: This lesson will give you practice in the skills you will need for this course.
              description_teacher: 'In this set of puzzles, students will begin with an introduction (or review depending on the experience of your class) of Code.org''s online workspace. There will be videos pointing out the basic functionality of the workspace including the `Run`, `Reset`, and `Step` buttons. Also discussed in these videos: dragging Blockly blocks, deleting Blockly blocks, and connecting Blockly blocks. Next, students will practice their _sequencing_ and _debugging_ skills in maze. From there, students will see new types of puzzles like Collector, Artist, and Harvester when they learn the very basics of _loops_.'
            'Algorithms: Graph Paper Programming':
              name: 'Programming: Graph Paper Programming'
              description_student: In this lesson, you will program your friend to draw pictures!
              description_teacher: By "programming" one another to draw pictures, students will begin to understand what coding is really about. The class will begin by having students instruct each other to color squares on graph paper in an effort to reproduce an existing picture. If there’s time, the lesson can conclude with images that the students create themselves.
            Events in Bounce:
              name: Events in Bounce
              description_student: Ever wish you could play video games in school? In this lesson, you will get to make your own!
              description_teacher: In this online activity, students will learn what events are, and how computers use them in programs like video games. Students will work through puzzles making the program react to events (like arrow buttons being pressed.) At the end of the puzzle, students will have the opportunity to customize their game with different speeds and sounds.
            Nested Loops:
              name: Nested Loops
              description_student: Loops inside loops inside loops. What does this mean? This lesson will teach you what happens when you place a loop inside another loop.
              description_teacher: In this online activity, students will have the opportunity to push their understanding of loops to a whole new level. Playing with the Bee and Plants vs Zombies, students will learn how to program a loop to be inside of another loop. They will also be encouraged to figure out how little changes in either loop will affect their program when they click `Run`.
            Nested Loops in Artist:
              name: Nested Loops in Artist
              description_student: Here you will be using nested loops to make cool drawings to show to your family and friends.
              description_teacher: Now that students know how to layer their loops, they can create so many beautiful things.  This lesson will take students through a series of exercises to help them create their own portfolio-ready images.
            'Algorithms: Relay Programming':
              name: 'Debugging: Relay Programming'
              description_student: Remember at the beginning of the course when you made drawings with code? In this lesson, you will be working with a team to do something very similar!
              description_teacher: This activity will begin with a short review of "Graph Paper Programming," then will quickly move to a race against the clock, as students break into teams and work together to write a program one instruction at a time.
            Debugging in Bee:
              name: Debugging in Bee
            While Loops in Farmer:
              name: While Loops in Farmer
              description_student: 'Loops are so useful in coding. This lesson will teach you about a new kind of loop: while loops!'
              description_teacher: "By the time students reach this lesson, they should already have plenty of practice using `repeat` loops, so now it's time to mix things up. \n\n_While loops_ are loops that continue to repeat commands while a condition is met. While loops are used when the programmer doesn't know the exact number of times commands need to be repeated, but does know what condition needs to be true in order for the loop to continue repeating. For example, students will be working to fill holes and dig dirt in Farmer. They will not know the size of the holes or the height of the mountains of dirt, but the students will know they need to keep filling the holes and digging the dirt as long as the ground is not flat."
            Conditionals with Cards:
              name: 'If/Else: Conditionals with Cards'
              description_student: It's time to play a game where you earn points only under certain conditions!
              description_teacher: "This lesson demonstrates how conditionals can be used to tailor a program to specific information. We don’t always have all of the information we need when writing a program. Sometimes you will want to do something different in one situation than in another, even if you don't know what situation will be true when your code runs. That is where conditionals come in. Conditionals allow a computer to make a decision, based on the information that is true any time your code is run.\n\n"
            Conditionals in Bee:
              name: Conditionals in Bee
              description_student: 'Now that you understand conditionals, it''s time to program Bee to use them when collecting honey and nectar. '
              description_teacher: Up until this point students have been writing code that executes exactly the same way each time it is run - reliable, but not very flexible. In this lesson, your class will begin to code with conditionals, allowing them to write code that functions differently depending on the specific conditions the program encounters.
            Conditionals & Loops in Maze:
              name: Conditionals & Loops in Maze
              description_student: You can do some amazing things when you use conditionals and loops together!
              description_teacher: 'In this lesson, students will be pairing together two key concepts: loops and conditionals. This set of puzzles bridges the gaps in understanding that occur when working on puzzles that use multiple kinds of blocks. By bringing two ideas together, students will create more complex code that shows both impressive creativity and critical thinking!'
            Conditionals & Loops in Farmer:
              name: Conditionals & Loops in Harvester
              description_student: It's not always clear when to use each conditional.  This lesson will help you get practice deciding what to do.
              description_teacher: Students will practice `while` loops, `until` loops, and `if / else` statements. All of these blocks use conditionals. By practicing all three, students will learn to write complex and flexible code.
            Digital Citizenship:
              name: 'Digital Citizenship: Practicing Digital Citizenship'
              description_student: Some information is not safe to share online. This lesson will help you learn the difference between safe and private information.
              description_teacher: |-
                In collaboration with Common Sense Education, this lesson helps students learn to think critically about the user information that some websites request or require. Students learn the difference between private information and personal information, distinguishing what is safe and unsafe to share online.

                Students will also explore what it means to be responsible and respectful to their offline and online communities as a step toward learning how to be good digital citizens.
            Build a Play Lab Game:
              name: Build a Play Lab Game
              description_student: This lesson will guide you through making your very own video game.
              description_teacher: In this online activity, students will have the opportunity to learn how to use events in Play Lab and to apply all of the coding skills they've learned to create an animated game. It's time to get creative and make a game in Play Lab!
            'Unplugged: Binary':
              name: 'Beyond Programming: Binary Images'
              description_student: 'Learn how computers store pictures using simple ideas like on and off. '
              description_teacher: Though many people think of binary as strictly zeros and ones, students will be introduced to the idea that information can be represented in a variety of binary options. This lesson takes that concept one step further as it illustrates how a computer can store even more complex information (such as images and colors) in binary, as well.
            Artist Binary:
              name: Binary in Artist
              description_student: Direct your own artist to create a binary image using only commands to turn pixels on and off.
              description_teacher: Binary is extremely important in the world of computers. The majority of computers today store all sorts of information in binary form. This lesson helps demonstrate how it is possible to take something from real life and translate it into a series of ons and offs. Students will build binary images in Artist by translating 0s and 1s to offs and ons (or blacks and whites).
            Nested Loops Project in Artist:
              name: Nested Loops in Frozen
              description_student: More nested loops! This time, you get to make some AMAZING drawing with nested loops.
              description_teacher: Students will create intricate designs using Artist in today's set of puzzles. By continuing to practice nested loops with new goals, students will see more uses of loops in general. This set of puzzles also offers a lot more potential for creativity with an opportunity for students to create their own design at the end of the stage.
            Debugging in Collector:
              name: Debugging in Collector
              description_student: Have you ever run into problems while coding? In this lesson, you will learn about the secrets of debugging. Debugging is the process of finding and fixing problems in your code.
              description_teacher: In this online activity, students will practice debugging in the "collector" environment. Students will get to practice reading and editing code to fix puzzles with simple algorithms, loops and nested loops.

              description_teacher: "The next four lessons provide an opportunity for students to put their coding skills to use in a capstone project. This project will help individuals gain experience with coding and produce an exemplar to share with peers and loved ones. Intended to be a multi-lesson or multi-week experience, students will spend time exploring brainstorming, learning about the design process, building, and presenting their final work. \n\nIn the explore stage, students will be able to view pre-built examples of projects in both Artist and Play Lab for inspiration. Next, students will learn about the design process and how to implement it in their own projects. They will then be given the space to create their own project in either Artist or Play Lab (this is likely the longest stage of the project). Finally, students will be able to present their finished work to their peers."
            The Design Process:
              name: The Design Process
              description_student: Projects this big take time and plenty planning. Here, you will learn about the design process that you'll use to build your own creation.
              description_teacher: Over the course of four lessons, students will be building up to programming a project of their own design using either Play Lab or Artist as their programming environment. In this portion of the project, students will learn about the design process and how to implement it in their own projects. The lesson guide for all four stages of the process can be found in the first stage of this project process [here](https://curriculum.code.org/csf/coursee/12/).

            Conditionals:
              name: Conditionals in Farmer
              description_student: You will get to tell the computer what to do under certain conditions in this fun and challenging series.
              description_teacher: This lesson introduces students to `while` loops and `if / else` statements. _While loops_ are loops that continue to repeat commands as long as a condition is true. While loops are used when the programmer doesn't know the exact number of times the commands need to be repeated, but the programmer does know what condition needs to be true in order for the loop to continue looping. `If / Else` statements offer flexibility in programming by running entire sections of code only if something is true, otherwise it runs something else.
            Private and Personal Information:
              name: 'Digital Citizenship: Private and Personal Information'
              description_student: The internet is fun and exciting, but it's important to stay safe too. This lesson teaches you the difference between information that is safe to share and information that is private.
              description_teacher: |-
                Developed by Common Sense Education, this lesson is about the difference between information that is safe to share online and information that is not.

                As students visit sites that request information about their identities, they learn to adopt a critical inquiry process that empowers them to protect themselves and their families from identity theft. In this lesson, students learn to think critically about the user information that some websites request or require. They learn the difference between private information and personal information, as well as how to distinguish what is safe or unsafe to share online.
            Build a Star Wars Game:
              name: Build a Star Wars Game
              description_student: Feel the force as you build your own Star Wars game in this lesson.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students will practice using events to build a game that they can share online. Featuring R2-D2 and other Star Wars characters, students will be guided through events, then given space to create their own game.
            'Functions: Songwriting':
              name: 'Functions: Songwriting'
              description_student: Even rockstars need programming skills. This lesson will teach you about functions using lyrics from songs.
              description_teacher: One of the most magnificent structures in the computer science world is the function. Functions (sometimes called procedures) are mini programs that you can use over and over inside of your bigger program. This lesson will help students intuitively understand why combining chunks of code into functions can be such a helpful practice.
            Functions in Artist:
              name: Functions in Artist
              description_student: Make complex drawings more easily with functions!
              description_teacher: Students will be introduced to using functions on Code.org. Magnificent images will be created and modified with functions in Artist. For more complicated patterns, students will learn about nesting functions by calling one function from inside another.
            Functions in Bee:
              name: Functions in Bee
              description_student: Don't write too much code to gather all of the nectar and honey. Use functions instead!
              description_teacher: In the second round of practice with online functions, students will navigate complex paths, collect plenty of nectar, and make lots of honey.
            Functions in Farmer:
              name: Functions in Farmer
              description_student: Functions will save you lots of work as you help the farmer with her harvest!
              description_teacher: Students have practiced creating impressive designs in Artist and navigating mazes in Bee, but today they will use functions to harvest crops in Farmer. This lesson will push students to use functions in the new ways by combining them with `while` loops and `if / else` statements.
            Determine the Concept:
              name: Determine the Concept
              description_student: "We aren't giving away any secrets! \nThis lesson could use any of the skills you've learned so far."
              description_teacher: This lesson brings together concepts from the previous lessons and gives students a chance to think critically about how they would solve each problem, but without telling them which concept to apply. Students will review basic algorithms, debugging, `repeat` loops, conditionals, `while` loops, and functions.
            Build a Play Lab Game:
              name: Build a Play Lab Game
              description_student: Practice making games to share with your friends and family.
              description_teacher: This lesson features Play Lab, a platform where students can create their own games and have interactions between characters and user input. Students will work with events to create keyboard controls. This set of puzzles will also loosely guide students through game development, but with freedom to add their own ideas.
            Present Your Project:
              name: Present Your Project
              description_student: Get ready to show off! It's time to present your finished project to your peers.
              description_teacher: Over the course of four lessons, students will be building up to programming a project of their own design using either Play Lab or Artist as their programming environment. Finally, students will be able to present their finished work to their peers or share with their loved ones with a special link. The lesson guide for all four stages of the process can be found in the first stage of this project process [here](https://curriculum.code.org/csf/coursee/12/).
            Internet:
              name: 'Beyond Programming: The Internet'
              description_student: Ever wondered how information travels across the internet? It's not magic! This lesson will teach you the basics of how the internet works.
              description_teacher: Even though many people use the internet daily, not very many know how it works. In this lesson, students will pretend to flow through the internet, all the while learning about connections, URLs, IP Addresses, and the DNS.
            Crowdsourcing:
              name: 'Beyond Programming: Crowdsourcing'
              description_student: This lesson will teach you about crowdsourcing, the process of building a project with a team.
              description_teacher: In computer science, we face some big, daunting problems.

              description_teacher: Variables are used as placeholders for values such as numbers or words. Variables allow for a lot of freedom in programming. Instead of having to type out a phrase many times or remember an obscure number, computer scientists can use variables to reference them. This lesson helps to explain what variables are and how we can use them in many different ways. The idea of variables isn't an easy concept to grasp, so we recommend allowing plenty of time for discussion at the end of the lesson.
            Variables in Artist:
              name: Variables in Artist
              description_student: Don't forget to bring creativity to class! In these puzzles you will be making fantastic drawings using variables.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students will explore the creation of repetitive designs using variables in the Artist environment. Students will learn how variables can be used to make code easier to write and easier to read. After guided puzzles, students will end in a freeplay level to show what they have learned and create their own designs.
            Variables in Play Lab:
              name: Variables in Play Lab
              description_student: Soon you will learn about making characters interact in a game using variables!

              description_student: You're going to have loads of fun learning about `for` loops!
              description_teacher: 'We know that loops allow us to do things over and over again, but now we’re going to learn how to use loops that have extra structures built right in. These new structures will allow students to create code that is more powerful and dynamic. '
            For Loops in Bee:
              name: For Loops in Bee
              description_student: Buzz buzz. In these puzzles you will be guiding a bee to nectar and honey using `for` loops!
              description_teacher: Featuring Bee, this lesson focuses on for loops and using an incrementing variable to solve more complicated puzzles. Students will begin by reviewing loops from previous lessons, then walked through using for loops to more effectively solve complicated problems.
            For Loops in Artist:
              name: For Loops in Artist
              description_student: Get ready to make your next masterpiece. Here you will be using `for` loops to make some jaw-dropping pictures.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students continue to practice for loops, this time with Artist.

              name: 'Functions: Songwriting with Parameters'
              description_student: You just might release the next big hit single! In this lesson, you will be learning what parameters are and how they make some fantastic songs!
              description_teacher: One of the most magnificent structures in the computer science world is the function. Functions (sometimes called procedures) are mini programs that you can use over and over inside of your bigger program. This lesson will help students intuitively understand why combining chunks of code into functions is such a helpful practice, and how they can use those structures even when chunks of code are slightly different.
            Conditionals and Functions in Bee:
              name: Conditionals and Functions in Bee
              description_student: The bee needs your help again! Here you will be using functions to get nectar and make honey!

            Functions with Parameters in Bee:
              name: Functions with Parameters in Bee
              description_student: You've had a little practice using functions with parameters. This lesson will continue your practice with Bee!
              description_teacher: This lesson features the bee environment, and continues along the concept of functions with parameters from the previous Artist stage. Students will practice writing and using functions to follow complex paths and collect patterns of nectar and honey.
            Explore Project Ideas:
              name: Explore Project Ideas
              description_student: Time to get some inspiration! These puzzles will show you a handful of pre-built games and illustrations to help develop your plan for your BIG project.
              description_teacher: "The next five lessons provide an opportunity for students to put their coding skills to use in a capstone project. This project will help individuals gain experience with coding and produce an exemplar to share with peers and loved ones. This is intended to be a multi-lesson or multi-week project where students spend time brainstorming, learning about the design process, building, and then presenting their final work. \n\nIn the explore stage, students will be able to view examples of projects in both Artist and Play Lab for inspiration. Next, students will learn about the design process and how to implement it in their own projects. They will then be given the space to create their own project in either Artist or Play Lab (this is most likely the longest stage of the project).

          description_short: Learn how people use computers to solve data problems.
          description: Unit 5 is about the importance of data in solving problems and highlights how computers can help in this process. The first chapter explores different systems used to represent information in a computer and the challenges and tradeoffs posed by using them. In the second chapter you’ll learn how collections of data are used to solve problems, and how computers help to automate the steps of this process. The chapter concludes by considering how the data problem solving process can be applied to an area of the your choosing.

            Plotting Shapes:
              name: Plotting Shapes
              description_student: Students explore the challenges of communicating how to draw with shapes and use a tool that introduces how this problem is approached in Game Lab. The warm up activity quickly demonstrates the challenges of communicating position without some shared reference point. In the main activity students explore a Game Lab tool that allows students to interactively place shapes on Game Lab's 400 by 400 grid. They then take turns instructing a partner how to draw a hidden image using this tool, accounting for many challenges students will encounter when programming in Game Lab. Students optionally create their own image to communicate before a debrief discussion.

            Variables:
              name: Variables
              description_student: This lesson introduces variables as a way to label a number in a program or save a randomly generated value. The class begins the lesson with a very basic description of the purpose of a variable and practices using the new blocks.  Afterwards, the class uses variables to save a random number, allowing the programs to use the same random number multiple times.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students learn how to use variables to label a number in their program or save a randomly generated value. Students begin the lesson with a very basic description of the purpose of a variable. Students then complete a level progression that reinforces the model of a variable as a way to label or name a number. Students use variables to save a random number to see that variables actually store or save their values, allowing them to use the same random number multiple times in their programs.
            Sprites:
              name: Sprites
              description_student: In order to create more interesting and detailed images, the class is introduced to the sprite object. Every sprite can be assigned an image to show, and sprites also keep track of multiple values about themselves, which will prove useful down the road when making animations.  At the end of the lesson, everyone creates a scene using sprites.

            The Draw Loop:
              name: The Draw Loop
              description_student: This lesson introduces the draw loop, one of the core programming paradigms in Game Lab.  The class combines the draw loop with random numbers to manipulate some simple animations with dots and then with sprites. Afterwards, everyone uses what they learned to update the sprite scene from the previous lesson.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students are introduced to the draw loop, one of the core programming paradigms in Game Lab. To begin the lesson students look at some physical flipbooks to see that having many frames with different images creates the impression of motion. Students then watch a video explaining how the draw loop in Game Lab helps to create this same impression in their programs. Students combine the draw loop with random numbers to manipulate some simple animations with dots and then with sprites. At the end of the lesson students use what they learned to update their sprite scene from the previous lesson.
            The Counter Pattern Unplugged:
              name: The Counter Pattern Unplugged
              description_student: This unplugged lesson explores the underlying behavior of variables. Using notecards and string to simulate variables within a program, the class implements a few short programs. Once comfortable with this syntax, the class uses the same process with sprite properties, tracking a sprite's progress across the screen.

            Booleans Unplugged:
              name: Booleans Unplugged
              description_student: This lesson introduces boolean values and logic, as well as conditional statements. The class starts by playing a simple game of Stand Up, Sit Down in which the boolean (true/false) statements describe personal properties (hair or eye color, clothing type, age, etc). The class then groups objects based on increasingly complex boolean statements, then looks at how conditionals can impact the flow of a program.
              description_teacher: |-
                In this lesson, students are introduced to boolean values and logic, as well as conditional statements. The class starts by playing a simple game of Stand Up, Sit Down in which the boolean (true/false) statements describe personal properties (hair or eye color, clothing type, age, etc). This gets students thinking about how they can frame a property with multiple potential values (such as age) with a binary question.

                From there students are provided a group of objects with similar, yet varying, physical properties. With a partner they group those objects based on increasingly complex boolean statements, including compound booleans with AND and OR.

                Finally we reveal Conditionals as a tool to make decisions or impact the flow of a program using boolean statements as input.
            Conditionals:
              name: Conditionals
              description_student: The class starts by using booleans to compare the current value of a sprite property with a target value, using that comparison to determine when a sprite has reached a point on the screen, grown to a given size, or otherwise reached a value using the counter pattern. After using booleans directly to investigate the values or sprite properties, the class adds conditional if statements to write code that responds to those boolean comparisons.

After using booleans directly to investigate the values or sprite properties, students add conditional _if_ statements to write code that responds to those boolean comparisons.
            Keyboard Input:
              name: Keyboard Input
              description_student: Following the introduction to booleans and if statements in the previous lesson, students are introduced to a new block called keyDown() which returns a boolean and can be used in conditionals statements to move sprites around the screen. By the end of this lesson students will have written programs that take keyboard input from the user to control sprites on the screen.
              description_teacher: Following the introduction to booleans and _if_ statements in the previous lesson, students are introduced to a new block called `keyDown()` which returns a boolean and can be used in conditionals statements to move sprites around the screen. By the end of this lesson students will have written programs that take keyboard input from the user to control sprites on the screen.
            Other Forms of Input:
              name: Other Forms of Input
              description_student: The class continues to explore ways to use conditional statements to take user input. In addition to the simple keyDown() command learned yesterday, the class learns about several other keyboard input commands as well as ways to take mouse input.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students continue to explore ways to use conditional statements to take user input. In addition to the simple `keyDown()` command learned yesterday, students will learn about several other keyboard input commands as well as ways to take mouse input.
            Project - Interactive Card:
              name: Project - Interactive Card
              description_student: In this cumulative project for Chapter 1, the class plans for and develops an interactive greeting card using all of the programming techniques they've learned to this point.

            Velocity:
              name: Velocity
              description_student: After a brief review of how the counter pattern is used to move sprites, the class is introduced to the properties that set velocity and rotation speed directly.   As they use these new properties in different ways, they build up the skills they need to create a basic side scroller game.
              description_teacher: After a brief review of how they used the counter pattern to move sprites in previous lessons, students are introduced to the properties that set velocity and rotation speed directly.

            Collision Detection:
              name: Collision Detection
              description_student: The class learns about collision detection on the computer.  Pairs explore how a computer could use sprite location and size properties and math to detect whether two sprites are touching.  The class then uses the isTouching() block to create different effects when sprites collide, including playing sounds.  Last, they use their new skills to improve the sidescroller game that they started in the last lesson.

            Complex Sprite Movement:
              name: Complex Sprite Movement
              description_student: 'The class learns to combine the velocity properties of sprites with the counter pattern to create more complex sprite movement, such as simulating gravity, making a sprite jump, and allowing a sprite to float left or right. In the final levels the class combine these movements to animate and control a single sprite and build a simple game in which a character flies around and collects coins. '
              description_teacher: Students learn to combine the velocity properties of sprites with the counter pattern to create more complex sprite movement. In particular students will learn how to simulate gravity, make a sprite jump, and allow a sprite to float left or right. In the final levels of the Code Studio progression students combine these movements to animate and control a single sprite and build a simple game in which a character flies around and collects a coin. Students are encouraged to make their own additions to the game in the final level.
            Collisions:
              name: Collisions
              description_student: The class programs their sprites to interact in new ways.  After a brief review of how they used the isTouching block, the class brainstorms other ways that two sprites could interact.  They then use isTouching to make one sprite push another across the screen before practicing with the four collision blocks (collide, displace, bounce, and bounceOff).
              description_teacher: Students program their sprites to interact in new ways.  After a brief review of how they used the `isTouching` block, students brainstorm other ways that two sprites could interact.  They then use `isTouching` to make one sprite push another across the screen before practicing with the four collision blocks (`collide`, `displace`, `bounce`, and `bounceOff`).
            Functions:
              name: Functions
              description_student: This lesson covers functions as a way to organize their code, make it more readable, and remove repeated blocks of code. The class learns that higher level or more abstract steps make it easier to understand and reason about steps, then begins to create functions in Game Lab.  At the end of the lesson the class uses these skills to organize and add functionality to the final version of their side scroller game.
              description_teacher: Students learn how to create functions to organize their code, make it more readable, and remove repeated blocks of code. An unplugged warmup explores how directions at different levels of detail can be useful depending on context. Students learn that higher level or more abstract steps make it easier to understand and reason about steps. Afterwards students learn to create functions in Game Lab. They will use functions to remove long blocks of code from their draw loop and to replace repeated pieces of code with a single function. At the end of the lesson students use these skills to organize and add functionality to the final version of their side scroller game.
            The Game Design Process:
              name: The Game Design Process
              description_student: This lesson introduces the process the class will use to design games for the remainder of the unit. The class walks through through this process in a series of levels. As part of this lesson the class also briefly learn to use multi-frame animations in Game Lab. At the end of the lesson they have an opportunity to make improvements to the game to make it their own.
              description_teacher: This lesson introduces students to the process they will use to design games for the remainder of the unit. This process is centered around a project guide which asks students to define their sprites, variables, and functions before they begin programming their game. In this lesson students begin by playing a game on Game Lab where the code is hidden. They discuss what they think the sprites, variables, and functions would need to be to make the game. They are then given a completed project guide which shows one way to implement the game. Students are then walked through this process through a series of levels. As part of this lesson students also briefly learn to use multi-frame animations in Game Lab. At the end of the lesson students have an opportunity to make improvements to the game to make it their own.
            Using the Game Design Process:
              name: Using the Game Design Process
              description_student: In this multi-day lesson, the class uses the problem solving process from Unit 1 to create a platform jumper game.  After looking at a sample game, the class defines what their games will look like and uses a structured process to build them.  Finally, the class reflects on how the games could be improved, and implements those changes.
              description_teacher: In this multi-day lesson, students use the problem solving process from Unit 1 to create a platform jumper game.  They start by looking at an example of a platform jumper, then define what their games will look like.  Next, they use a structured process to plan the backgrounds, variables, sprites, and functions they will need to implement their game.  After writing the code for the game, students will reflect on how the game could be improved, and implement those changes.
            Project - Design a Game:
              name: Project - Design a Game
              description_student: The class plans and builds original games using the project guide from the previous two lessons. Working individually or in pairs, the class plans, develops, and gives feedback on the games.  After incorporating the peer feedback, the class shares out the completed games.
              description_teacher: Students will plan and build their own game using the project guide from the previous two lessons to guide their project. Working individually or in pairs, students will first decide on the type of game they'd like to build, taking as inspiration a set of sample games. They will then complete a blank project guide where they will describe the game's behavior and scope out the variables, sprites, and functions they'll need to build. In Code Studio, a series of levels prompts them on a general sequence they can use to implement this plan. Partway through the process, students will share their projects for peer review and will incorporate feedback as they finish their game. At the end of the lesson, students will share their completed games with their classmates. This project will span multiple classes and can easily take anywhere from 3-5 class periods.

            Intro to HTML:
              name: Intro to HTML
              description_student: This lesson introduces to HTML as a solution to the problem of how to communicate both the content and structure of a website to a computer. The lesson begins with a brief unplugged activity demonstrating the challenges of effectively communicating the structure of a web page. The class looks at an HTML page in Web Lab and discusses how HTML tags help solve this problem, then uses HTML to write the first web pages of the unit.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students are introduced HTML as a solution to the problem of how to communicate both the content and structure of a website to a computer. The lesson begins with a brief unplugged activity demonstrating the challenges of effectively communicating the structure of a web page. Students then look at an exemplar HTML page in Web Lab and discuss with their classmates how HTML tags help solve this problem. Students then write their first HTML. A wrap-up discussion helps to solidify the understanding of content vs. structure that was developed throughout the lesson.
            Headings:
              name: Headings
              description_student: This lesson continues the introduction to HTML tags, this time with headers.  The class practices using header tags to create page and section titles and learns how the different header elements are displayed by default.  Next, the class plans how to organize their content on the personal web pages that will be built across the unit and begins the first page of the project.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students continue to use HTML to structure text on web pages, this time with headings.  Students learn how the different heading elements are displayed by default and practice using them to create page and section titles.  Students then start to decide how they will organize their content on their own personal web pages.  In the last level, students begin the project that they will continue to work on throughout the unit.
            Digital Footprint:
              name: Digital Footprint
              description_student: This lesson takes a step back from creating the personal website to talk about personal information people choose to share digitally.  The class begins by discussing what types of information are good to share with other people, then looks at several sample social media pages to see what types of personal information could be shared intentionally or unintentionally.  Finally, the class comes up with a set of guidelines to follow when putting information online.
              description_teacher: "As students have recently spent some time thinking about the actual content that will go into their personal website, this lesson takes a step back from the unit-long project (publication of a personal website) to help students articulate what personal information they choose to share digitally and with whom.  It also reinforces the notion that much of the information that they choose to share digitally falls largely out of their control the moment it is released.  \r\n\r\nStudents begin by individually identifying appropriate audiences with whom they would be comfortable sharing given pieces of personal information.  They then look at several social media pages to determine what sorts of information people are sharing about themselves or one another.  Last, students reflect on what guidelines they think are appropriate for posting information online.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate point of this lesson is not to scare students, but rather to experientially bring students to realizing precisely what level of control they don’t have in releasing information into the web."
            Lists:
              name: Lists
              description_student: This lesson introduces ordered and unordered lists and the associated  &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, and &lt;li&gt; HTML tags.  The class practices using the tags, then goes back to the personal web page project to add a new HTML page that includes the new tags.
              description_teacher: Students are introduced to ordered and unordered lists in HTML and work through a few levels in which they use the &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, and &lt;li&gt; tags.  They then go back to their project, where they add a new HTML page.  Inside the new page, they write the HTML to display a recipe, top ten list, or any other content that uses the new tags that they have learned.
            Intellectual Property and Images:
              name: Intellectual Property and Images
              description_student: This lesson covers how to use media such as images, video, or music created by others a website while respecting the rights of the creator of that media. After first studying Creative Commons licensing, the class learns how to add images to web pages, and how to give proper attribution when doing so.
              description_teacher: "Starting with a discussion of their personal opinions on how others should be allowed to use their work, the class explores the purpose and role of copyright for both creators and users of creative content.  They then move on to an activity exploring the various Creative Commons licenses as a solution to the difficulty in dealing with copyright. \n\nFinally, with a common understanding of the restrictions of various Creative Commons licenses, students learn how to add images to their web pages using the &lt;img&gt; tag."

          title: CSD Unit 6 - Physical Computing ('18-'19)
          description: Unit 6 explores the role of hardware platforms in computing and how different sensors can provide more effective input and output than the traditional keyboard, mouse, and monitor. Using App Lab and Adafruit’s Circuit Playground, you’ll develop programs that utilize the same hardware inputs and outputs that you see in the smart devices, looking at how a simple rough prototype can lead to a finished product. The unit concludes with a design challenge to use the Circuit Playground as the basis for an innovation of your own design.

              description_teacher: In this lesson, students will relate the concept of algorithms back to real-life activities by playing the Dice Race game. The goal here is to start building the skills to translate real-world situations to online scenarios and vice versa.
            Introduction:
              name: Introduction
              description_student: This fast-paced introduction will give you the chance to practice most of the skills that you will need to solve the puzzles in this course.
              description_teacher: In this progression, students will begin with an introduction (or review depending on the experience of your class) of Code.org's online workspace. Students will learn the basic functionality of the interface including the `Run`, `Reset`, and `Step` buttons. Dragging, deleting, and connecting Blockly blocks is also introduced in the beginning video. In the puzzles, students will practice their sequencing and debugging skills in Maze and Artist.
            Conditionals:

              description_teacher: This lesson introduces students to `while` loops and `if / else` statements. _While loops_ are loops that continue to repeat commands as long as a condition is true. While loops are used when the programmer doesn't know the exact number of times the commands need to be repeated, but the programmer does know what condition needs to be true in order for the loop to continue looping. `If / Else` statements offer flexibility in programming by running entire sections of code only if something is true, otherwise it runs something else.
            Private and Personal Information:
              name: Private and Personal Information
              description_student: The internet is fun and exciting, but it's important to stay safe too. This lesson teaches you the difference between information that is safe to share and information that is private.

At the end of the lesson groups reflect on their experiences with the activity and make connections to the types of problem solving they will be doing for the rest of the course. '
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students work in groups to design aluminum foil boats that will support as many pennies as possible. Groups have two rounds to work on their boats, with the goal of trying to hold more pennies than they did in round 1. The structure of the activity foreshadows different steps of the problem solving process that students will be introduced to in more detail in the following lesson. At the end of the lesson students reflect on their experiences with the activity and make connections to the types of problem solving they will be doing for the rest of the course.
            The Problem Solving Process:
              name: The Problem Solving Process
              description_student: This lesson introduces the formal problem solving process that the class will use over the course of the year, Define - Prepare - Try - Reflect.  The class relates these steps to the aluminum boats problem from the previous lesson, then a problem they are good at solving, then a problem they want to improve at solving. At the end of the lesson the class collects a list of generally useful strategies for each step of the process to put on posters that will be used throughout the unit and year.
              description_teacher: This lesson introduces the formal problem solving process that students will use over the course of the year, Define - Prepare - Try - Reflect. The lesson begins by asking students to brainstorm all the different types of problems that they encounter in everyday life. Students are then shown the four steps of the problem solving process and work together to relate these abstract steps to their actual experiences solving problems. First students relate these steps to the aluminum boats problem from the previous lesson, then a problem they are good at solving, then a problem they want to improve at solving. At the end of the lesson the class collects a list of generally useful strategies for each step of the process to put on posters that will be used throughout the unit and year.

They will solve a word search, arrange seating for a birthday party, and plan a trip. The problems grow increasingly complex and poorly defined to highlight how the problem solving process is particularly helpful when tackling these types of problems. The lesson concludes with students reflecting on their experience with the problem solving process. They will justify the inclusion of each step and will brainstorm questions or strategies that can help them better define open-ended problems, as this is often the most critical step.\r\n\r\nThis lesson will likely take two class periods or more to complete. The first two problems may fit into a single class period but the third will need to be moved to a second day."

              description_student: In this lesson the class develops a preliminary definition of a computer. After brainstorming the possible definitions for a computer, the class works in groups to sort pictures into “is a computer” or “is not a computer” on poster paper and explain their motivations for choosing some of the most difficult categorizations.  The teacher then introduces a definition of the computer and allows groups to revise their posters according to the new definition.
              description_teacher: "In this lesson students develop a preliminary definition of a computer. To begin the lesson, the class will brainstorm possible definitions for a computer and place the results of this brainstorm on the board. Next, students will work in groups to sort pictures into “is a computer” or “is not a computer” on poster paper. Groups will place their posters around the room and briefly explain their motivations for choosing some of their most difficult categorizations.

To conclude the lesson the class examines common activities they do on a computing device and select the inputs and outputs used for that activity from the chart.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students consider a number of computing devices to determine what types of inputs and outputs they use. Groups are assigned to a computing device and based on a teacher-provided definition of input and output, list the inputs and outputs of their device. Earlier in the activity students are prompted to focus on more obvious physical inputs and outputs (e.g. a keyboard as an input or a screen as an output) but later discussions lead students to consider less obvious examples (e.g. that a touch screen is both an input and output, or the fact that the Internet can serve as both input and output). Throughout the lesson the teacher records inputs and outputs that are identified on a T-Chart at the front of the room. To conclude the lesson students examine common activities they do on a computing device and select the inputs and outputs used for that activity from the chart.
            Processing:
              name: Processing
              description_student: This lesson dives deeper into the concept of processing that was introduced as part of the definition of a computer.  Pairs work together to put a deck of cards in order, a form of processing information.  In the end, the class discusses what processing means within the context of solving information problems.
              description_teacher: Students complete two unplugged card sorting activities to explore the meaning of processing and its relationship to problem-solving. The first activity has few constraints and is used to introduce a high-level definition of processing. The next introduces more constraints that force students to develop an algorithm that will always successfully process the cards. Students iteratively develop, test, and share their algorithms with classmates. A wrap-up discussion has students reflect on the different types of problem-solving they used in these activities and the value of producing an algorithm to solve a problem.
            Storage:
              name: Storage
              description_student: This lesson focuses on the storage component of the definition of a computer, within the content of processing information. The class spends the majority of the lesson developing and sharing algorithms to process information, with an emphasis on how much storage is needed for any particular algorithm. The lesson concludes with a discussion of the importance of storage while processing information.
              description_teacher: Students explore the importance of storage within the Input-Storage-Processing-Output model of a computer. The warm-up activity asks students to reflect on the types of information they have seen computers store in the past, like documents, photographs, or videos. The unplugged main activity has students develop an algorithm to process a small pile of cards in search of specific cards within the deck. Constraints on how students can move the cards force them to consider the importance of storage even while they are processing the deck. The lesson concludes with a discussion of the two types of storage students saw in this lesson and the importance of storage while processing information.

            Analysis of Design:
              name: Analysis of Design
              description_student: The class explores a variety of different teapot designs to consider how design choices or made and why. Using the teapots as an example, the class will explore the relationship between users, their needs, and the design of objects they use.
              description_teacher: To kick off a unit devoted to group problem solving and developing products for other users, students begin by investigating the design of various teapots. Students analyze each teapot, attempting to identify how specific user needs might have informed its design. By considering these design choices, and attempting to match each teapot with a potential user, students can begin to see how taking a user-centered approach to designing products (both physical and digital) can make those products more useful and usable. To conclude the activity, students are asked to propose some changes to one of the teapots that would make it more useful or usable.
            Understanding Your User:
              name: Understanding Your User
              description_student: Using user profiles, the class explores how different users might react to a variety of products. Role playing as a different person, each member of the class will get to experience designs through someone else's eyes.
              description_teacher: "Designers need to understand their users’ needs in order to create useful products.  This lesson encourages students to think about how to design for another person by role-playing as someone else using a user profile and reacting as that user to a series of products.  Each student is assigned a user profile describing a person, which they then use to choose appropriate products, critique product design, and suggest improvements to design.\r\n"
            User-Centered Design Micro Activity:
              name: User-Centered Design Micro Activity
              description_student: In small groups, the class uses the design process to come up with ideas for smart clothing. From brainstorming, to identifying users, to finally proposing a design, this is the first of several opportunities in this unit to practicing designing a solution for the needs of others.
              description_teacher: This lesson guides students through an abbreviated version of the design process they will be seeing throughout this unit. Students first brainstorm a list of potential users of smart clothing. As a class, they then group these ideas into broad categories and each group will choose one category of user. Groups repeat this process to brainstorm needs or concerns of their user, eventually categorizing these needs and choosing one to focus on. Finally, students design a piece of smart clothing, using the specific needs and concerns they brainstormed to guide their decision making. At the end of the class students quickly share their decision-making process and get feedback on how well their product addresses the user need they selected.
            User Interfaces:
              name: User Interfaces
              description_student: See how a paper prototype can be used to test and get feedback on software before writing any code. To help out a developer with their idea, the class tests and provides an app prototype made of paper.
              description_teacher: Following the mini design project, students look towards the next phase of design - prototyping a product that attempts to address user needs. In teams, students examine a paper prototype for a chat app called "Txt Ur Grndkdz". Through using this paper prototype, students get a chance to see how a simple paper prototype can be used to quickly test ideas and assumptions before we ever get to the computer. After "using" the provided prototype students begin to identify ways to improve the next iteration.
            Feedback and Testing:
              name: Feedback and Testing
              description_student: Users have been testing an app, and they have lots of feedback for the developer. The class needs to sort through all of this feedback, identify the common themes and needs, and start revising the prototype to make it better meet the users' needs.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students use feedback from "users" of the paper-prototyped app from the previous lesson in order to develop improvements to the user interface of that paper prototype. The lesson begins with a reflection on the fact that designers need to translate human needs with technology into changes to the user interface or experience. Students are then given a collection of feedback and requests from users of the app from the previous lesson. In groups students categorize the feedback and identify ways the needs expressed in the feedback could be met by changes to the interface of the app. Then in groups students will implement some of these changes to meet one of the needs they identified.
            Identifying User Needs:
              name: Identifying User Needs
              description_student: Up to this point the users that the class has considered have all been remote, and the only information from users has come through text or role playing. Now the class will rely on each other as potential users, and pairs will get to interview each other to identify needs that could be addressed by developing an app.
              description_teacher: 'Up to this point students have focused on designing for users who are, to some degree, distanced from them. Whether through brainstorming, profiles, or text feedback, the connection to an end user has never been direct. This is distance is designed to help students get outside their own head when thinking about users, but in order to get information more directly from an actual user, students need to rely on their classmates. In this lesson students pair up to become users (and designers) for each other, allowing everyone to directly interview their end user and ask questions to better inform their design. Each student pair interviews each other, attempting to identify a specific need that could be addressed by an app. '
            Project - Paper Prototype:
              name: Project - Paper Prototype
              description_student: Using the interview information from the previous lesson, the class comes up with app ideas to address the needs of their users. To express those ideas, and test out their effectiveness, each student creates and tests paper prototypes of their own.
              description_teacher: Based on the peer interview from the previous lesson, each student comes up with an idea for an app that will address their user's problem. Students then get to create their own paper prototype of their app ideas by drawing "screens" on individual notecards. A project guide directs students through the process including building the app and testing it with their user to see if their assumptions about the user interfaces they created are accurate.
            Designing Apps for Good:
              name: Designing Apps for Good
              description_student: To kick off the app design project, the class organizes into teams and starts exploring app topics. Several example socially impactful apps serve as inspiration for the project.
              description_teacher: To kick off the app design project that lasts through the end of the unit, students first explore a number of apps designed for social impact that have been created by other students. The class then reviews the Define, Prepare, Try, and Reflect steps of the Problem Solving process as they develop an idea for an app of their own with social impact. Finally, students will form project teams and lay out a contract for how the team will function throughout the development of their app.
            Market Research:
              name: Market Research
              description_student: Dive into app development by exploring existing apps that may serve similar users. Each group identifies a handful of apps that address the same topic they are working on, using those apps to help refine the app idea they will pursue.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students research apps similar to the one they intend on creating to better understand the needs of their users. Students work within their teams to search the Internet for other apps, then evaluate the ones they find interesting. By the end of the lesson, each team will have a clearer idea about the type of app they want to create and further refine who their target users are. Each team will maintain a list of citations for all the apps they examined for use in their final presentation.
            Paper Prototypes:
              name: Paper Prototypes
              description_student: Paper prototypes allow developers to quickly test ideas before investing a lot of time writing code. In this lesson teams explore some example apps created in App Lab, using those apps to help inform the first paper prototypes of their apps.
              description_teacher: "Before starting to design apps, we need to help students to better scope their expectations. Because students will eventually be prototyping these apps in App Lab, they will be in better shape if their ideas align with the kinds of apps that are easily prototyped in App Lab. Teams start this scoping by looking through several example apps designed to demonstrate apps that can be created with App Lab. Teams then can chose one (or more) of the apps as a basis for their own. From there, teams have some time to discuss the basic functionality of their app before using 3x5 index cards to develop paper prototypes.\r\n"
            Prototype Testing:
              name: Prototype Testing
              description_student: In this lesson teams test out their paper prototypes with other members of the class. With one student role playing the computer, one narrating, and the rest observing, teams will get immediate feedback on their app designs which will inform the next version of their app prototypes.
              description_teacher: The primary purpose of developing paper prototypes is that they allow for quick testing and iteration before any code is written. This lesson is focused on giving teams a chance to test their prototypes before moving to App Lab. Teams develop a plan to test with users before running prototype tests with multiple other students in the class (and potentially outside the class). In order to test the prototype with the users, the students will have to assign roles in the testing (the “narrator”, the “computer” and the “observers”) as well as have some questions prepared for the user to answer after the test is complete.
            Digital Design:
              name: Digital Design
              description_student: Having developed, tested, and gathered feedback on a paper prototype, teams now move to App Lab to build the next iteration of their apps. Using the drag-and-drop Design Mode, each team member builds out at least one page of their team's app, responding to feedback that was received in the previous round of testing.
              description_teacher: Having collaboratively developed a paper prototype for their apps, groups now divide and conquer to begin work on an interactive digital version based on the paper prototype. Using the drag-and-drop design mode of App Lab, students individually work through a progression of skill-building levels to learn how to build digital versions of a paper prototype. From there, each group member builds out at least one page of their app in App Lab, to be later combined into a single app.
            Linking Screens:
              name: Linking Screens
              description_student: Building on the screens that the class designed in the previous lesson, teams combine screens into a single app. Simple code can then be added to make button clicks change to the appropriate screen.
              description_teacher: In this lesson teams combine the screens that they designed in the previous lesson into a single app, which they can then link together using code. Students learn basic event driven programming by building up the model app that they started in the previous lesson. In addition to the screen that students designed yesterday, they'll learn how to create additional screens and even import screens made by others.
            Testing the App:
              name: Testing the App
              description_student: Teams run another round of user testing, this time with their interactive prototype. Feedback gathered from this round of testing will inform the final iteration of the app prototypes.
              description_teacher: 'By the end of the previous lesson each team should have a minimum viable prototype of their app. The primary purpose of this lesson is to have the team actually test the app with other people, preferably from the target audience the app is intended for, or from different teams in the class while observers from the team will record the results on the worksheets they used in the planning phase. As with testing the paper prototypes, teams will start by planning for the specific scenarios before running and observing tests. '
            Improving and Iterating:
              name: Improving and Iterating
              description_student: Using the feedback from the last round of testing, teams implement changes that address the needs of their users. Each team tracks and prioritizes the features they want to add and the bugs they need to fix.
              description_teacher: Teams have at this point developed an app prototype that has gone through multiple iterations and rounds of user testing. With the information and guidance gained from the last round of user testing, each student has the opportunity to plan for and implement improvements to the team app. Depending on the time you have available, and student interest, you can run the cycle of testing and iteration as many times as you see fit.
            Project - App Presentation:
              name: Project - App Presentation
              description_student: Each team prepares a presentation to "pitch" the app they've developed. This is the time to share struggles, triumphs, and plans for the future.
              description_teacher: At this point teams have researched a topic of personal and social importance, developed and tested both a paper prototype and a digital prototype, and iterated on the initial app to incorporate new features and bug fixes. Now is the time for them to review what they have done and pull together a coherent presentation to demonstrate their process of creation. Using the provided presentation template, teams prepare to present about their process of app development, including the problem they set out to solve, the ways in which they've incorporated feedback from testing, and their plans for the future.
            CS Discoveries Post-Course Survey:
              name: CS Discoveries Post-Course Survey
          student_description: Unit 4 introduces the broader social impacts of computing. Through a series of design challenges, you will learn how to better understand the needs of others while developing a solution to a problem. The second half of the unit consists of an iterative team project, during which teams have the opportunity to identify a need that they care about, prototype solutions both on paper and in App Lab, and test solutions with real users to get feedback and drive further iteration.

            Representation Matters:
              name: Representation Matters
              description_student: This first lesson provides an overview of what data is and how it is used to solve problems.  Groups use a data set to make a series of meal recommendations for people with various criteria.   Afterwards, groups compare their responses and discuss how the different representations of the meal data affected how the students were able to solve the different problems.
              description_teacher: In the first lesson of the data unit, students get an overview of what data is and how it is used to solve problems.  Students start off with a brief discussion to come to a common understanding of data.  They then split into groups and use a data set to make a series of meal recommendations for people with various criteria.  Each group has the choices of meal represented in a different way (pictures, recipes, menu, nutrition) that gives an advantage for one of the recommendations.  Afterwards, groups compare their responses and discuss how the different representations of the meal data affected how the students were able to solve the different problems.
            Patterns and Representation:
              name: Patterns and Representation
              description_student: This lesson looks closer at what is needed to create a system of representation.  Groups create systems that can represent any letter in the alphabet using only a single stack of cards, then create messages with their systems and exchange with other groups to ensure the system worked as intended.   The class discusses commonalities between working systems while recognizing that there are many possible working solutions.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students create their own system for representing information. They begin by brainstorming all the different systems they already use to represent yes-no responses. They then work in small groups to create a system that can represent any letter in the alphabet using only a single stack of cards. The cards used have one of 6 different possible drawings (6 animals, 6 colors, etc.) and so to represent the entire alphabet students will need to use patterns of multiple cards to represent each letter. Students create messages with their systems and exchange with other groups to ensure the system worked as intended. In the wrap-up discussion the class  reviews any pros and cons of the different systems. They discuss commonalities between working systems and recognize that there are many possible solutions to this problem and what's important is that everyone use the same arbitrary system to communicate.
            ASCII and Binary Representation:
              name: ASCII and Binary Representation
              description_student: This lesson introduces a formal binary system for encoding information, the ASCII system for representing letters and other characters. At the beginning of the lesson the teacher introduces the fact that computers must represent information using either "on" or "off". The class is then introduced to the ASCII system for representing text using binary symbols and practices using this system before encoding their own messages using ASCII.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students learn to use their first binary system for encoding information, the ASCII system for representing letters and other characters. At the beginning of the lesson the teacher introduces the fact that computers must represent information using either "on" or "off". Then students are introduced to the ASCII system for representing text using binary symbols. Students practice using this system before encoding their own message using ASCII. At the end of the lesson a debrief conversation helps synthesize the key learning objectives of the activity.
            Representing Images:
              name: Representing Images
              description_student: This lesson continues the study of binary representation systems, this time with images. The class is introduced to the concept of splitting images into squares or "pixels" which can then be turned on or off individually to make the entire image. After doing a short set of challenges using the Pixelation Widget, the class makes connections between the system for representing images and the system for representing text they learned in the previous lesson.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students learn how computers represent images. To begin the lesson they consider the challenge of turning all the complexity of vision into a binary pattern. Through a series of images showing how this transformation is made students are introduced to the concept of splitting images into squares or "pixels" which can then be turned on or off individually to make the entire image. Students then do a short set of challenges using the Pixelation Widget in order to draw black and white images. Puzzles are designed to call out some of the challenges of representing images in this way. In the wrap up students make connections between the system for representing images and the system for representing text they learned in the previous lesson.
            Representing Numbers:
              name: Representing Numbers
              description_student: This lesson introduces the binary number system.  With a set of cards that represent the place values in a binary (base-2) number system, the class turns bits "on" or "off" by turning cards face up and face down, then observes the numbers that result from these different patterns.  Eventually, the pattern is extended to a generic 4-bit system.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students learn about the binary number system.  With a set of cards that represent the place values in a binary (base-2) number system by a collection of dots, students turn bits "on" or "off" by turning cards face up and face down, then observe the numbers that result from these different patterns.  Eventually, students extend the pattern to a generic 4-bit system.
            Keeping Data Secret:
              name: Keeping Data Secret
              description_student: Students have a discussion on the different levels of security they would like for personal data.  Once the class has developed an understanding of the importance of privacy, they learn about the process of encrypting information by enciphering a note for a partner and deciphering the partner's note.  The class concludes with a discussion about the importance of both physical and digital security.
              description_teacher: Students have a discussion on the different levels of security they would like for personal data.

            Combining Representations:
              name: Combining Representations
              description_student: This lesson combines all three types of binary representation systems (ASCII characters, binary number, and images) to allow for the encode of more complex types information in a record.  After seeing a series of bits and being asked to decode them, the class is introduced to the idea that  understanding binary information requires understanding both the system that is being used and the meaning of the information encoded.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students use all three types of binary representation systems (ASCII characters, binary number, and images) to decode information in a record.  After seeing a series of bits and being asked to decode them, students are introduced to the idea that in order to understand binary information, they must understand both the system that is being used and the meaning of the information encoded.  They then decode a record representing a pet based on a given structure.
            Project - Create a Representation:
              name: Project - Create a Representation
              description_student: The class designs structure to represent their perfect day using the binary representation systems they've learned in this chapter. After deciding which pieces of information the record should capture, the class will decide how a punch card of bytes of information will be interpreted to represent those pieces of information. Afterwards, everyone will use the ASCII, binary number, and image formats they have learned to represent their perfect days try to decipher what a partner's perfect day is like.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students design a structure to represent their perfect day using the binary representation systems they've learned in this chapter. Students will first write a short description of their perfect day and then review with a partner to identify the key pieces of information they think a computer could capture. As a class students will decide how a punch card of bytes of information will be interpreted to represent those pieces of information. Students will then use the ASCII, binary number, and image formats they have learned to represent their perfect days. Students then trade punch cards and try to decipher what the other student's perfect day is like. The lesson ends with a reflection.
            Problem Solving and Data:
              name: Problem Solving and Data
              description_student: This lesson covers how the problem solving process can be tailored to deal with data problems, in particular.  The class is tasked with deciding what a city most needs to spend resources on.  They must find and use data from the Internet to support their decision.
              description_teacher: 'In this lesson, students use the problem solving process from earlier in the course to solve a data problem.  After reviewing the process, the class is presented with a decision: whether a city should build a library, pet shelter, or fire department.  Students work in teams to collect information on the Internet to help them decide what should be built, then use this information build an argument that will convince the city council of their choice.  They then map what they have done to the problem solving process that they have been using throughout the course, comparing the general problem solving process to its specific application to data problems.'
            Problem Solving with Big Data:
              name: Problem Solving with Big Data
              description_student: This lesson covers how data is collected and used by a organizations to solve problems in the real world. The class looks at three scenarios that could be solved using data and brainstorms the types of data they would want to solve them and how they could collect the data.  Each scenario also includes a video about a real-world service that has solved a similar problem with data.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students look at how data is collected and used by organizations to solve problems in the real world. The lesson begins with a quick review of the data problem solving process they  explored in the last lesson. Then students are presented three scenarios that could be solved using data and brainstorm the types of data they would want to solve them and how they could collect the data. Each problem is designed to reflect a real-world service that exists. After brainstorming, students watch a video about a real-world service and record notes about what data is collected by the real-world service and how it is used. At the end of the lesson, students record whether data was provided actively by a user, was recorded passively, or is collected by sensors.
            Structuring Data:
              name: Structuring Data
              description_student: This lesson goes further into the interpretation of data, including cleaning and visualizing raw data sets.  The class first looks at the how presenting data in different ways can help people to understand it better.  After seeing how cleaning and visualization can help people make better decisions, the class looks at what parts of this process can be automated, and what need a human.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students go further into the collection and interpretation of data, including cleaning and visualizing data.  Students first look at the how presenting data in different ways can help people to understand it better, and they then create visualizations of their own data. Using a the results of a preferred pizza topping survey, students must decide what to do with data that does not easily fit into the visualization scheme that they have chosen.  Finally, students look at which parts of this process can be automated by a computer and which need a human to make decisions.
            Making Decisions with Data:
              name: Making Decisions with Data
              description_student: This lesson gives the class a chance to practice the data problem solving process introduced in the last lesson.  Not all questions have right answers and in some cases the class can and should decide that they should collect more data. The lesson concludes with a discussion of how different people could draw different conclusions from the same data, or how collecting different data might have affected the decisions they made.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students get practice making decisions with data based on some problems designed to be familiar to middle school students. Students work in groups discussing how they would use the data presented to make a decision before the class discusses their final choices. Not all questions have right answers and in some cases students can and should decide that they should collect more data. The lesson concludes with a discussion of how different people could draw different conclusions from the same data, or how collecting different data might have affected the decisions they made.
            Interpreting Data:
              name: Interpreting Data
              description_student: Students begin the lesson by looking at a cake preference survey that allows respondents to specify both a cake and an icing flavor.  They discuss how knowing the relationship between cake and icing preference helps them better decide which combination to recommend.  They are then introduced to cross tabulation, which allows them to graph relationships to different preferences.  They use this technique to find relationships in a preference survey, then brainstorm the different types of problems that this process could help solve.

            Automating Data Decisions:
              name: Automating Data Decisions
              description_student: In this lesson students look at a simple example of how a computer could be used to complete the decision making step of the data problem solving process. Students are given the task of creating an algorithm that could suggest a vacation spot.  Students then create rules, or an algorithm, that a computer could use to make this decision automatically. Students share their rules and what choices their rules would make with the class data. They then use their rules on data from their classmates to test whether their rules would make the same decision that  a person would. The lesson concludes with a discussion about the benefits and drawbacks of using computers to automate the data problem solving process.

The lesson concludes with a discussion about the benefits and drawbacks of using computers to automate the data problem solving process.
            Project - Solve a Data Problem:
              name: Project - Solve a Data Problem
              description_student: To conclude this unit the class designs ways to use data to make a recommendations or predictions to help solve a problem.  In the first several steps the class brainstorms problems, performs simple research, and defines a problem of their choosing. They then decide what kind of data they want to collect, how it could be collected, and how it could be used, before exchanging feedback and giving a final presentation.
              description_teacher: To conclude this unit, students design a recommendation engine based on data that they collect and analyze from their classmates. After looking at an example of a recommendation app, students follow a project guide to complete this multi-day activity. In the first several steps, students choose what choice they want to help the user to make, what data they need to give the recommendation, create a survey, and collect information about their classmates' choices. They then interpret the data and use what they have learned to create the recommendation algorithm.  Last, they use their algorithms to make recommendations to a few classmates. Students perform a peer review and make any necessary updates to their projects before preparing a presentation to the class.

          description: "In the first chapter of this unit students develop skills interpreting visual data and using spreadsheet and visualization tools to create their own digital artifacts.  Through an ongoing project  - the “class data tracker” - students learn how to collect and clean data, and to use a few common tools for computing aggregations and creating visualizations. \r\n\r\nThe second chapter explores the importance of data within apps. App Lab has a number of tools that allow you to collect and use data in your apps. The second chapter provides an overview of how these tools work, a sampling of example projects that can be built using these tools, and a space in which to build and submit a final project."

              description_teacher: Variables are used as placeholders for values such as numbers or words. Variables allow for a lot of freedom in programming. Instead of having to type out a phrase many times or remember an obscure number, computer scientists can use variables to reference them. This lesson helps to explain what variables are and how we can use them in many different ways. The idea of variables isn't an easy concept to grasp, so we recommend allowing plenty of time for discussion at the end of the lesson.
            Variables as Constant in Artist:
              name: Variables with Artist
              description_student: Don't forget to bring creativity to class! In these puzzles you will be making fantastic drawings using variables.

              description_teacher: "The next five lessons provide an opportunity for students to put their coding skills to use in a capstone project. This project will help individuals gain experience with coding and produce an exemplar to share with peers and loved ones. This is intended to be a multi-lesson or multi-week project where students spend time brainstorming, learning about the design process, building, and then presenting their final work. \n\nIn the explore stage, students will be able to view examples of projects in both Artist and Play Lab for inspiration. Next, students will learn about the design process and how to implement it in their own projects. They will then be given the space to create their own project in either Artist or Play Lab (this is most likely the longest stage of the project). Students will then revise their projects, after testing and extra thought. Finally, students will be able to present their finished work to their peers."

              description_teacher: "By the time students reach this lesson, they should already have plenty of practice using `repeat` loops, so now it's time to mix things up. \r\n\r\n_While loops_ are loops that continue to repeat commands while a condition is met. `While` loops are used when the programmer doesn't know the exact number of times commands need to be repeated, but does know what condition needs to be true in order for the loop to continue repeating. For example, students will be working to fill holes and dig dirt in Farmer. They will not know the size of the holes or the height of the mountains of dirt, but the students will know they need to keep filling the holes and digging the dirt as long as the ground is not flat."

              description_student: It's time to play a game where you earn points only under certain conditions!
              description_teacher: "This lesson demonstrates how conditionals can be used to tailor a program to specific information. We don’t always have all of the information we need when writing a program. Sometimes you will want to do something different in one situation than in another, even if you don't know what situation will be true when your code runs. That is where conditionals come in. Conditionals allow a computer to make a decision, based on the information that is true any time your code is run.\r\n\r\n"
            Conditionals in Bee:
              name: If/Else with Bee
              description_student: 'Now that you understand conditionals, it''s time to program Bee to use them when collecting honey and nectar. '
              description_teacher: Up until this point students have been writing code that executes exactly the same way each time it is run - reliable, but not very flexible. In this lesson, your class will begin to code with conditionals, allowing them to write code that functions differently depending on the specific conditions the program encounters.

              description_teacher: In this online activity, students will have the opportunity to push their understanding of loops to a whole new level. Playing with the Bee and Plants vs Zombies, students will learn how to program a loop to be inside of another loop. They will also be encouraged to figure out how little changes in either loop will affect their program when they click `Run`.
            Nested Loops in Artist:
              name: Fancy Shapes using Nested Loops
              description_student: More nested loops! This time, you get to make some AMAZING drawing with nested loops.
              description_teacher: Students will create intricate designs using Artist in today's set of puzzles. By continuing to practice nested loops with new goals, students will see more uses of loops in general. This set of puzzles also offers a lot more potential for creativity with an opportunity for students to create their own design at the end of the stage.

There will be videos pointing out the basic functionality of the workspace including the `Run`, `Reset`, and `Step` buttons. Also discussed in these videos: dragging Blockly blocks, deleting Blockly blocks, and connecting Blockly blocks. Next, students will practice their _sequencing_ and _debugging_ skills in the maze. \r\nDebugging is an essential element of learning to program. Students will encounter some puzzles that have been solved incorrectly. They will need to step through the existing code to identify errors, including incorrect loops, missing blocks, extra blocks, and blocks that are out of order."

            Intro to Problem Solving:
              name: Intro to Problem Solving
              description_student: 'The class works in groups to design aluminum foil boats that will support as many pennies as possible.  At the end of the lesson groups reflect on their experiences with the activity and make connections to the types of problem solving they will be doing for the rest of the course. '
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students work in groups to design aluminum foil boats that will support as many pennies as possible. Groups have two rounds to work on their boats, with the goal of trying to hold more pennies than they did in round 1. The structure of the activity foreshadows different steps of the problem solving process that students will be introduced to in more detail in the following lesson. At the end of the lesson students reflect on their experiences with the activity and make connections to the types of problem solving they will be doing for the rest of the course.
            The Problem Solving Process:
              name: The Problem Solving Process
              description_student: This lesson introduces the formal problem solving process that the class will use over the course of the year, Define - Prepare - Try - Reflect.  The class relates these steps to the aluminum boats problem from the previous lesson, then a problem they are good at solving, then a problem they want to improve at solving. At the end of the lesson the class collects a list of generally useful strategies for each step of the process to put on posters that will be used throughout the unit and year.
              description_teacher: This lesson introduces the formal problem solving process that students will use over the course of the year, Define - Prepare - Try - Reflect. The lesson begins by asking students to brainstorm all the different types of problems that they encounter in everyday life. Students are then shown the four steps of the problem solving process and work together to relate these abstract steps to their actual experiences solving problems. First students relate these steps to the aluminum boats problem from the previous lesson, then a problem they are good at solving, then a problem they want to improve at solving. At the end of the lesson the class collects a list of generally useful strategies for each step of the process to put on posters that will be used throughout the unit and year.
            Exploring Problem Solving:
              name: Exploring Problem Solving
              description_student: 'In this lesson the class applies the problem solving process to three different problems: a word search, a seating arrangement for a birthday party, and planning a trip. The problems grow increasingly complex and poorly defined to highlight how the problem solving process is particularly helpful when tackling these types of problems.'
              description_teacher: "In this lesson students apply the problem solving process to three different problems in order to better understand the value of each step. They will solve a word search, arrange seating for a birthday party, and plan a trip. The problems grow increasingly complex and poorly defined to highlight how the problem solving process is particularly helpful when tackling these types of problems. The lesson concludes with students reflecting on their experience with the problem solving process. They will justify the inclusion of each step and will brainstorm questions or strategies that can help them better define open-ended problems, as this is often the most critical step.\r\n\r\nThis lesson will likely take two class periods or more to complete. The first two problems may fit into a single class period but the third will need to be moved to a second day."
            What is a Computer?:
              name: What is a Computer?
              description_student: In this lesson the class develops a preliminary definition of a computer. After brainstorming the possible definitions for a computer, the class works in groups to sort pictures into “is a computer” or “is not a computer” on poster paper and explain their motivations for choosing some of the most difficult categorizations.  The teacher then introduces a definition of the computer and allows groups to revise their posters according to the new definition.
              description_teacher: "In this lesson students develop a preliminary definition of a computer. To begin the lesson, the class will brainstorm possible definitions for a computer and place the results of this brainstorm on the board. Next, students will work in groups to sort pictures into “is a computer” or “is not a computer” on poster paper. Groups will place their posters around the room and briefly explain their motivations for choosing some of their most difficult categorizations.  The teacher will then introduce a definition of the computer and allow students to revise their posters according to the new definition.\r\n"
            Input and Output:
              name: Input and Output
              description_student: In this the class students consider a number of computing devices to determine what types of inputs and outputs they use. Groups are assigned to a computing device and based on a teacher-provided definition of input and output, list the inputs and outputs of their device.  To conclude the lesson the class examines common activities they do on a computing device and select the inputs and outputs used for that activity from the chart.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students consider a number of computing devices to determine what types of inputs and outputs they use. Groups are assigned to a computing device and based on a teacher-provided definition of input and output, list the inputs and outputs of their device. Earlier in the activity students are prompted to focus on more obvious physical inputs and outputs (e.g. a keyboard as an input or a screen as an output) but later discussions lead students to consider less obvious examples (e.g. that a touch screen is both an input and output, or the fact that the Internet can serve as both input and output). Throughout the lesson the teacher records inputs and outputs that are identified on a T-Chart at the front of the room. To conclude the lesson students examine common activities they do on a computing device and select the inputs and outputs used for that activity from the chart.
            Processing:
              name: Processing
              description_student: This lesson dives deeper into the concept of processing that was introduced as part of the definition of a computer.  Pairs work together to put a deck of cards in order, a form of processing information.  In the end, the class discusses what processing means within the context of solving information problems.
              description_teacher: Students complete two unplugged card sorting activities to explore the meaning of processing and its relationship to problem-solving. The first activity has few constraints and is used to introduce a high-level definition of processing. The next introduces more constraints that force students to develop an algorithm that will always successfully process the cards. Students iteratively develop, test, and share their algorithms with classmates. A wrap-up discussion has students reflect on the different types of problem-solving they used in these activities and the value of producing an algorithm to solve a problem.
            Apps and Storage:
              name: Apps and Storage
              description_student: 'This lesson covers the input and output aspects of computers in a context that is relevant and familiar to students: apps.

The class concludes with observations of these apps as well as a teacher led discussion about the impact of apps on society. '
              description_teacher: 'This lesson reviews the input, output, storage, and processing aspects of a computer in a context that is relevant and familiar to students: apps. In pairs, students evaluate smartphone applications to analyze the specific problems that they were designed to solve, the inputs that they need to work, and the processing that turns those inputs into the desired output, and what information they would want to store for later. The class concludes with a discussion that connects the lesson to apps students are more familiar with. '
            Project - Propose an App:
              name: Project - Propose an App
              description_student: To conclude the study of the problem solving process and the input/output/store/process model of a computer, the class proposes apps designed to solve real world problems.

              description_teacher: In this lesson students are introduced HTML as a solution to the problem of how to communicate both the content and structure of a website to a computer. The lesson begins with a brief unplugged activity demonstrating the challenges of effectively communicating the structure of a web page. Students then look at an exemplar HTML page in Web Lab and discuss with their classmates how HTML tags help solve this problem. Students then write their first HTML. A wrap-up discussion helps to solidify the understanding of content vs. structure that was developed throughout the lesson.
            Headings:
              name: Headings
              description_student: This lesson continues the introduction to HTML tags, this time with headers.  The class practices using header tags to create page and section titles and learns how the different header elements are displayed by default.  Next, the class plans how to organize their content on the personal web pages that will be built across the unit and begins the first page of the project.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students continue to use HTML to structure text on web pages, this time with headings.  Students learn how the different heading elements are displayed by default and practice using them to create page and section titles.  Students then start to decide how they will organize their content on their own personal web pages.  In the last level, students begin the project that they will continue to work on throughout the unit.
            Digital Footprint:
              name: Digital Footprint
              description_student: This lesson takes a step back from creating the personal website to talk about personal information people choose to share digitally.  The class begins by discussing what types of information are good to share with other people, then looks at several sample social media pages to see what types of personal information could be shared intentionally or unintentionally.  Finally, the class comes up with a set of guidelines to follow when putting information online.
              description_teacher: "As students have recently spent some time thinking about the actual content that will go into their personal website, this lesson takes a step back from the unit-long project (publication of a personal website) to help students articulate what personal information they choose to share digitally and with whom.  It also reinforces the notion that much of the information that they choose to share digitally falls largely out of their control the moment it is released.  \r\n\r\nStudents begin by individually identifying appropriate audiences with whom they would be comfortable sharing given pieces of personal information.  They then look at several social media pages to determine what sorts of information people are sharing about themselves or one another.  Last, students reflect on what guidelines they think are appropriate for posting information online.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate point of this lesson is not to scare students, but rather to experientially bring students to realizing precisely what level of control they don’t have in releasing information into the web."
            Lists:
              name: Lists
              description_student: This lesson introduces ordered and unordered lists and the associated  &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, and &lt;li&gt; HTML tags.  The class practices using the tags, then goes back to the personal web page project to add a new HTML page that includes the new tags.
              description_teacher: Students are introduced to ordered and unordered lists in HTML and work through a few levels in which they use the &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, and &lt;li&gt; tags.  They then go back to their project, where they add a new HTML page.  Inside the new page, they write the HTML to display a recipe, top ten list, or any other content that uses the new tags that they have learned.
            Intellectual Property and Images:
              name: Intellectual Property and Images
              description_student: This lesson covers how to use media such as images, video, or music created by others a website while respecting the rights of the creator of that media. After first studying Creative Commons licensing, the class learns how to add images to web pages, and how to give proper attribution when doing so.
              description_teacher: "Starting with a discussion of their personal opinions on how others should be allowed to use their work, the class explores the purpose and role of copyright for both creators and users of creative content.  They then move on to an activity exploring the various Creative Commons licenses as a solution to the difficulty in dealing with copyright. \n\nFinally, with a common understanding of the restrictions of various Creative Commons licenses, students learn how to add images to their web pages using the &lt;img&gt; tag."
            Clean Code and Debugging:
              name: Clean Code and Debugging
              description_student: In this lesson covers common issues that arise when designing web pages in HTML.

              description_teacher: This lesson encourages students to think more critically about how web searches work and how to find relevant and trustworthy information online. After viewing and discussion a video about how search engines work, students will search for information about several unlikely animals. They'll need to analyze the sites they find for reliability in order to identify which of the animals is actually a hoax.
            RGB Colors and Classes:
              name: RGB Colors and Classes
              description_student: This lesson covers classes and custom colors. The class first learns how to specify custom colors using RGB (red, green, blue) values, then applies these colors to a new Four Seasons web page, which uses CSS classes.  Using classes, the class adds more styles to the Four Seasons web page, then use them to style their personal websites.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students first learn how to specify custom colors using their RGB (red, green, blue) values.  They then apply these colors to a new Four Seasons web page, which uses CSS classes.  CSS classes allow web developers to treat groups of elements they want styled differently than other elements of the same type. Using classes, students add more styles to the Four Seasons web page, then use them to style their personal websites.

              name: Variables
              description_student: This lesson introduces variables as a way to label a number in a program or save a randomly generated value. The class begins the lesson with a very basic description of the purpose of a variable and practices using the new blocks.  Afterwards, the class uses variables to save a random number, allowing the programs to use the same random number multiple times.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students learn how to use variables to label a number in their program or save a randomly generated value. Students begin the lesson with a very basic description of the purpose of a variable. Students then complete a level progression that reinforces the model of a variable as a way to label or name a number. Students use variables to save a random number to see that variables actually store or save their values, allowing them to use the same random number multiple times in their programs.
            Sprites:
              name: Sprites
              description_student: In order to create more interesting and detailed images, the class is introduced to the sprite object. Every sprite can be assigned an image to show, and sprites also keep track of multiple values about themselves, which will prove useful down the road when making animations.

            The Draw Loop:
              name: The Draw Loop
              description_student: This lesson introduces the draw loop, one of the core programming paradigms in Game Lab.  The class combines the draw loop with random numbers to manipulate some simple animations with dots and then with sprites. Afterwards, everyone uses what they learned to update the sprite scene from the previous lesson.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students are introduced to the draw loop, one of the core programming paradigms in Game Lab. To begin the lesson students look at some physical flipbooks to see that having many frames with different images creates the impression of motion. Students then watch a video explaining how the draw loop in Game Lab helps to create this same impression in their programs. Students combine the draw loop with random numbers to manipulate some simple animations with dots and then with sprites. At the end of the lesson students use what they learned to update their sprite scene from the previous lesson.
            The Counter Pattern Unplugged:
              name: The Counter Pattern Unplugged
              description_student: This unplugged lesson explores the underlying behavior of variables.

              name: Booleans Unplugged
              description_student: This lesson introduces boolean values and logic, as well as conditional statements. The class starts by playing a simple game of Stand Up, Sit Down in which the boolean (true/false) statements describe personal properties (hair or eye color, clothing type, age, etc). The class then groups objects based on increasingly complex boolean statements, then looks at how conditionals can impact the flow of a program.
              description_teacher: |-
                In this lesson, students are introduced to boolean values and logic, as well as conditional statements. The class starts by playing a simple game of Stand Up, Sit Down in which the boolean (true/false) statements describe personal properties (hair or eye color, clothing type, age, etc). This gets students thinking about how they can frame a property with multiple potential values (such as age) with a binary question.

                From there students are provided a group of objects with similar, yet varying, physical properties. With a partner they group those objects based on increasingly complex boolean statements, including compound booleans with AND and OR.

                Finally we reveal Conditionals as a tool to make decisions or impact the flow of a program using boolean statements as input.
            Conditionals:
              name: Conditionals
              description_student: The class starts by using booleans to compare the current value of a sprite property with a target value, using that comparison to determine when a sprite has reached a point on the screen, grown to a given size, or otherwise reached a value using the counter pattern. After using booleans directly to investigate the values or sprite properties, the class adds conditional if statements to write code that responds to those boolean comparisons.

            Keyboard Input:
              name: Keyboard Input
              description_student: Following the introduction to booleans and if statements in the previous lesson, students are introduced to a new block called keyDown() which returns a boolean and can be used in conditionals statements to move sprites around the screen. By the end of this lesson students will have written programs that take keyboard input from the user to control sprites on the screen.
              description_teacher: Following the introduction to booleans and _if_ statements in the previous lesson, students are introduced to a new block called `keyDown()` which returns a boolean and can be used in conditionals statements to move sprites around the screen. By the end of this lesson students will have written programs that take keyboard input from the user to control sprites on the screen.
            Other Forms of Input:
              name: Other Forms of Input
              description_student: The class continues to explore ways to use conditional statements to take user input. In addition to the simple keyDown() command learned yesterday, the class learns about several other keyboard input commands as well as ways to take mouse input.

            Complex Sprite Movement:
              name: Complex Sprite Movement
              description_student: 'The class learns to combine the velocity properties of sprites with the counter pattern to create more complex sprite movement, such as simulating gravity, making a sprite jump, and allowing a sprite to float left or right. In the final levels the class combine these movements to animate and control a single sprite and build a simple game in which a character flies around and collects coins. '
              description_teacher: Students learn to combine the velocity properties of sprites with the counter pattern to create more complex sprite movement. In particular students will learn how to simulate gravity, make a sprite jump, and allow a sprite to float left or right. In the final levels of the Code Studio progression students combine these movements to animate and control a single sprite and build a simple game in which a character flies around and collects a coin. Students are encouraged to make their own additions to the game in the final level.
            Collisions:
              name: Collisions
              description_student: The class programs their sprites to interact in new ways.  After a brief review of how they used the isTouching block, the class brainstorms other ways that two sprites could interact.  They then use isTouching to make one sprite push another across the screen before practicing with the four collision blocks (collide, displace, bounce, and bounceOff).
              description_teacher: Students program their sprites to interact in new ways.  After a brief review of how they used the `isTouching` block, students brainstorm other ways that two sprites could interact.

            Functions:
              name: Functions
              description_student: This lesson covers functions as a way to organize their code, make it more readable, and remove repeated blocks of code. The class learns that higher level or more abstract steps make it easier to understand and reason about steps, then begins to create functions in Game Lab.  At the end of the lesson the class uses these skills to organize and add functionality to the final version of their side scroller game.
              description_teacher: Students learn how to create functions to organize their code, make it more readable, and remove repeated blocks of code. An unplugged warmup explores how directions at different levels of detail can be useful depending on context. Students learn that higher level or more abstract steps make it easier to understand and reason about steps. Afterwards students learn to create functions in Game Lab. They will use functions to remove long blocks of code from their draw loop and to replace repeated pieces of code with a single function. At the end of the lesson students use these skills to organize and add functionality to the final version of their side scroller game.

Next, they use a structured process to plan the backgrounds, variables, sprites, and functions they will need to implement their game.  After writing the code for the game, students will reflect on how the game could be improved, and implement those changes.
            Project - Design a Game:
              name: Project - Design a Game
              description_student: The class plans and builds original games using the project guide from the previous two lessons. Working individually or in pairs, the class plans, develops, and gives feedback on the games.  After incorporating the peer feedback, the class shares out the completed games.
              description_teacher: Students will plan and build their own game using the project guide from the previous two lessons to guide their project. Working individually or in pairs, students will first decide on the type of game they'd like to build, taking as inspiration a set of sample games. They will then complete a blank project guide where they will describe the game's behavior and scope out the variables, sprites, and functions they'll need to build. In Code Studio, a series of levels prompts them on a general sequence they can use to implement this plan. Partway through the process, students will share their projects for peer review and will incorporate feedback as they finish their game. At the end of the lesson, students will share their completed games with their classmates. This project will span multiple classes and can easily take anywhere from 3-5 class periods.

            Analysis of Design:
              name: Analysis of Design
              description_student: The class explores a variety of different teapot designs to consider how design choices or made and why. Using the teapots as an example, the class will explore the relationship between users, their needs, and the design of objects they use.
              description_teacher: To kick off a unit devoted to group problem solving and developing products for other users, students begin by investigating the design of various teapots. Students analyze each teapot, attempting to identify how specific user needs might have informed its design. By considering these design choices, and attempting to match each teapot with a potential user, students can begin to see how taking a user-centered approach to designing products (both physical and digital) can make those products more useful and usable. To conclude the activity, students are asked to propose some changes to one of the teapots that would make it more useful or usable.
            Understanding Your User:
              name: Understanding Your User
              description_student: Using user profiles, the class explores how different users might react to a variety of products. Role playing as a different person, each member of the class will get to experience designs through someone else's eyes.
              description_teacher: "Designers need to understand their users’ needs in order to create useful products.  This lesson encourages students to think about how to design for another person by role-playing as someone else using a user profile and reacting as that user to a series of products.  Each student is assigned a user profile describing a person, which they then use to choose appropriate products, critique product design, and suggest improvements to design.\r\n"
            User-Centered Design Micro Activity:
              name: User-Centered Design Micro Activity
              description_student: In small groups, the class uses the design process to come up with ideas for smart clothing. From brainstorming, to identifying users, to finally proposing a design, this is the first of several opportunities in this unit to practicing designing a solution for the needs of others.
              description_teacher: This lesson guides students through an abbreviated version of the design process they will be seeing throughout this unit. Students first brainstorm a list of potential users of smart clothing. As a class, they then group these ideas into broad categories and each group will choose one category of user. Groups repeat this process to brainstorm needs or concerns of their user, eventually categorizing these needs and choosing one to focus on. Finally, students design a piece of smart clothing, using the specific needs and concerns they brainstormed to guide their decision making. At the end of the class students quickly share their decision-making process and get feedback on how well their product addresses the user need they selected.
            User Interfaces:
              name: User Interfaces
              description_student: See how a paper prototype can be used to test and get feedback on software before writing any code. To help out a developer with their idea, the class tests and provides an app prototype made of paper.
              description_teacher: Following the mini design project, students look towards the next phase of design - prototyping a product that attempts to address user needs. In teams, students examine a paper prototype for a chat app called "Txt Ur Grndkdz". Through using this paper prototype, students get a chance to see how a simple paper prototype can be used to quickly test ideas and assumptions before we ever get to the computer. After "using" the provided prototype students begin to identify ways to improve the next iteration.
            Feedback and Testing:
              name: Feedback and Testing
              description_student: Users have been testing an app, and they have lots of feedback for the developer. The class needs to sort through all of this feedback, identify the common themes and needs, and start revising the prototype to make it better meet the users' needs.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students use feedback from "users" of the paper-prototyped app from the previous lesson in order to develop improvements to the user interface of that paper prototype. The lesson begins with a reflection on the fact that designers need to translate human needs with technology into changes to the user interface or experience. Students are then given a collection of feedback and requests from users of the app from the previous lesson. In groups students categorize the feedback and identify ways the needs expressed in the feedback could be met by changes to the interface of the app. Then in groups students will implement some of these changes to meet one of the needs they identified.
            Identifying User Needs:
              name: Identifying User Needs
              description_student: Up to this point the users that the class has considered have all been remote, and the only information from users has come through text or role playing. Now the class will rely on each other as potential users, and pairs will get to interview each other to identify needs that could be addressed by developing an app.
              description_teacher: 'Up to this point students have focused on designing for users who are, to some degree, distanced from them. Whether through brainstorming, profiles, or text feedback, the connection to an end user has never been direct. This is distance is designed to help students get outside their own head when thinking about users, but in order to get information more directly from an actual user, students need to rely on their classmates. In this lesson students pair up to become users (and designers) for each other, allowing everyone to directly interview their end user and ask questions to better inform their design. Each student pair interviews each other, attempting to identify a specific need that could be addressed by an app. '
            Project - Paper Prototype:
              name: Project - Paper Prototype
              description_student: Using the interview information from the previous lesson, the class comes up with app ideas to address the needs of their users. To express those ideas, and test out their effectiveness, each student creates and tests paper prototypes of their own.
              description_teacher: Based on the peer interview from the previous lesson, each student comes up with an idea for an app that will address their user's problem. Students then get to create their own paper prototype of their app ideas by drawing "screens" on individual notecards. A project guide directs students through the process including building the app and testing it with their user to see if their assumptions about the user interfaces they created are accurate.
            Designing Apps for Good:
              name: Designing Apps for Good
              description_student: To kick off the app design project, the class organizes into teams and starts exploring app topics. Several example socially impactful apps serve as inspiration for the project.
              description_teacher: To kick off the app design project that lasts through the end of the unit, students first explore a number of apps designed for social impact that have been created by other students. The class then reviews the Define, Prepare, Try, and Reflect steps of the Problem Solving process as they develop an idea for an app of their own with social impact. Finally, students will form project teams and lay out a contract for how the team will function throughout the development of their app.
            Market Research:
              name: Market Research
              description_student: Dive into app development by exploring existing apps that may serve similar users. Each group identifies a handful of apps that address the same topic they are working on, using those apps to help refine the app idea they will pursue.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students research apps similar to the one they intend on creating to better understand the needs of their users. Students work within their teams to search the Internet for other apps, then evaluate the ones they find interesting. By the end of the lesson, each team will have a clearer idea about the type of app they want to create and further refine who their target users are. Each team will maintain a list of citations for all the apps they examined for use in their final presentation.
            Paper Prototypes:
              name: Paper Prototypes
              description_student: Paper prototypes allow developers to quickly test ideas before investing a lot of time writing code. In this lesson teams explore some example apps created in App Lab, using those apps to help inform the first paper prototypes of their apps.
              description_teacher: "Before starting to design apps, we need to help students to better scope their expectations. Because students will eventually be prototyping these apps in App Lab, they will be in better shape if their ideas align with the kinds of apps that are easily prototyped in App Lab. Teams start this scoping by looking through several example apps designed to demonstrate apps that can be created with App Lab. Teams then can chose one (or more) of the apps as a basis for their own. From there, teams have some time to discuss the basic functionality of their app before using 3x5 index cards to develop paper prototypes.\r\n"
            Prototype Testing:
              name: Prototype Testing
              description_student: In this lesson teams test out their paper prototypes with other members of the class. With one student role playing the computer, one narrating, and the rest observing, teams will get immediate feedback on their app designs which will inform the next version of their app prototypes.
              description_teacher: The primary purpose of developing paper prototypes is that they allow for quick testing and iteration before any code is written. This lesson is focused on giving teams a chance to test their prototypes before moving to App Lab. Teams develop a plan to test with users before running prototype tests with multiple other students in the class (and potentially outside the class). In order to test the prototype with the users, the students will have to assign roles in the testing (the “narrator”, the “computer” and the “observers”) as well as have some questions prepared for the user to answer after the test is complete.
            Digital Design:
              name: Digital Design
              description_student: Having developed, tested, and gathered feedback on a paper prototype, teams now move to App Lab to build the next iteration of their apps. Using the drag-and-drop Design Mode, each team member builds out at least one page of their team's app, responding to feedback that was received in the previous round of testing.
              description_teacher: Having collaboratively developed a paper prototype for their apps, groups now divide and conquer to begin work on an interactive digital version based on the paper prototype. Using the drag-and-drop design mode of App Lab, students individually work through a progression of skill-building levels to learn how to build digital versions of a paper prototype. From there, each group member builds out at least one page of their app in App Lab, to be later combined into a single app.
            Linking Screens:
              name: Linking Screens
              description_student: Building on the screens that the class designed in the previous lesson, teams combine screens into a single app. Simple code can then be added to make button clicks change to the appropriate screen.
              description_teacher: In this lesson teams combine the screens that they designed in the previous lesson into a single app, which they can then link together using code. Students learn basic event driven programming by building up the model app that they started in the previous lesson. In addition to the screen that students designed yesterday, they'll learn how to create additional screens and even import screens made by others.
            Testing the App:
              name: Testing the App
              description_student: Teams run another round of user testing, this time with their interactive prototype. Feedback gathered from this round of testing will inform the final iteration of the app prototypes.
              description_teacher: 'By the end of the previous lesson each team should have a minimum viable prototype of their app. The primary purpose of this lesson is to have the team actually test the app with other people, preferably from the target audience the app is intended for, or from different teams in the class while observers from the team will record the results on the worksheets they used in the planning phase. As with testing the paper prototypes, teams will start by planning for the specific scenarios before running and observing tests. '
            Improving and Iterating:
              name: Improving and Iterating
              description_student: Using the feedback from the last round of testing, teams implement changes that address the needs of their users. Each team tracks and prioritizes the features they want to add and the bugs they need to fix.
              description_teacher: Teams have at this point developed an app prototype that has gone through multiple iterations and rounds of user testing. With the information and guidance gained from the last round of user testing, each student has the opportunity to plan for and implement improvements to the team app. Depending on the time you have available, and student interest, you can run the cycle of testing and iteration as many times as you see fit.
            Project - App Presentation:
              name: Project - App Presentation
              description_student: Each team prepares a presentation to "pitch" the app they've developed. This is the time to share struggles, triumphs, and plans for the future.
              description_teacher: At this point teams have researched a topic of personal and social importance, developed and tested both a paper prototype and a digital prototype, and iterated on the initial app to incorporate new features and bug fixes. Now is the time for them to review what they have done and pull together a coherent presentation to demonstrate their process of creation. Using the provided presentation template, teams prepare to present about their process of app development, including the problem they set out to solve, the ways in which they've incorporated feedback from testing, and their plans for the future.

              description_student: This first lesson provides an overview of what data is and how it is used to solve problems.  Groups use a data set to make a series of meal recommendations for people with various criteria.   Afterwards, groups compare their responses and discuss how the different representations of the meal data affected how the students were able to solve the different problems.
              description_teacher: In the first lesson of the data unit, students get an overview of what data is and how it is used to solve problems.  Students start off with a brief discussion to come to a common understanding of data.  They then split into groups and use a data set to make a series of meal recommendations for people with various criteria.  Each group has the choices of meal represented in a different way (pictures, recipes, menu, nutrition) that gives an advantage for one of the recommendations.  Afterwards, groups compare their responses and discuss how the different representations of the meal data affected how the students were able to solve the different problems.
            Patterns and Representation:
              name: Patterns and Representation
              description_student: This lesson looks closer at what is needed to create a system of representation.  Groups create systems that can represent any letter in the alphabet using only a single stack of cards, then create messages with their systems and exchange with other groups to ensure the system worked as intended.   The class discusses commonalities between working systems while recognizing that there are many possible working solutions.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students create their own system for representing information. They begin by brainstorming all the different systems they already use to represent yes-no responses. They then work in small groups to create a system that can represent any letter in the alphabet using only a single stack of cards. The cards used have one of 6 different possible drawings (6 animals, 6 colors, etc.) and so to represent the entire alphabet students will need to use patterns of multiple cards to represent each letter. Students create messages with their systems and exchange with other groups to ensure the system worked as intended. In the wrap-up discussion the class  reviews any pros and cons of the different systems. They discuss commonalities between working systems and recognize that there are many possible solutions to this problem and what's important is that everyone use the same arbitrary system to communicate.
            ASCII and Binary Representation:
              name: ASCII and Binary Representation
              description_student: This lesson introduces a formal binary system for encoding information, the ASCII system for representing letters and other characters. At the beginning of the lesson the teacher introduces the fact that computers must represent information using either "on" or "off". The class is then introduced to the ASCII system for representing text using binary symbols and practices using this system before encoding their own messages using ASCII.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students learn to use their first binary system for encoding information, the ASCII system for representing letters and other characters. At the beginning of the lesson the teacher introduces the fact that computers must represent information using either "on" or "off". Then students are introduced to the ASCII system for representing text using binary symbols. Students practice using this system before encoding their own message using ASCII. At the end of the lesson a debrief conversation helps synthesize the key learning objectives of the activity.
            Representing Images:
              name: Representing Images
              description_student: This lesson continues the study of binary representation systems, this time with images. The class is introduced to the concept of splitting images into squares or "pixels" which can then be turned on or off individually to make the entire image. After doing a short set of challenges using the Pixelation Widget, the class makes connections between the system for representing images and the system for representing text they learned in the previous lesson.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students learn how computers represent images. To begin the lesson they consider the challenge of turning all the complexity of vision into a binary pattern. Through a series of images showing how this transformation is made students are introduced to the concept of splitting images into squares or "pixels" which can then be turned on or off individually to make the entire image. Students then do a short set of challenges using the Pixelation Widget in order to draw black and white images. Puzzles are designed to call out some of the challenges of representing images in this way. In the wrap up students make connections between the system for representing images and the system for representing text they learned in the previous lesson.
            Representing Numbers:
              name: Representing Numbers
              description_student: This lesson introduces the binary number system.  With a set of cards that represent the place values in a binary (base-2) number system, the class turns bits "on" or "off" by turning cards face up and face down, then observes the numbers that result from these different patterns.  Eventually, the pattern is extended to a generic 4-bit system.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students learn about the binary number system.  With a set of cards that represent the place values in a binary (base-2) number system by a collection of dots, students turn bits "on" or "off" by turning cards face up and face down, then observe the numbers that result from these different patterns.  Eventually, students extend the pattern to a generic 4-bit system.
            Keeping Data Secret:
              name: Keeping Data Secret
              description_student: Students have a discussion on the different levels of security they would like for personal data.  Once the class has developed an understanding of the importance of privacy, they learn about the process of encrypting information by enciphering a note for a partner and deciphering the partner's note.  The class concludes with a discussion about the importance of both physical and digital security.
              description_teacher: Students have a discussion on the different levels of security they would like for personal data.

            Combining Representations:
              name: Combining Representations
              description_student: This lesson combines all three types of binary representation systems (ASCII characters, binary number, and images) to allow for the encode of more complex types information in a record.  After seeing a series of bits and being asked to decode them, the class is introduced to the idea that  understanding binary information requires understanding both the system that is being used and the meaning of the information encoded.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students use all three types of binary representation systems (ASCII characters, binary number, and images) to decode information in a record.  After seeing a series of bits and being asked to decode them, students are introduced to the idea that in order to understand binary information, they must understand both the system that is being used and the meaning of the information encoded.  They then decode a record representing a pet based on a given structure.
            Project - Create a Representation:
              name: Project - Create a Representation
              description_student: The class designs structure to represent their perfect day using the binary representation systems they've learned in this chapter. After deciding which pieces of information the record should capture, the class will decide how a punch card of bytes of information will be interpreted to represent those pieces of information. Afterwards, everyone will use the ASCII, binary number, and image formats they have learned to represent their perfect days try to decipher what a partner's perfect day is like.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students design a structure to represent their perfect day using the binary representation systems they've learned in this chapter. Students will first write a short description of their perfect day and then review with a partner to identify the key pieces of information they think a computer could capture. As a class students will decide how a punch card of bytes of information will be interpreted to represent those pieces of information. Students will then use the ASCII, binary number, and image formats they have learned to represent their perfect days. Students then trade punch cards and try to decipher what the other student's perfect day is like. The lesson ends with a reflection.
            Problem Solving and Data:
              name: Problem Solving and Data
              description_student: This lesson covers how the problem solving process can be tailored to deal with data problems, in particular.  The class is tasked with deciding what a city most needs to spend resources on.  They must find and use data from the Internet to support their decision.
              description_teacher: 'In this lesson, students use the problem solving process from earlier in the course to solve a data problem.  After reviewing the process, the class is presented with a decision: whether a city should build a library, pet shelter, or fire department.  Students work in teams to collect information on the Internet to help them decide what should be built, then use this information build an argument that will convince the city council of their choice.  They then map what they have done to the problem solving process that they have been using throughout the course, comparing the general problem solving process to its specific application to data problems.'
            Problem Solving with Big Data:
              name: Problem Solving with Big Data
              description_student: This lesson covers how data is collected and used by a organizations to solve problems in the real world. The class looks at three scenarios that could be solved using data and brainstorms the types of data they would want to solve them and how they could collect the data.  Each scenario also includes a video about a real-world service that has solved a similar problem with data.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students look at how data is collected and used by organizations to solve problems in the real world. The lesson begins with a quick review of the data problem solving process they  explored in the last lesson. Then students are presented three scenarios that could be solved using data and brainstorm the types of data they would want to solve them and how they could collect the data. Each problem is designed to reflect a real-world service that exists. After brainstorming, students watch a video about a real-world service and record notes about what data is collected by the real-world service and how it is used. At the end of the lesson, students record whether data was provided actively by a user, was recorded passively, or is collected by sensors.
            Structuring Data:
              name: Structuring Data
              description_student: This lesson goes further into the interpretation of data, including cleaning and visualizing raw data sets.  The class first looks at the how presenting data in different ways can help people to understand it better.  After seeing how cleaning and visualization can help people make better decisions, the class looks at what parts of this process can be automated, and what need a human.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students go further into the collection and interpretation of data, including cleaning and visualizing data.  Students first look at the how presenting data in different ways can help people to understand it better, and they then create visualizations of their own data. Using a the results of a preferred pizza topping survey, students must decide what to do with data that does not easily fit into the visualization scheme that they have chosen.  Finally, students look at which parts of this process can be automated by a computer and which need a human to make decisions.
            Making Decisions with Data:
              name: Making Decisions with Data
              description_student: This lesson gives the class a chance to practice the data problem solving process introduced in the last lesson.  Not all questions have right answers and in some cases the class can and should decide that they should collect more data. The lesson concludes with a discussion of how different people could draw different conclusions from the same data, or how collecting different data might have affected the decisions they made.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students get practice making decisions with data based on some problems designed to be familiar to middle school students. Students work in groups discussing how they would use the data presented to make a decision before the class discusses their final choices. Not all questions have right answers and in some cases students can and should decide that they should collect more data. The lesson concludes with a discussion of how different people could draw different conclusions from the same data, or how collecting different data might have affected the decisions they made.
            Interpreting Data:
              name: Interpreting Data
              description_student: Students begin the lesson by looking at a cake preference survey that allows respondents to specify both a cake and an icing flavor.  They discuss how knowing the relationship between cake and icing preference helps them better decide which combination to recommend.  They are then introduced to cross tabulation, which allows them to graph relationships to different preferences.  They use this technique to find relationships in a preference survey, then brainstorm the different types of problems that this process could help solve.

              name: Automating Data Decisions
              description_student: In this lesson students look at a simple example of how a computer could be used to complete the decision making step of the data problem solving process. Students are given the task of creating an algorithm that could suggest a vacation spot.  Students then create rules, or an algorithm, that a computer could use to make this decision automatically. Students share their rules and what choices their rules would make with the class data. They then use their rules on data from their classmates to test whether their rules would make the same decision that  a person would. The lesson concludes with a discussion about the benefits and drawbacks of using computers to automate the data problem solving process.

            Project - Solve a Data Problem:
              name: Project - Solve a Data Problem
              description_student: To conclude this unit the class designs ways to use data to make a recommendations or predictions to help solve a problem.  In the first several steps the class brainstorms problems, performs simple research, and defines a problem of their choosing. They then decide what kind of data they want to collect, how it could be collected, and how it could be used, before exchanging feedback and giving a final presentation.
              description_teacher: To conclude this unit, students design a recommendation engine based on data that they collect and analyze from their classmates. After looking at an example of a recommendation app, students follow a project guide to complete this multi-day activity. In the first several steps, students choose what choice they want to help the user to make, what data they need to give the recommendation, create a survey, and collect information about their classmates' choices. They then interpret the data and use what they have learned to create the recommendation algorithm.  Last, they use their algorithms to make recommendations to a few classmates. Students perform a peer review and make any necessary updates to their projects before preparing a presentation to the class.

Through an ongoing project  - the “class data tracker” - students learn how to collect and clean data, and to use a few common tools for computing aggregations and creating visualizations. \r\n\r\nThe second chapter explores the importance of data within apps. App Lab has a number of tools that allow you to collect and use data in your apps. The second chapter provides an overview of how these tools work, a sampling of example projects that can be built using these tools, and a space in which to build and submit a final project."

          student_description: "In the first chapter of this unit students develop skills interpreting visual data and using spreadsheet and visualization tools to create their own digital artifacts.  Through an ongoing project  - the “class data tracker” - students learn how to collect and clean data, and to use a few common tools for computing aggregations and creating visualizations. \r\n\r\nThe second chapter explores the importance of data within apps. App Lab has a number of tools that allow you to collect and use data in your apps. The second chapter provides an overview of how these tools work, a sampling of example projects that can be built using these tools, and a space in which to build and submit a final project."

You’ll practice using a problem solving process to address a series of puzzles, challenges, and real world scenarios. Next, you’ll learn how computers input, output, store, and process information to help humans solve problems.  The unit concludes with a project in which you design an application that helps solve a problem of your choosing.\r\n"

At the end of the lesson groups reflect on their experiences with the activity and make connections to the types of problem solving they will be doing for the rest of the course. '
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students work in groups to design aluminum foil boats that will support as many pennies as possible. Groups have two rounds to work on their boats, with the goal of trying to hold more pennies than they did in round 1. The structure of the activity foreshadows different steps of the problem solving process that students will be introduced to in more detail in the following lesson. At the end of the lesson students reflect on their experiences with the activity and make connections to the types of problem solving they will be doing for the rest of the course.
            The Problem Solving Process:
              name: The Problem Solving Process
              description_student: This lesson introduces the formal problem solving process that the class will use over the course of the year, Define - Prepare - Try - Reflect.  The class relates these steps to the aluminum boats problem from the previous lesson, then a problem they are good at solving, then a problem they want to improve at solving. At the end of the lesson the class collects a list of generally useful strategies for each step of the process to put on posters that will be used throughout the unit and year.
              description_teacher: This lesson introduces the formal problem solving process that students will use over the course of the year, Define - Prepare - Try - Reflect. The lesson begins by asking students to brainstorm all the different types of problems that they encounter in everyday life. Students are then shown the four steps of the problem solving process and work together to relate these abstract steps to their actual experiences solving problems. First students relate these steps to the aluminum boats problem from the previous lesson, then a problem they are good at solving, then a problem they want to improve at solving. At the end of the lesson the class collects a list of generally useful strategies for each step of the process to put on posters that will be used throughout the unit and year.
            Exploring Problem Solving:
              name: Exploring Problem Solving
              description_student: 'In this lesson the class applies the problem solving process to three different problems: a word search, a seating arrangement for a birthday party, and planning a trip. The problems grow increasingly complex and poorly defined to highlight how the problem solving process is particularly helpful when tackling these types of problems.'
              description_teacher: "In this lesson students apply the problem solving process to three different problems in order to better understand the value of each step. They will solve a word search, arrange seating for a birthday party, and plan a trip. The problems grow increasingly complex and poorly defined to highlight how the problem solving process is particularly helpful when tackling these types of problems. The lesson concludes with students reflecting on their experience with the problem solving process. They will justify the inclusion of each step and will brainstorm questions or strategies that can help them better define open-ended problems, as this is often the most critical step.\r\n\r\nThis lesson will likely take two class periods or more to complete. The first two problems may fit into a single class period but the third will need to be moved to a second day."
            What is a Computer?:
              name: What is a Computer?
              description_student: In this lesson the class develops a preliminary definition of a computer. After brainstorming the possible definitions for a computer, the class works in groups to sort pictures into “is a computer” or “is not a computer” on poster paper and explain their motivations for choosing some of the most difficult categorizations.  The teacher then introduces a definition of the computer and allows groups to revise their posters according to the new definition.
              description_teacher: "In this lesson students develop a preliminary definition of a computer. To begin the lesson, the class will brainstorm possible definitions for a computer and place the results of this brainstorm on the board. Next, students will work in groups to sort pictures into “is a computer” or “is not a computer” on poster paper. Groups will place their posters around the room and briefly explain their motivations for choosing some of their most difficult categorizations.  The teacher will then introduce a definition of the computer and allow students to revise their posters according to the new definition.\r\n"
            Input and Output:
              name: Input and Output
              description_student: In this the class students consider a number of computing devices to determine what types of inputs and outputs they use. Groups are assigned to a computing device and based on a teacher-provided definition of input and output, list the inputs and outputs of their device.  To conclude the lesson the class examines common activities they do on a computing device and select the inputs and outputs used for that activity from the chart.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students consider a number of computing devices to determine what types of inputs and outputs they use. Groups are assigned to a computing device and based on a teacher-provided definition of input and output, list the inputs and outputs of their device. Earlier in the activity students are prompted to focus on more obvious physical inputs and outputs (e.g. a keyboard as an input or a screen as an output) but later discussions lead students to consider less obvious examples (e.g. that a touch screen is both an input and output, or the fact that the Internet can serve as both input and output). Throughout the lesson the teacher records inputs and outputs that are identified on a T-Chart at the front of the room. To conclude the lesson students examine common activities they do on a computing device and select the inputs and outputs used for that activity from the chart.
            Processing:
              name: Processing
              description_student: This lesson dives deeper into the concept of processing that was introduced as part of the definition of a computer.  Pairs work together to put a deck of cards in order, a form of processing information.  In the end, the class discusses what processing means within the context of solving information problems.
              description_teacher: Students complete two unplugged card sorting activities to explore the meaning of processing and its relationship to problem-solving. The first activity has few constraints and is used to introduce a high-level definition of processing. The next introduces more constraints that force students to develop an algorithm that will always successfully process the cards. Students iteratively develop, test, and share their algorithms with classmates. A wrap-up discussion has students reflect on the different types of problem-solving they used in these activities and the value of producing an algorithm to solve a problem.

            Digital Footprint:
              name: Digital Footprint
              description_student: This lesson takes a step back from creating the personal website to talk about personal information people choose to share digitally.  The class begins by discussing what types of information are good to share with other people, then looks at several sample social media pages to see what types of personal information could be shared intentionally or unintentionally.  Finally, the class comes up with a set of guidelines to follow when putting information online.
              description_teacher: "As students have recently spent some time thinking about the actual content that will go into their personal website, this lesson takes a step back from the unit-long project (publication of a personal website) to help students articulate what personal information they choose to share digitally and with whom.  It also reinforces the notion that much of the information that they choose to share digitally falls largely out of their control the moment it is released.  \r\n\r\nStudents begin by individually identifying appropriate audiences with whom they would be comfortable sharing given pieces of personal information.  They then look at several social media pages to determine what sorts of information people are sharing about themselves or one another.  Last, students reflect on what guidelines they think are appropriate for posting information online.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate point of this lesson is not to scare students, but rather to experientially bring students to realizing precisely what level of control they don’t have in releasing information into the web."
            Lists:
              name: Lists
              description_student: This lesson introduces ordered and unordered lists and the associated  &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, and &lt;li&gt; HTML tags.  The class practices using the tags, then goes back to the personal web page project to add a new HTML page that includes the new tags.
              description_teacher: Students are introduced to ordered and unordered lists in HTML and work through a few levels in which they use the &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, and &lt;li&gt; tags.

                In this lesson, students are introduced to boolean values and logic, as well as conditional statements. The class starts by playing a simple game of Stand Up, Sit Down in which the boolean (true/false) statements describe personal properties (hair or eye color, clothing type, age, etc). This gets students thinking about how they can frame a property with multiple potential values (such as age) with a binary question.

                From there students are provided a group of objects with similar, yet varying, physical properties. With a partner they group those objects based on increasingly complex boolean statements, including compound booleans with AND and OR.

                Finally we reveal Conditionals as a tool to make decisions or impact the flow of a program using boolean statements as input.

              description_student: The class starts by using booleans to compare the current value of a sprite property with a target value, using that comparison to determine when a sprite has reached a point on the screen, grown to a given size, or otherwise reached a value using the counter pattern. After using booleans directly to investigate the values or sprite properties, the class adds conditional if statements to write code that responds to those boolean comparisons.
              description_teacher: Students start by using booleans to compare the current value of a sprite property with a target value, using that comparison to determine when a sprite has reached a point on the screen, grown to a given size, or otherwise reached a value using the counter pattern. After using booleans directly to investigate the values or sprite properties, students add conditional _if_ statements to write code that responds to those boolean comparisons.
            Keyboard Input:
              name: Keyboard Input
              description_student: Following the introduction to booleans and if statements in the previous lesson, students are introduced to a new block called keyDown() which returns a boolean and can be used in conditionals statements to move sprites around the screen. By the end of this lesson students will have written programs that take keyboard input from the user to control sprites on the screen.
              description_teacher: Following the introduction to booleans and _if_ statements in the previous lesson, students are introduced to a new block called `keyDown()` which returns a boolean and can be used in conditionals statements to move sprites around the screen. By the end of this lesson students will have written programs that take keyboard input from the user to control sprites on the screen.
            Other Forms of Input:
              name: Other Forms of Input
              description_student: The class continues to explore ways to use conditional statements to take user input. In addition to the simple keyDown() command learned yesterday, the class learns about several other keyboard input commands as well as ways to take mouse input.

            Collision Detection:
              name: Collision Detection
              description_student: The class learns about collision detection on the computer.  Pairs explore how a computer could use sprite location and size properties and math to detect whether two sprites are touching.  The class then uses the isTouching() block to create different effects when sprites collide, including playing sounds.  Last, they use their new skills to improve the sidescroller game that they started in the last lesson.

            Complex Sprite Movement:
              name: Complex Sprite Movement
              description_student: 'The class learns to combine the velocity properties of sprites with the counter pattern to create more complex sprite movement, such as simulating gravity, making a sprite jump, and allowing a sprite to float left or right. In the final levels the class combine these movements to animate and control a single sprite and build a simple game in which a character flies around and collects coins. '
              description_teacher: Students learn to combine the velocity properties of sprites with the counter pattern to create more complex sprite movement. In particular students will learn how to simulate gravity, make a sprite jump, and allow a sprite to float left or right. In the final levels of the Code Studio progression students combine these movements to animate and control a single sprite and build a simple game in which a character flies around and collects a coin. Students are encouraged to make their own additions to the game in the final level.
            Collisions:
              name: Collisions
              description_student: The class programs their sprites to interact in new ways.  After a brief review of how they used the isTouching block, the class brainstorms other ways that two sprites could interact.  They then use isTouching to make one sprite push another across the screen before practicing with the four collision blocks (collide, displace, bounce, and bounceOff).
              description_teacher: Students program their sprites to interact in new ways.  After a brief review of how they used the `isTouching` block, students brainstorm other ways that two sprites could interact.  They then use `isTouching` to make one sprite push another across the screen before practicing with the four collision blocks (`collide`, `displace`, `bounce`, and `bounceOff`).
            Functions:
              name: Functions
              description_student: This lesson covers functions as a way to organize their code, make it more readable, and remove repeated blocks of code. The class learns that higher level or more abstract steps make it easier to understand and reason about steps, then begins to create functions in Game Lab.  At the end of the lesson the class uses these skills to organize and add functionality to the final version of their side scroller game.
              description_teacher: Students learn how to create functions to organize their code, make it more readable, and remove repeated blocks of code. An unplugged warmup explores how directions at different levels of detail can be useful depending on context. Students learn that higher level or more abstract steps make it easier to understand and reason about steps. Afterwards students learn to create functions in Game Lab. They will use functions to remove long blocks of code from their draw loop and to replace repeated pieces of code with a single function. At the end of the lesson students use these skills to organize and add functionality to the final version of their side scroller game.
            The Game Design Process:
              name: The Game Design Process
              description_student: This lesson introduces the process the class will use to design games for the remainder of the unit. The class walks through through this process in a series of levels. As part of this lesson the class also briefly learn to use multi-frame animations in Game Lab. At the end of the lesson they have an opportunity to make improvements to the game to make it their own.
              description_teacher: This lesson introduces students to the process they will use to design games for the remainder of the unit. This process is centered around a project guide which asks students to define their sprites, variables, and functions before they begin programming their game. In this lesson students begin by playing a game on Game Lab where the code is hidden. They discuss what they think the sprites, variables, and functions would need to be to make the game. They are then given a completed project guide which shows one way to implement the game. Students are then walked through this process through a series of levels. As part of this lesson students also briefly learn to use multi-frame animations in Game Lab. At the end of the lesson students have an opportunity to make improvements to the game to make it their own.
            Using the Game Design Process:
              name: Using the Game Design Process
              description_student: In this multi-day lesson, the class uses the problem solving process from Unit 1 to create a platform jumper game.  After looking at a sample game, the class defines what their games will look like and uses a structured process to build them.  Finally, the class reflects on how the games could be improved, and implements those changes.
              description_teacher: In this multi-day lesson, students use the problem solving process from Unit 1 to create a platform jumper game.  They start by looking at an example of a platform jumper, then define what their games will look like.  Next, they use a structured process to plan the backgrounds, variables, sprites, and functions they will need to implement their game.  After writing the code for the game, students will reflect on how the game could be improved, and implement those changes.
            Project - Design a Game:
              name: Project - Design a Game
              description_student: The class plans and builds original games using the project guide from the previous two lessons. Working individually or in pairs, the class plans, develops, and gives feedback on the games.  After incorporating the peer feedback, the class shares out the completed games.
              description_teacher: Students will plan and build their own game using the project guide from the previous two lessons to guide their project. Working individually or in pairs, students will first decide on the type of game they'd like to build, taking as inspiration a set of sample games. They will then complete a blank project guide where they will describe the game's behavior and scope out the variables, sprites, and functions they'll need to build. In Code Studio, a series of levels prompts them on a general sequence they can use to implement this plan. Partway through the process, students will share their projects for peer review and will incorporate feedback as they finish their game. At the end of the lesson, students will share their completed games with their classmates. This project will span multiple classes and can easily take anywhere from 3-5 class periods.

Through a series of design challenges, you will learn how to better understand the needs of others while developing a solution to a problem. The second half of the unit consists of an iterative team project, during which teams have the opportunity to identify a need that they care about, prototype solutions both on paper and in App Lab, and test solutions with real users to get feedback and drive further iteration.

            Analysis of Design:
              name: Analysis of Design
              description_student: The class explores a variety of different teapot designs to consider how design choices or made and why. Using the teapots as an example, the class will explore the relationship between users, their needs, and the design of objects they use.
              description_teacher: To kick off a unit devoted to group problem solving and developing products for other users, students begin by investigating the design of various teapots. Students analyze each teapot, attempting to identify how specific user needs might have informed its design. By considering these design choices, and attempting to match each teapot with a potential user, students can begin to see how taking a user-centered approach to designing products (both physical and digital) can make those products more useful and usable. To conclude the activity, students are asked to propose some changes to one of the teapots that would make it more useful or usable.
            Understanding Your User:
              name: Understanding Your User
              description_student: Using user profiles, the class explores how different users might react to a variety of products. Role playing as a different person, each member of the class will get to experience designs through someone else's eyes.
              description_teacher: "Designers need to understand their users’ needs in order to create useful products.  This lesson encourages students to think about how to design for another person by role-playing as someone else using a user profile and reacting as that user to a series of products.  Each student is assigned a user profile describing a person, which they then use to choose appropriate products, critique product design, and suggest improvements to design.\r\n"
            User-Centered Design Micro Activity:
              name: User-Centered Design Micro Activity
              description_student: In small groups, the class uses the design process to come up with ideas for smart clothing. From brainstorming, to identifying users, to finally proposing a design, this is the first of several opportunities in this unit to practicing designing a solution for the needs of others.
              description_teacher: This lesson guides students through an abbreviated version of the design process they will be seeing throughout this unit. Students first brainstorm a list of potential users of smart clothing. As a class, they then group these ideas into broad categories and each group will choose one category of user. Groups repeat this process to brainstorm needs or concerns of their user, eventually categorizing these needs and choosing one to focus on. Finally, students design a piece of smart clothing, using the specific needs and concerns they brainstormed to guide their decision making. At the end of the class students quickly share their decision-making process and get feedback on how well their product addresses the user need they selected.
            User Interfaces:
              name: User Interfaces
              description_student: See how a paper prototype can be used to test and get feedback on software before writing any code. To help out a developer with their idea, the class tests and provides an app prototype made of paper.
              description_teacher: Following the mini design project, students look towards the next phase of design - prototyping a product that attempts to address user needs. In teams, students examine a paper prototype for a chat app called "Txt Ur Grndkdz". Through using this paper prototype, students get a chance to see how a simple paper prototype can be used to quickly test ideas and assumptions before we ever get to the computer. After "using" the provided prototype students begin to identify ways to improve the next iteration.
            Feedback and Testing:
              name: Feedback and Testing
              description_student: Users have been testing an app, and they have lots of feedback for the developer. The class needs to sort through all of this feedback, identify the common themes and needs, and start revising the prototype to make it better meet the users' needs.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students use feedback from "users" of the paper-prototyped app from the previous lesson in order to develop improvements to the user interface of that paper prototype. The lesson begins with a reflection on the fact that designers need to translate human needs with technology into changes to the user interface or experience. Students are then given a collection of feedback and requests from users of the app from the previous lesson. In groups students categorize the feedback and identify ways the needs expressed in the feedback could be met by changes to the interface of the app. Then in groups students will implement some of these changes to meet one of the needs they identified.
            Identifying User Needs:
              name: Identifying User Needs
              description_student: Up to this point the users that the class has considered have all been remote, and the only information from users has come through text or role playing. Now the class will rely on each other as potential users, and pairs will get to interview each other to identify needs that could be addressed by developing an app.
              description_teacher: 'Up to this point students have focused on designing for users who are, to some degree, distanced from them. Whether through brainstorming, profiles, or text feedback, the connection to an end user has never been direct. This is distance is designed to help students get outside their own head when thinking about users, but in order to get information more directly from an actual user, students need to rely on their classmates. In this lesson students pair up to become users (and designers) for each other, allowing everyone to directly interview their end user and ask questions to better inform their design. Each student pair interviews each other, attempting to identify a specific need that could be addressed by an app. '
            Project - Paper Prototype:
              name: Project - Paper Prototype
              description_student: Using the interview information from the previous lesson, the class comes up with app ideas to address the needs of their users. To express those ideas, and test out their effectiveness, each student creates and tests paper prototypes of their own.
              description_teacher: Based on the peer interview from the previous lesson, each student comes up with an idea for an app that will address their user's problem. Students then get to create their own paper prototype of their app ideas by drawing "screens" on individual notecards. A project guide directs students through the process including building the app and testing it with their user to see if their assumptions about the user interfaces they created are accurate.
            Designing Apps for Good:
              name: Designing Apps for Good
              description_student: To kick off the app design project, the class organizes into teams and starts exploring app topics. Several example socially impactful apps serve as inspiration for the project.
              description_teacher: To kick off the app design project that lasts through the end of the unit, students first explore a number of apps designed for social impact that have been created by other students. The class then reviews the Define, Prepare, Try, and Reflect steps of the Problem Solving process as they develop an idea for an app of their own with social impact. Finally, students will form project teams and lay out a contract for how the team will function throughout the development of their app.
            Market Research:
              name: Market Research
              description_student: Dive into app development by exploring existing apps that may serve similar users. Each group identifies a handful of apps that address the same topic they are working on, using those apps to help refine the app idea they will pursue.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students research apps similar to the one they intend on creating to better understand the needs of their users. Students work within their teams to search the Internet for other apps, then evaluate the ones they find interesting. By the end of the lesson, each team will have a clearer idea about the type of app they want to create and further refine who their target users are. Each team will maintain a list of citations for all the apps they examined for use in their final presentation.
            Paper Prototypes:
              name: Paper Prototypes
              description_student: Paper prototypes allow developers to quickly test ideas before investing a lot of time writing code. In this lesson teams explore some example apps created in App Lab, using those apps to help inform the first paper prototypes of their apps.
              description_teacher: "Before starting to design apps, we need to help students to better scope their expectations. Because students will eventually be prototyping these apps in App Lab, they will be in better shape if their ideas align with the kinds of apps that are easily prototyped in App Lab. Teams start this scoping by looking through several example apps designed to demonstrate apps that can be created with App Lab. Teams then can chose one (or more) of the apps as a basis for their own. From there, teams have some time to discuss the basic functionality of their app before using 3x5 index cards to develop paper prototypes.\r\n"
            Prototype Testing:
              name: Prototype Testing
              description_student: In this lesson teams test out their paper prototypes with other members of the class. With one student role playing the computer, one narrating, and the rest observing, teams will get immediate feedback on their app designs which will inform the next version of their app prototypes.
              description_teacher: The primary purpose of developing paper prototypes is that they allow for quick testing and iteration before any code is written. This lesson is focused on giving teams a chance to test their prototypes before moving to App Lab. Teams develop a plan to test with users before running prototype tests with multiple other students in the class (and potentially outside the class). In order to test the prototype with the users, the students will have to assign roles in the testing (the “narrator”, the “computer” and the “observers”) as well as have some questions prepared for the user to answer after the test is complete.
            Digital Design:
              name: Digital Design
              description_student: Having developed, tested, and gathered feedback on a paper prototype, teams now move to App Lab to build the next iteration of their apps. Using the drag-and-drop Design Mode, each team member builds out at least one page of their team's app, responding to feedback that was received in the previous round of testing.
              description_teacher: Having collaboratively developed a paper prototype for their apps, groups now divide and conquer to begin work on an interactive digital version based on the paper prototype. Using the drag-and-drop design mode of App Lab, students individually work through a progression of skill-building levels to learn how to build digital versions of a paper prototype. From there, each group member builds out at least one page of their app in App Lab, to be later combined into a single app.
            Linking Screens:
              name: Linking Screens
              description_student: Building on the screens that the class designed in the previous lesson, teams combine screens into a single app. Simple code can then be added to make button clicks change to the appropriate screen.
              description_teacher: In this lesson teams combine the screens that they designed in the previous lesson into a single app, which they can then link together using code. Students learn basic event driven programming by building up the model app that they started in the previous lesson. In addition to the screen that students designed yesterday, they'll learn how to create additional screens and even import screens made by others.
            Testing the App:
              name: Testing the App
              description_student: Teams run another round of user testing, this time with their interactive prototype. Feedback gathered from this round of testing will inform the final iteration of the app prototypes.
              description_teacher: 'By the end of the previous lesson each team should have a minimum viable prototype of their app. The primary purpose of this lesson is to have the team actually test the app with other people, preferably from the target audience the app is intended for, or from different teams in the class while observers from the team will record the results on the worksheets they used in the planning phase. As with testing the paper prototypes, teams will start by planning for the specific scenarios before running and observing tests. '
            Improving and Iterating:
              name: Improving and Iterating
              description_student: Using the feedback from the last round of testing, teams implement changes that address the needs of their users. Each team tracks and prioritizes the features they want to add and the bugs they need to fix.
              description_teacher: Teams have at this point developed an app prototype that has gone through multiple iterations and rounds of user testing. With the information and guidance gained from the last round of user testing, each student has the opportunity to plan for and implement improvements to the team app. Depending on the time you have available, and student interest, you can run the cycle of testing and iteration as many times as you see fit.
            Project - App Presentation:
              name: Project - App Presentation
              description_student: Each team prepares a presentation to "pitch" the app they've developed. This is the time to share struggles, triumphs, and plans for the future.
              description_teacher: At this point teams have researched a topic of personal and social importance, developed and tested both a paper prototype and a digital prototype, and iterated on the initial app to incorporate new features and bug fixes. Now is the time for them to review what they have done and pull together a coherent presentation to demonstrate their process of creation. Using the provided presentation template, teams prepare to present about their process of app development, including the problem they set out to solve, the ways in which they've incorporated feedback from testing, and their plans for the future.

            Representation Matters:
              name: Representation Matters
              description_student: This first lesson provides an overview of what data is and how it is used to solve problems.  Groups use a data set to make a series of meal recommendations for people with various criteria.   Afterwards, groups compare their responses and discuss how the different representations of the meal data affected how the students were able to solve the different problems.
              description_teacher: In the first lesson of the data unit, students get an overview of what data is and how it is used to solve problems.  Students start off with a brief discussion to come to a common understanding of data.  They then split into groups and use a data set to make a series of meal recommendations for people with various criteria.  Each group has the choices of meal represented in a different way (pictures, recipes, menu, nutrition) that gives an advantage for one of the recommendations.  Afterwards, groups compare their responses and discuss how the different representations of the meal data affected how the students were able to solve the different problems.
            Patterns and Representation:
              name: Patterns and Representation
              description_student: This lesson looks closer at what is needed to create a system of representation.  Groups create systems that can represent any letter in the alphabet using only a single stack of cards, then create messages with their systems and exchange with other groups to ensure the system worked as intended.   The class discusses commonalities between working systems while recognizing that there are many possible working solutions.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students create their own system for representing information. They begin by brainstorming all the different systems they already use to represent yes-no responses. They then work in small groups to create a system that can represent any letter in the alphabet using only a single stack of cards. The cards used have one of 6 different possible drawings (6 animals, 6 colors, etc.) and so to represent the entire alphabet students will need to use patterns of multiple cards to represent each letter. Students create messages with their systems and exchange with other groups to ensure the system worked as intended. In the wrap-up discussion the class  reviews any pros and cons of the different systems. They discuss commonalities between working systems and recognize that there are many possible solutions to this problem and what's important is that everyone use the same arbitrary system to communicate.
            ASCII and Binary Representation:
              name: ASCII and Binary Representation
              description_student: This lesson introduces a formal binary system for encoding information, the ASCII system for representing letters and other characters. At the beginning of the lesson the teacher introduces the fact that computers must represent information using either "on" or "off". The class is then introduced to the ASCII system for representing text using binary symbols and practices using this system before encoding their own messages using ASCII.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students learn to use their first binary system for encoding information, the ASCII system for representing letters and other characters. At the beginning of the lesson the teacher introduces the fact that computers must represent information using either "on" or "off". Then students are introduced to the ASCII system for representing text using binary symbols. Students practice using this system before encoding their own message using ASCII. At the end of the lesson a debrief conversation helps synthesize the key learning objectives of the activity.
            Representing Images:
              name: Representing Images
              description_student: This lesson continues the study of binary representation systems, this time with images. The class is introduced to the concept of splitting images into squares or "pixels" which can then be turned on or off individually to make the entire image. After doing a short set of challenges using the Pixelation Widget, the class makes connections between the system for representing images and the system for representing text they learned in the previous lesson.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students learn how computers represent images. To begin the lesson they consider the challenge of turning all the complexity of vision into a binary pattern. Through a series of images showing how this transformation is made students are introduced to the concept of splitting images into squares or "pixels" which can then be turned on or off individually to make the entire image. Students then do a short set of challenges using the Pixelation Widget in order to draw black and white images. Puzzles are designed to call out some of the challenges of representing images in this way. In the wrap up students make connections between the system for representing images and the system for representing text they learned in the previous lesson.
            Representing Numbers:
              name: Representing Numbers
              description_student: This lesson introduces the binary number system.  With a set of cards that represent the place values in a binary (base-2) number system, the class turns bits "on" or "off" by turning cards face up and face down, then observes the numbers that result from these different patterns.  Eventually, the pattern is extended to a generic 4-bit system.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students learn about the binary number system.  With a set of cards that represent the place values in a binary (base-2) number system by a collection of dots, students turn bits "on" or "off" by turning cards face up and face down, then observe the numbers that result from these different patterns.  Eventually, students extend the pattern to a generic 4-bit system.
            Keeping Data Secret:
              name: Keeping Data Secret
              description_student: Students have a discussion on the different levels of security they would like for personal data.  Once the class has developed an understanding of the importance of privacy, they learn about the process of encrypting information by enciphering a note for a partner and deciphering the partner's note.  The class concludes with a discussion about the importance of both physical and digital security.

            Combining Representations:
              name: Combining Representations
              description_student: This lesson combines all three types of binary representation systems (ASCII characters, binary number, and images) to allow for the encode of more complex types information in a record.  After seeing a series of bits and being asked to decode them, the class is introduced to the idea that  understanding binary information requires understanding both the system that is being used and the meaning of the information encoded.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students use all three types of binary representation systems (ASCII characters, binary number, and images) to decode information in a record.  After seeing a series of bits and being asked to decode them, students are introduced to the idea that in order to understand binary information, they must understand both the system that is being used and the meaning of the information encoded.  They then decode a record representing a pet based on a given structure.
            Project - Create a Representation:
              name: Project - Create a Representation
              description_student: The class designs structure to represent their perfect day using the binary representation systems they've learned in this chapter. After deciding which pieces of information the record should capture, the class will decide how a punch card of bytes of information will be interpreted to represent those pieces of information. Afterwards, everyone will use the ASCII, binary number, and image formats they have learned to represent their perfect days try to decipher what a partner's perfect day is like.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students design a structure to represent their perfect day using the binary representation systems they've learned in this chapter. Students will first write a short description of their perfect day and then review with a partner to identify the key pieces of information they think a computer could capture. As a class students will decide how a punch card of bytes of information will be interpreted to represent those pieces of information. Students will then use the ASCII, binary number, and image formats they have learned to represent their perfect days. Students then trade punch cards and try to decipher what the other student's perfect day is like. The lesson ends with a reflection.
            Problem Solving and Data:
              name: Problem Solving and Data
              description_student: This lesson covers how the problem solving process can be tailored to deal with data problems, in particular.  The class is tasked with deciding what a city most needs to spend resources on.  They must find and use data from the Internet to support their decision.
              description_teacher: 'In this lesson, students use the problem solving process from earlier in the course to solve a data problem.  After reviewing the process, the class is presented with a decision: whether a city should build a library, pet shelter, or fire department.  Students work in teams to collect information on the Internet to help them decide what should be built, then use this information build an argument that will convince the city council of their choice.  They then map what they have done to the problem solving process that they have been using throughout the course, comparing the general problem solving process to its specific application to data problems.'
            Problem Solving with Big Data:
              name: Problem Solving with Big Data
              description_student: This lesson covers how data is collected and used by a organizations to solve problems in the real world. The class looks at three scenarios that could be solved using data and brainstorms the types of data they would want to solve them and how they could collect the data.  Each scenario also includes a video about a real-world service that has solved a similar problem with data.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students look at how data is collected and used by organizations to solve problems in the real world. The lesson begins with a quick review of the data problem solving process they  explored in the last lesson. Then students are presented three scenarios that could be solved using data and brainstorm the types of data they would want to solve them and how they could collect the data. Each problem is designed to reflect a real-world service that exists. After brainstorming, students watch a video about a real-world service and record notes about what data is collected by the real-world service and how it is used. At the end of the lesson, students record whether data was provided actively by a user, was recorded passively, or is collected by sensors.
            Structuring Data:
              name: Structuring Data
              description_student: This lesson goes further into the interpretation of data, including cleaning and visualizing raw data sets.  The class first looks at the how presenting data in different ways can help people to understand it better.  After seeing how cleaning and visualization can help people make better decisions, the class looks at what parts of this process can be automated, and what need a human.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students go further into the collection and interpretation of data, including cleaning and visualizing data.  Students first look at the how presenting data in different ways can help people to understand it better, and they then create visualizations of their own data. Using a the results of a preferred pizza topping survey, students must decide what to do with data that does not easily fit into the visualization scheme that they have chosen.  Finally, students look at which parts of this process can be automated by a computer and which need a human to make decisions.
            Making Decisions with Data:
              name: Making Decisions with Data
              description_student: This lesson gives the class a chance to practice the data problem solving process introduced in the last lesson.  Not all questions have right answers and in some cases the class can and should decide that they should collect more data. The lesson concludes with a discussion of how different people could draw different conclusions from the same data, or how collecting different data might have affected the decisions they made.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students get practice making decisions with data based on some problems designed to be familiar to middle school students. Students work in groups discussing how they would use the data presented to make a decision before the class discusses their final choices. Not all questions have right answers and in some cases students can and should decide that they should collect more data. The lesson concludes with a discussion of how different people could draw different conclusions from the same data, or how collecting different data might have affected the decisions they made.
            Interpreting Data:
              name: Interpreting Data
              description_student: Students begin the lesson by looking at a cake preference survey that allows respondents to specify both a cake and an icing flavor.  They discuss how knowing the relationship between cake and icing preference helps them better decide which combination to recommend.  They are then introduced to cross tabulation, which allows them to graph relationships to different preferences.  They use this technique to find relationships in a preference survey, then brainstorm the different types of problems that this process could help solve.

            Automating Data Decisions:
              name: Automating Data Decisions
              description_student: In this lesson students look at a simple example of how a computer could be used to complete the decision making step of the data problem solving process. Students are given the task of creating an algorithm that could suggest a vacation spot.  Students then create rules, or an algorithm, that a computer could use to make this decision automatically. Students share their rules and what choices their rules would make with the class data. They then use their rules on data from their classmates to test whether their rules would make the same decision that  a person would. The lesson concludes with a discussion about the benefits and drawbacks of using computers to automate the data problem solving process.

            Project - Solve a Data Problem:
              name: Project - Solve a Data Problem
              description_student: To conclude this unit the class designs ways to use data to make a recommendations or predictions to help solve a problem.  In the first several steps the class brainstorms problems, performs simple research, and defines a problem of their choosing. They then decide what kind of data they want to collect, how it could be collected, and how it could be used, before exchanging feedback and giving a final presentation.
              description_teacher: To conclude this unit, students design a recommendation engine based on data that they collect and analyze from their classmates. After looking at an example of a recommendation app, students follow a project guide to complete this multi-day activity. In the first several steps, students choose what choice they want to help the user to make, what data they need to give the recommendation, create a survey, and collect information about their classmates' choices. They then interpret the data and use what they have learned to create the recommendation algorithm.  Last, they use their algorithms to make recommendations to a few classmates. Students perform a peer review and make any necessary updates to their projects before preparing a presentation to the class.

This gets students thinking about how they can frame a property with multiple potential values (such as age) with a binary question.

                From there students are provided a group of objects with similar, yet varying, physical properties. With a partner they group those objects based on increasingly complex boolean statements, including compound booleans with AND and OR.

              name: Nested Loops in Maze
              description_student: Loops inside loops inside loops. What does this mean? This lesson will teach you what happens when you create a nested loop.
              description_teacher: In this online activity, students will have the opportunity to push their understanding of loops to a whole new level. Playing with the Bee and Plants vs Zombies, students will learn how to program a loop to be inside of another loop. They will also be encouraged to figure out how little changes in either loop will affect their program when they click `Run`.
            Conditionals with Cards:
              name: Conditionals with Cards
              description_student: It's time to play a game where you earn points only under certain conditions!
              description_teacher: "This lesson demonstrates how conditionals can be used to tailor a program to specific information. We don’t always have all of the information we need when writing a program. Sometimes you will want to do something different in one situation than in another, even if you don't know what situation will be true when your code runs. That is where conditionals come in. Conditionals allow a computer to make a decision, based on the information that is true any time your code is run.\r\n\r\n"
            Conditionals in Bee:
              name: If/Else with Bee
              description_student: 'Now that you understand conditionals, it''s time to program Bee to use them when collecting honey and nectar. '
              description_teacher: Up until this point students have been writing code that executes exactly the same way each time it is run - reliable, but not very flexible. In this lesson, your class will begin to code with conditionals, allowing them to write code that functions differently depending on the specific conditions the program encounters.
            While Loops in Farmer:
              name: While Loops in Farmer
              description_student: 'Loops are so useful in coding. This lesson will teach you about a new kind of loop: while loops!'
              description_teacher: "By the time students reach this lesson, they should already have plenty of practice using `repeat` loops, so now it's time to mix things up. \r\n\r\n_While loops_ are loops that continue to repeat commands while a condition is met. `While` loops are used when the programmer doesn't know the exact number of times commands need to be repeated, but does know what condition needs to be true in order for the loop to continue repeating. For example, students will be working to fill holes and dig dirt in Farmer. They will not know the size of the holes or the height of the mountains of dirt, but the students will know they need to keep filling the holes and digging the dirt as long as the ground is not flat."
            Until Loops in Maze:
              name: Until Loops in Maze
              description_student: You can do some amazing things when you use `until` loops!

              description_student: It's not always clear when to use each conditional.  This lesson will help you get practice deciding what to do.
              description_teacher: Students will practice `while` loops, `until` loops, and `if / else` statements. All of these blocks use conditionals. By practicing all three, students will learn to write complex and flexible code.
            'Unplugged: Binary':
              name: Binary Images
              description_student: Learn how computers store pictures using a language with only two options.
              description_teacher: Though many people think of binary as strictly zeros and ones, students will be introduced to the idea that information can be represented in a variety of binary options. This lesson takes that concept one step further as it illustrates how a computer can store even more complex information (such as images and colors) in binary, as well.
            Artist Binary:
              name: Binary Images with Artist
              description_student: In this lesson, you will learn how to make images using only 0s and 1s.

              description_student: This lesson introduces to HTML as a solution to the problem of how to communicate both the content and structure of a website to a computer. The lesson begins with a brief unplugged activity demonstrating the challenges of effectively communicating the structure of a web page. The class looks at an HTML page in Web Lab and discusses how HTML tags help solve this problem, then uses HTML to write the first web pages of the unit.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students are introduced HTML as a solution to the problem of how to communicate both the content and structure of a website to a computer. The lesson begins with a brief unplugged activity demonstrating the challenges of effectively communicating the structure of a web page. Students then look at an exemplar HTML page in Web Lab and discuss with their classmates how HTML tags help solve this problem. Students then write their first HTML. A wrap-up discussion helps to solidify the understanding of content vs. structure that was developed throughout the lesson.
            Headings:
              name: Headings
              description_student: This lesson continues the introduction to HTML tags, this time with headers.  The class practices using header tags to create page and section titles and learns how the different header elements are displayed by default.  Next, the class plans how to organize their content on the personal web pages that will be built across the unit and begins the first page of the project.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students continue to use HTML to structure text on web pages, this time with headings.  Students learn how the different heading elements are displayed by default and practice using them to create page and section titles.  Students then start to decide how they will organize their content on their own personal web pages.  In the last level, students begin the project that they will continue to work on throughout the unit.
            Digital Footprint:
              name: Digital Footprint
              description_student: This lesson takes a step back from creating the personal website to talk about personal information people choose to share digitally.  The class begins by discussing what types of information are good to share with other people, then looks at several sample social media pages to see what types of personal information could be shared intentionally or unintentionally.  Finally, the class comes up with a set of guidelines to follow when putting information online.
              description_teacher: "As students have recently spent some time thinking about the actual content that will go into their personal website, this lesson takes a step back from the unit-long project (publication of a personal website) to help students articulate what personal information they choose to share digitally and with whom.  It also reinforces the notion that much of the information that they choose to share digitally falls largely out of their control the moment it is released.  \r\n\r\nStudents begin by individually identifying appropriate audiences with whom they would be comfortable sharing given pieces of personal information.  They then look at several social media pages to determine what sorts of information people are sharing about themselves or one another.  Last, students reflect on what guidelines they think are appropriate for posting information online.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate point of this lesson is not to scare students, but rather to experientially bring students to realizing precisely what level of control they don’t have in releasing information into the web."

Finally everyone brainstorms and shares a list of topics and interests to include, creating a resource for developing a personal website in the rest of the unit. '
              description_teacher: In this lesson students investigate ways to use websites as a means of personal expression and develop a list of topics and interests that they would want to include on a personal website. To begin the lesson students brainstorm different ways that people express and share their interests and ideas. Students then look at a few exemplar websites made by students from a previous CS Discoveries course to identify ways they are expressing their ideas.

                This lesson introduces the final component of the unit's model of computing: storage.  After trying out an "outfit picker" app, students discuss what information should be stored in the app versus input every time the app is run.  They then look at a series of apps and use their decisions about what should be stored to create guidelines for deciding what information to store.  They then review the four components of this chapter's model of computing: input, output, storage, and processing.  Afterwards, they have one last opportunity to revise their decisions about which items should be classified as a "computer" from earlier in the chapter.  The lesson ends with a reflection on their own app ideas and how storage could be used.

                Based on user interview from the previous lesson, each student comes up with an idea for an app that will address their user's problem. Students then get to create their own paper prototype of their app ideas by drawing "screens" on individual notecards. A project guide directs students through the process including building the paper prototype and testing it with their user to see if their assumptions about the user interfaces they created are accurate.

                This is a two-day lesson, with specific timings outlined in the lesson plan below
            Designing Apps for Good:

              description_student: "**Question of the Day: What is an App for Good we want to create?**\n\nIn this lesson, you will begin the process of designing an app that will last through the end of this unit and starts with making a plan for how your team will function together while creating this app, a topic for your app and potential users. "
              description_teacher: "**Question of the Day: What is an App for Good we want to create?**\n \nThis lesson starts an app design project that lasts through the end of the unit. Students first explore a number of apps designed for social impact that have been created by other students. Students form project teams and lay out a contract for how the team will function throughout the development of their app. Finally, they brainstorm a team name, a topic for their app, and potential users.\n"

              name: Market Research
              description_student: "**Question of the Day: How can we use existing apps as inspiration for our own apps?**\n\nIn this lesson, you will dive into app development by exploring existing apps that may serve similar users as the app you are working on. "
              description_teacher: |-
                **Question of the Day: How can we use existing apps as inspiration for our own apps?**

                In this lesson students research apps similar to the one they intend on creating to better understand the needs of their users. Students work within their teams to search the Internet for other apps, then evaluate the ones they find interesting. By the end of the lesson, each team will have a clearer idea about the type of app they want to create and further refine who their target users are. Each team will maintain a list of citations for all the apps they examined for use in their final presentation.
            Paper Prototypes:
              key: Paper Prototypes
              name: Build a Paper Prototype
              description_student: "**Question of the Day: How can we build a paper prototype for our app?**\n\nIn this lesson, you will work with your team to create a paper prototype for your app. \n"

                **Question of the Day: How can we build a paper prototype for our app?**

                Students work in their teams to create paper prototypes for the apps they’ve been developing. They begin by making a plan for each screen, then assigning different team members to work on each screen so the task can be completed in time. They can use 3x5 index cards to develop their paper prototypes, or the Paper Prototype template.
            Prototype Testing:
              key: Prototype Testing
              name: Prototype Testing
              description_student: "**Question of the Day: How does our prototype work when tested by real users?**\n\nIn this lesson, you will work with your team to test your paper prototype with other members of the class. "
              description_teacher: |-
                **Question of the Day: How does our prototype work when tested by real users?**

                The primary purpose of developing paper prototypes is that they allow for quick testing and iteration before any code is written. This lesson is focused on giving teams a chance to test their prototypes before moving to App Lab. Teams develop a plan to test with users before running prototype tests with multiple other students in the class (and potentially outside the class). In order to test the prototype with the users, the students will have to assign roles in the testing (the “narrator”, the “computer” and the “observers”) as well as have some questions prepared for the user to answer after the test is complete.
            Digital Design:
              key: Digital Design
              name: Design Mode in App Lab
              description_student: "**Question of the Day: How can we use App Lab and Design Mode to create apps?**\n\nIn this lesson, you will work with your team to start building the next iteration of your app in App Lab. "
              description_teacher: "**Question of the Day: How can we use App Lab and Design Mode to create apps?**\n \nStudents are introduced to the App Lab programming environment that they will use to build their apps. Students work through a progression of skill-building levels to learn how to use the drag-and-drop design mode of App Lab. They end the lesson by making a plan to adapt one of their Paper Prototype screens into App Lab, focusing on having unique IDs for each element.\n"
            Linking Screens:
              key: Linking Screens
              name: Linking Prototype Screens
              description_student: "**Question of the Day: How can I combine screens to create a complete digital prototype?**\n\nIn this lesson, you will import each teammate's screen into your own app and work independently to add events to your code to link the screens together. "
              description_teacher: "**Question of the Day: How can I combine screens to create a complete digital prototype?**\n \nIn this lesson, teams combine their digital prototype screens into a single app, which they can then link together using code. They share their project’s import URLs with each other, then import each teammate’s screen into their own app. Each student works independently to add events to their code to link the screens together, completing their digital prototype.\n"
            Testing the App:
              key: Testing the App
              name: Testing the App
              description_student: "**Question of the Day: How does our digital prototype work when tested by real users?**\n\nIn this lesson, you will run another round of user testing with your digital prototype and gather feedback that will be used to inform the final iteration of your app. "
              description_teacher: "**Question of the Day: How does our digital prototype work when tested by real users?**\n \nBy the end of the previous lesson, each team should have a working prototype of their app. The primary purpose of this lesson is to have the team actually test the app with other people, preferably from the target audience the app is intended for, or from different teams in the class while observers from the team will record the results. As with testing the paper prototypes, teams will start by planning for the specific scenarios before running and observing tests.\n"

              description_student: "**Question of the Day: How can I present the steps in our design process to people outside of our team?**\n\nIn this lesson, you will work with your team to prepare a presentation to \"pitch\" the app you've developed. "
              description_teacher: "**Question of the Day: How can I present the steps in our design process to people outside of our team?**\n \nAt this point, teams have researched a topic of personal and social importance, developed and tested both a paper prototype and a digital prototype, and iterated on the initial app to incorporate new features and bug fixes. Now is the time for them to review what they have done and pull together a coherent presentation to demonstrate their process of creation. Using the provided presentation template, teams prepare to present about their process of app development, including the problem they set out to solve, the ways in which they've incorporated feedback from testing, and their plans for the future.\n"

This lesson focuses on the Define and Prepare steps of the process. Students first brainstorm a list of potential users of smart clothing. As a class, they then group these ideas into broad categories and each group will choose one category of user. Groups repeat this process to brainstorm needs or concerns of their user, eventually categorizing these needs and choosing one to focus on. In the next lesson, students will complete the Try and Reflect steps of the design process.\r\n"

              name: Exploring UI Elements
              description_student: "**Question of the Day: What user interface elements will be useful for our app?**\n\nIn this lesson, you will explore some example apps created in App Lab and use these examples to help inform your first paper prototype of your app. "
              description_teacher: |-
                **Question of the Day: What user interface elements will be useful for our app?**

                Before starting to design apps, we need to help students scope their expectations. Because students will eventually be prototyping these apps in App Lab, they will be in better shape if their ideas align with the kinds of apps that can be made using AppLab’s tools. Today focuses on having teams look at several example apps made in AppLab and identifying the components of the user interface. They then make a plan for which features could use which components in their app.
            Build a Digital Prototype:
              name: Build a Digital Prototype
              description_student: "**Question of the Day: How can I design a digital prototype from a paper prototype?**\n\nIn this lesson, you will work with your team to build the next iteration of your app with each team member building out at least one page of your app. "
              description_teacher: |-
                **Question of the Day: How can I design a digital prototype from a paper prototype?**

                Having collaboratively developed a paper prototype for their apps, groups now divide and conquer to begin work on an interactive digital version based on the paper prototype. Using the drag-and-drop design mode of App Lab, students individually work through a progression of skill-building levels to learn how to build digital versions of a paper prototype. From there, each group member builds out at least one page of their app in App Lab, to be later combined into a single app.
            Events In AppLab:
              name: Events in AppLab
              description_student: "**Question of the Day: How can I use events to create an app?**\n\nIn this lesson, you will combine the screens each team member built into a single app and learn how to program events so that you can navigate between your screens. "
              description_teacher: "**Question of the Day: How can I use events to create an app?**\n \nIn this lesson, students learn how to add screens to their apps, how to import screens created by other students, and how to program events to navigate between screens. Students learn basic event-driven programming by building up the model app that they started in the previous lesson. At the end of the lesson, students make a plan for how they will stay organized when importing each other’s screens in tomorrow’s lesson.\n"
            Bugs and Features:
              name: Bugs and Features
              description_student: "**Question of the Day: How can we create a plan to address bugs and features in our prototype?**\n\nIn this lesson, you will use feedback from the previous lesson to address the needs of users as well as any bugs that you need to fix. "
              description_teacher: "**Question of the Day: How can we create a plan to address bugs and features in our prototype?**\n \nTeams have at this point developed an app prototype that has gone through multiple iterations and rounds of user testing. With the information and guidance gained from the last round of user testing, each student has the opportunity to plan for and implement improvements to the team app. Depending on the time you have available, and student interest, you can run the cycle of testing and iteration as many times as you see fit.\n"

              description_student: "**Question of the Day: How can I track my work while we make updates to our app?**\n\nIn this lesson, you will work with your team to implement changes that address the needs of your users. "
              description_teacher: "**Question of the Day: How can I track my work while we make updates to our app?**\n \nTeams make a decision about how they will incorporate updates to their app, then they begin updating their app based on their post-its from yesterday’s lesson. They use a “To Do / Doing / Done” chart to organize their work and track their progress. Teams spend the majority of the class working on updating their app, with time at the end to re-combine into a single app if necessary.\n"

                **Question of the Day: How does data affect decisions we make every day?**

                In the first lesson of the data unit, students get an overview of what data is and how it is used to solve problems. Students start off with a brief discussion to come to a common understanding of data. They then split into groups and use a data set to make a series of meal recommendations for people with various criteria. Each group has the choices of meal represented in a different way (pictures, recipes, menu, nutrition) that gives an advantage for one of the recommendations. Afterwards, groups compare their responses and discuss how the different representations of the meal data affected how the students were able to solve the different problems.

"
              description_teacher: "**Question of the Day: How can we create a system for representing information?**\r\n\r\nIn this lesson students create their own system for representing information. They begin by brainstorming all the different systems they already use to represent yes-no responses. They then work in small groups to create a system that can represent any letter in the alphabet using only a single stack of cards. The cards used have one of 6 different possible drawings (6 animals, 6 colors, etc.) and so to represent the entire alphabet students will need to use patterns of multiple cards to represent each letter. Students create messages with their systems and exchange with other groups to ensure the system worked as intended. In the wrap-up discussion the class reviews any pros and cons of the different systems. They discuss commonalities between working systems and recognize that there are many possible solutions to this problem and what's important is that everyone uses the same arbitrary system to communicate.\r\n"

              description_teacher: "**Question of the Day: What system do computers use to represent letters and words?**\r\n \r\nIn this lesson students learn to use their first binary system for encoding information, the ASCII system for representing letters and other characters. At the beginning of the lesson the teacher introduces the fact that computers must represent information using either \"on\" or \"off\". Then students are introduced to the ASCII system for representing text using binary symbols. Students practice using this system before encoding their own message using ASCII. At the end of the lesson a debrief conversation helps synthesize the key learning objectives of the activity."

              description_teacher: "**Question of the Day: What system do computers use to represent images?**\r\n\r\nIn this lesson students learn how computers represent images. To begin the lesson they consider the challenge of turning all the complexity of vision into a binary pattern. Through a series of images showing how this transformation is made students are introduced to the concept of splitting images into squares or \"pixels\" which can then be turned on or off individually to make the entire image. Students then do a short set of challenges using the Pixelation Widget in order to draw black and white images. Puzzles are designed to call out some of the challenges of representing images in this way. In the wrap up students make connections between the system for representing images and the system for representing text they learned in the previous lesson.\r\n"

With a set of cards that represent the place values in a binary (base-2) number system by a collection of dots, students turn bits \"on\" or \"off\" by turning cards face up and face down, then observe the numbers that result from these different patterns.  Eventually, students extend the pattern to a generic 4-bit system."

                **Question of the Day: How can we keep data secret and protect it from misuse?**

                Students continue to explore how data is represented in a punchcard, and begin considering whether some data should be protected from public view because it is too personal or sensitive. Once students understand the reasons for protecting data, they learn a binary encryption system that lets them encrypt and decrypt data in their punchcards, and eventually they are able to send secret messages to one another using this method. Class concludes with a discussion on the importance of protecting our information and how encryption is one way we can accomplish this.

                In this lesson students design a structure to represent their perfect day using the binary representation systems they've learned in this chapter. Students will first write a short description of their perfect day and then review with a partner to identify the key pieces of information they think a computer could capture. As a class students will decide how a punch card of bytes of information will be interpreted to represent those pieces of information. Students will then use the ASCII, binary number, and image formats they have learned to represent their perfect days. Students then trade punch cards and try to decode what the other student's perfect day is like. The lesson ends with a reflection.

              description_teacher: "**Question of the Day: How can we use data to solve problems in our community?**\r\n\r\nIn this lesson, students use the problem solving process from earlier in the course to solve a data problem. After reviewing the process, the class is presented with a decision: whether a city should build a library, pet shelter, or fire department. Students work in teams to collect information on the Internet to help them decide what should be built, then use this information to build an argument that will convince the city council of their choice. They then map what they have done to the problem solving process that they have been using throughout the course, comparing the general problem solving process to its specific application to data problems."

Students are presented with three scenarios that could be solved using data and brainstorm the types of data they would need and how they could collect the data. Each problem is designed to reflect a real-world service that exists. After brainstorming, students watch a video about a real-world service and record notes about what data is collected by the real-world service and how it is used. At the end of the lesson, students record whether data was provided actively by a user, was recorded passively, or is collected by sensors.\r\n"

Students work in groups discussing how they would use the data presented to make a decision before the class discusses their final choices. Not all questions have right answers and in some cases students can and should decide that they should collect more data. The lesson concludes with a discussion of how different people could draw different conclusions from the same data, or how collecting different data might have affected the decisions they made.\r\n"

They discuss how knowing the relationship between cake and icing preference helps them better decide which combination to recommend. They are then introduced to cross tabulation, which allows them to graph relationships to different preferences. They use this technique to find relationships in a preference survey, then brainstorm the different types of problems that this process could help solve.

                To conclude this unit, students design a recommendation engine based on data that they collect and analyze from their classmates. After looking at an example of a recommendation app, students follow a project guide to complete this multi-day activity. In the first several steps, students choose what choice they want to help the user to make, what data they need to give the recommendation, create a survey, and collect information about their classmates' choices. They then interpret the data and use what they have learned to create the recommendation algorithm. Last, they use their algorithms to make recommendations to a few classmates. Students perform a peer review and make any necessary updates to their projects before preparing a presentation to the class.

            Unit 6 explores the role of hardware platforms in computing and how different sensors can provide more effective input and output than the traditional keyboard, mouse, and monitor. Using App Lab and Adafruit’s Circuit Playground, you’ll develop programs that utilize the same hardware inputs and outputs that you see in the smart devices, looking at how a simple rough prototype can lead to a finished product. The unit concludes with a design challenge to use the Circuit Playground as the basis for an innovation of your own design.

              description_student: In this lesson, you will start to build apps that allow for lots of user interaction and functionality ... even though they are just one screen!
              description_teacher: In Unit 4 students learned a very simple approach to app development in App Lab that required a separate screen for most interactions. To expand the kinds of apps that students can make, and to encourage them to think in new ways about how users interact with apps, we introduce the [`setProperty()`(#fff176)](/docs/applab/setProperty/) block. This command can be used to set the content and properties of various UI elements, allowing students to write programs that update information on a single screen, instead of manually creating duplicate screens. In this lesson students build up simple apps that only require a single screen, the content of which is changed using [`setProperty()`(#fff176)](/docs/applab/setProperty/).
            The Circuit Playground:

              description_student: 'In this lesson, you will get to know the Circuit Playground, the circuit board that will be used throughout the rest of this unit. '
              description_teacher: In this lesson students get their first opportunity to write programs that use the Circuit Playground. After first inspecting the board visually and hypothesizing possibly functionalities, students move online where they will learn to write applications that control an LED. By combining App Lab screens with the Circuit Playgrounds, students can gradually start to integrate elements of the board as an ouput device while relying on App Lab for user input.

              description_student: 'In this lesson, you will eperience two different ways that an app can collect input from a user, while learning more about the event-driven programming model used in App Lab.

'
              description_teacher: In preparation for delving deeper into programming with App Lab, students will explore how a handful of different programs written in both Game Lab and App Lab handle taking input from the user. After comparing and contrasting the approaches they saw in the example apps, students group up to act out the two different models for input (conditionals in an infinite loop and asynchronous events) to gain a better understanding of how they work.
            Board Events:
              key: Board Events
              name: Board Events
              description_student: In this lesson, you will learn how to use the Circuit Playground's hardware buttons and switch which will give the Circuit Playground input.
              description_teacher: This lesson transitions students from consider the Circuit Playground as strictly an output device towards using it as a tool for both input and output. Starting with the hardware buttons and switch,sing the hardware buttons and switch, students learn to use [`onBoardEvent()`(#f78183)](/docs/applab/onBoardEvent/), analogously to [`onEvent()`(#fff176)](/docs/applab/onEvent/), in order to take input from their Circuit Playgrounds.

              description_student: 'In this lesson, you will learn how to access the properties of different elements with code. '
              description_teacher: This lesson introduces students to the [`getProperty`(#fff176)](/docs/applab/getProperty/) block, which allows them to access the properties of different elements with code.  Students first practice using the block to determine what the user has input in various user interface elements. Students later use [`getProperty`(#fff176)](/docs/applab/getProperty/) and [`setProperty`(#fff176)](/docs/applab/setProperty/) together with the counter pattern to make elements move across the screen.  A new screen element, the slider, and a new event trigger, `onChange`, are also introduced.
            Analog Input:
              key: Analog Input
              name: Analog Input
              description_student: 'In this lesson, you will get to explore the analog inputs on the Circuit Playground, writing programs that respond to the environment through sensors.

'
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students explore how the three analog sensors (sound, light, and temperature) can be used to write programs that respond to changes in the environment. The use of these sensors marks a transition in terms of how users interact with a program. By using sensors as an input, the user of an app doesn't have to directly interact with it at all, or may interact without actually realizing they are doing so.

              name: The Program Design Process
              description_student: 'In this lesson, you will learn about the process you will use to design programs of your own throughout this unit. '
              description_teacher: This lesson introduces students to the process they will use to design programs of their own throughout this unit. This process is centered around a project guide which asks students to sketch out their screens, identify elements of the Circuit Playground to be used, define variables, and describe events before they begin programming. This process is similar to the Game Design Process that we used in Unit 3. In this lesson students begin by playing a tug o' war style game where the code is hidden. They discuss what they think the board components, events, and variables would need to be to make the program. They are then given a completed project guide which shows one way to implement the project. Students are then walked through this process through a series of levels. At the end of the lesson students have an opportunity to make improvements to the program to make it their own.

              description_teacher: |+
                For this project, students design and create a game that leverages the new inputs and outputs that are available to them. This project is purposefully left very open-ended to empower students to think broadly about how physical output might be useful in an app, while still giving them a chance to review the program development process and try out the new features available through the Circuit Playground.


            Arrays and Color LEDs:

              name: Arrays and Color LEDs
              description_student: 'In this lesson, you will learn how to access the colorLEDs array that controls the behavior of the color LEDs on the Circuit Playground. '
              description_teacher: An array is an ordered collection of items, usually of the same type. In this lesson, students learn ways to access either a specific or random value from a list using its index.  They then learn how to access the colorLEDs array that controls the behavior of the color LEDs on the Circuit Playground.  Students will control the color and intensity of each LED, then use what they have learned to program light patterns to create a light show on their Circuit Playground.
            Making Music:
              key: Making Music
              name: Making Music
              description_student: 'In this lesson, you will use the Circuit Playground’s buzzer feature to its full extent by producing sounds, notes, and songs. '
              description_teacher: In this lesson students will use the buzzer to its full extent by producing sounds, notes, and songs with the buzzer. Students start with a short review of the buzzer's frequency and duration parameters, then move on to the concept of notes.  Notes allow students to constrain themselves to frequencies that are used in Western music and provide a layer of abstraction that helps them to understand which frequencies might sound good together.  Once students are able to play notes on the buzzer, they use arrays to hold and play sequences of notes, forming simple songs.
            Arrays and For Loops:
              key: Arrays and For Loops
              name: Arrays and For Loops
              description_student: 'In this lesson, you will learn to combine lists and for-loops in order to write code that impacts every element of a list, regardless of how long it is. '
              description_teacher: Using a _for loop_ to iterate over all of the elements in an array is a really useful construct in most programming languages. In this lesson, students learn the basics of how a _for loop_ can be used to repeat code, and then combine it with what they've already learned about arrays to write programs that process all elements in an array. Students use for loops to go through each element in a list one at a time without having to write code for each element. Towards the end of the lesson students will apply this with the `colorLed` list on the board to create an app that changes all of the LEDs each time a button is clicked.
            Accelerometer:
              key: Accelerometer
              name: Accelerometer
              description_student: 'In this lesson, you will explore the accelerometer and its capabilities. '
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students will explore the accelerometer and its capabilities. They’ll become familiar with its events and properties, as well as create multiple programs utilizing the accelerometer similar to those they’ve likely come across in real world applications.

              name: Functions with Parameters
              description_student: 'In this lesson, you will create and call functions with parameters, use for loops to iterate over an array, and finally use what you have learned to create a star catching game.

'
              description_teacher: The lesson starts with a quick review of parameters, in the context of App Lab blocks that they students have seen recently.  Students then look at examples of parameters within user-created functions in App Lab and create and call functions with parameters for themselves, using them to control multiple elements on a screen.  Afterwards, students use for loops to iterate over an array, passing each element into a function.  Last, students use what they have learned to create a star catching game.

              description_student: 'In this lesson, you will wire simple circuits to create a physical prototype using low-cost and easily-found materials.

'
              description_teacher: In preparation for this chapter's final project, students will learn how to develop a prototype of a physical object that includes a Circuit Playground. Using a modelled project planning guide, students will learn how to wire a couple of simple circuits and to build prototypes that can communicate the intended design of a product, using cheap and easily found materials such as cardboard and duct tape.

                * How does software interact with hardware?
                * How can computers sense and respond to their environment?
                * What kind of information can be communicated with simple hardware outputs?
              description: This unit begins with an activity that encourages students to explore a wide variety of non-traditional computing platforms, before kicking off a review of programming in App Lab, with a particular focus on better understanding the event-driven programming model that was first introduced in Unit 4. Students learn techniques to make the apps they write more flexible by modifying design elements through code instead of always relying on design mode. Using the Circuit Playground, they then explore different approaches to taking input and producing output using hardware. By the end of this chapter, students will design a develop a game that uses physical hardware for input and output.

                * How can complex real-world information be represented in code?
                * How can simple hardware be used to develop innovative new products?
              description: With an understanding of how to use hardware to take input and produce output, students move to thinking about more complex programs that integrate hardware and software. Using the color LEDs as an example of a a group of like objects, students learn how to use arrays to keep track of lists of values. From there we introduce the for loop, first simply as a way to repeat a block of code, and then as a way to run code on each element of an array. By the end of this chapter students will have explored all components of their boards while learning to structure their code using arrays, loops, and parametric functions. In the final two lessons students have an opportunity to dig into building physical prototypes using their boards.

              description_teacher: Welcome to Computer Science Principles! The first lesson is about getting students excited about the course and connecting their own personal interests to computer science.  Students are asked to share something they know a lot about and teach it to a small group.  Groups make a “rapid” prototype of an innovative idea and share it.  Students watch a brief video about computing innovations.  The lesson ends with students logging into the Code.org CSP course web site, and answering a brief prompt about what “computer science” means to them.
            Representing Information:

              name: Circle Square Patterns
              description_student: Develop a system for creating and ordering patterns of shapes.
              description_teacher: Students will create rules for ordering patterns of circles and squares. Students generate all possible messages with three place values, then create rules that explain how they ordered each message. Emphasis is placed on creating clear rules so that, if another group were to follow the rules, they would generate the same list in the same order. Using these rules, students then try to list all possible messages with four place values. As the lesson concludes, students share their rules with classmates.
            Binary Numbers:
              key: Binary Numbers
              name: Binary Numbers
              description_student: In this lesson, students will practice representing numbers in binary (base 2), transitioning from the circle-square representations they made in the last lesson. Students will create and use a "Flippy Do", a manipulative which helps students convert between binary (base 2) and decimal (base 10) numbers. They will practice converting numbers and explore the concept of place value in the context of binary numbers.

              name: Representing Text
              description_student: Develop a system for representing text using bits based on what you already know about representing numbers.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students create a system for representing text using only numbers while communicating with each other. They are only allowed to send numbers back-and-forth, so they must create a system to translate between number and character. At the end of the main activity they briefly review the ASCII system for representing text. The wrap up discussion emphasizes how all of the concepts thus far have ‘built’ on each other and introduces the concept of abstraction to describe this progression.

              name: Black and White Images
              description_student: Learn how computers represent black and white images using bits.
              description_teacher: Students explore how black and white images are represented.  Students use the black and white pixelation widget to represent each pixel of an image with black or white light.  They learn how to sample an analog image using small squares of uniform size (each represented with a black or white value) and reflect on the pros and cons of choosing a smaller or larger square size when sampling.
            Color Images:
              key: Color Images
              name: Color Images
              description_student: Learn how computers represent color images using bits.
              description_teacher: This is a second opportunity for students to interact with the Pixelation Widget, but this time they will work with color pixels.  Students start off learning that each pixel uses red, green, and blue lights that can be turned on or off using bits. They will create more color variants using an increasing amount of bits per pixel, and apply their learning by approximating an analog color image using the widget.
            Lossless Compression:
              key: Lossless Compression
              name: Lossless Compression
              description_student: Learn how computers can decrease the number of bits used to represent a piece of information.
              description_teacher: Students use the Text Compression Widget to experiment with compressing songs and poems and try to find their ‘personal best’ compression. A video introduces important vocabulary for the lesson and demonstrates the full features of the widget. Students pick a text they think will be ‘easy’ to compress and one they think will be ‘difficult’, paying attention to why some texts might be more compressible than others. As a wrap-up, students discuss what factors make some texts more compressible than others.
            Lossy Compression:
              key: Lossy Compression
              name: Lossy Compression
              description_student: Learn how information is represented using fewer bits when it's OK for some of the information or details to be lost.
              description_teacher: Students are introduced to lossy compression via the Lossy Text Compression widget. They apply this concept and their prior knowledge of sampling to create their own lossy compressions of image files using the Lossy Image Widget. Students then discuss several practical scenarios where they need to decide whether to use a lossy or lossless compression algorithm. The lesson ends with a discussion of the situations where lossless compression is important and the situations where lossy compression is important.
            Intellectual Property:
              key: Intellectual Property
              name: Intellectual Property
              description_student: Learn about how people can own digital information and the ways they can share access to their creative digital works.
              description_teacher: Students are asked to reflect on who owns their creative works from this class, such as their pixel images, before reading an article describing how ownership can become complicated as analog works become digital artifacts. After reading the article, students watch several videos explaining copyright and introducing them to the Creative Commons. Students then re-read the article answering three questions about the benefits, harms, and impacts of current copyright policy. Students use their new understanding of copyright to form an opinion about current copyright policies and create a small poster justifying their opinion with a quote from the article.

              description_student: Read about a current event or societal challenge created by the digitization of information.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students begin tackling the question of whether digitizing information has made the world a better or worse place. To begin the lesson, students place stickies on a spectrum of "worse" to "better" to state their opinion prior to doing the activity. Students then choose an article they are interested in reading using a process the class completed collectively in the previous lesson. Students will discuss their preliminary reading and opinions after today's lesson and will have a chance to start making an artifact to present their findings.

                ### Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy


                * **Establishing a Strong Classroom Culture:** This unit is designed to be hands-on, collaborative, and exploratory. A major focus of the unit is building a positive classroom culture in which students work together, explore problems, and communicate about their thinking. Most lessons either feature physical manipulatives or a digital widget, and the bulk of lesson time should be spent with students exploring these tools together to develop an understanding of the concepts they highlight. The course intentionally does not start with programming since, in many classrooms, some students have experience with programming and others do not. Choosing to begin with digital information and the internet lets you build community in the room while exploring a topic that is likely to be accessible to all students. The supportive and inclusive classroom environment built in this unit should help set a positive tone that can be carried through the school year.


                * **Empowering "Deciders":**  An important goal of the course is not merely to teach students technical knowledge, but to put those skills to work in meaningful ways. This unit builds towards the unit project, which provides an opportunity for students to be "deciders" about the impacts of computing on modern life. Other units will emphasize empowering units as "creators."

                ### Major Assessment and Projects

                The unit project asks students to consider and debate issues that arise in modern society due to the digitizing of information. Students will analyze an article that addresses the intersection of digitizing information and current events. They will evaluate what data is being digitized and evaluate the benefits and harms caused by making this information digital. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.

                ### AP Connections

                This unit and its associated project help build towards the enduring understandings listed below. For a detailed mapping of units to Learning Objectives and EKs, please see the "Standards" page for this unit.

                * DAT-1: The way a computer represents data internally is different from the way the data is interpreted and displayed for the user. Programs are used to translate data into a representation more easily understood by people.
                * IOC-1: while computing innovations are typically designed to achieve a specific purpose, they may have unintended consequences

              description_teacher: Students complete a scheduling challenge three times, once unplugged, and twice on the Internet Simulator, to explore the need for addressing messages online. Students first complete a challenge where they are allowed to talk to one another to fill out a weekly schedule. They then move on to a version of the Internet Simulator where all of their messages are "broadcast" or sent to everyone in the same simulator room. This challenge forces students to develop shared rules for communicating to complete the scheduling activity a second and then third time. The wrap up helps students connect their experiences to real-life rules, or protocols, used on the Internet for addressing messages.

              description_teacher: Students spend most of today’s lesson in an updated Internet Simulator that lets students send messages with a dedicated To and From IP  Address. Students start by connecting to a dedicated router and sending messages only to each other. They look at the router logs to find other students on different routers, then send messages to those students. They look at the router logs again to notice that messages are being passed between routers in order to reach their destination. Students continue to send messages and view the logs one last time to notice that the messages are also taking different paths to reach the same destination. The lesson wraps-up by introducing new vocabulary and using these words to summarize today’s activity.

              description_teacher: Students learn that large messages sent over the Internet are actually divided into individual packets and explore the challenges this creates. First students explore a version of the Internet Simulator that breaks messages into packets to get a sense for how it works. Students then use an activity guide that walks them through the challenges that dropped or out-of-order packets create. They then design their own protocol that addresses these challenges. At the end of the lesson students watch a video and learn and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), two different protocols for sending messages broken into packets.

It is designed to maintain the collaborative and inclusive classroom environment developed in the previous two units. The collaborative project, fun, unplugged activities, and the focus on experimenting should help keep your whole class working together and trying out ideas. \n\n* **Emphasizing Skills:** Since this is the first of many programming units, it emphasizes attitudes and skills that will serve your students well for the remainder of the year. The project that runs through this unit emphasizes that programming is a creative and collaborative endeavor that students can use to help others. Key practices like pair programming and debugging help normalize working with a partner, asking for help, and making mistakes. While students have a lot to learn about programming and App Lab, there is just as much emphasis on establishing these positive habits and mindsets. \n\n* **Empowering \"Creators\":** This unit empowers students to be creators with a major emphasis on making personally meaningful apps. Students have a lot to learn about programming. Still, the goal is for students to come away from this unit, seeing programming as a powerful form of personal expression that allows them to draw on their innate talents and interests to help solve problems in their community.\n\n### Major Assessment and Projects\n\nThe unit project asks students to collaborate with a classmate to design an app that can teach others about a topic of shared interest. Students practice interviewing classmates to identify the project's goals, mockup designs, collaboratively program the app and run simple user tests. The app itself must include at least three screens and demonstrate what students have learned about user interface design and event-driven programming. Students submit their app, project guide, and written responses to reflection questions about how the app is designed and the development process used to make it. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n\n### AP Connections\n\nThis unit and unit project helps build towards the enduring understandings listed below.

                ### Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy


                * **Intro to EIPM:** This unit is students' first experience with the Explore, Investigate, Practice, Make lesson sequence, or EIPM. This structured approach to teaching programming is covered in detail in the curriculum guide. We highly recommend watching the [accompanying video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNeqEl6MN7c2KyM3gdBSo8t3) to better understand what EIPM should look like in the classroom. When used effectively, it supports deep learning of content and helps maintain a collaborative classroom culture, even as you move into more complex programming concepts.

                * **Scaffolding Towards Independent Projects:** A major goal of this course is to empower students to design and build projects independently. The Create PT in Unit 8 offers students enormous freedom to scope and build projects, and even this unit begins scaffolding towards that goal. Individual EIPM sequences of lessons gradually prepare students for scoped, independent Make projects. The unit project has a few requirements, but students are largely free to choose the design, topic, and implementation of their ideas. As you teach the unit, look for the opportunities to scaffold the skills and knowledge students will need to creatively and independently tackle the unit project.


                ### Major Assessment and Projects

                The unit project asks students to design an app that makes a recommendation based on information from user input. Students are given a great deal of freedom to choose their topic, design their user interface, and decide how to actually program their app's behavior. Students submit their app, project guide, and written responses to reflection questions about how the app is designed and the development process they used to make it. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.

                ### Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy

                * **Independent Creation and The Hackathon Project:** Much like the project in Unit 4, the "Hackathon" project in this unit is designed as an opportunity for students to creatively and independently build something with their programming skills. While students are asked to include some technical requirements in their program to ensure they demonstrate mastery of new programming concepts, they have free rein to choose the goals, design, and implementation of their project. To avoid asking students to complete a major programming project right before the Create PT, this hackathon is the most "Create-PT-like" project of the course. It is the best chance for students to practice skills like budgeting time or scoping an open-ended project. In many classrooms, if you maintain the recommended pacing of the course, this project serves as an excellent end to the first semester.

                * **Growing Comfort with EIPM:** By Unit 5, students (and teachers!) should be developing greater comfort with the flow of EIPM lessons. Students may begin to anticipate that sequences build towards an independent Make lesson or look forward to stepping away from computers to Explore. A nice feature of EIPM is that you will find strategies and modifications to each lesson type that work best for your students. Keep an eye out for how you and your students are developing comfort with EIPM and note strategies that help meet your classroom's needs.

                * **Programming with Real-world Data:** The Data Library is a new feature in App Lab for the 2020-21 school year and was designed to let students program with data from the real world. This tool aims to motivate students to build new kinds of data-powered apps that they find personally interesting. This tool also facilitates programming with lists of information since students will need to manipulate lists of data to incorporate the different data sources. Encourage students to use datasets they find personally relevant as they draw on their creative ideas for bringing data to life.



                ### Major Assessment and Projects

                The unit project asks students to spend five days as part of a "Hackathon" project that they have nearly complete independence to scope and design. Students must choose one dataset from the Data Library in AppLab to be a component of their project to demonstrate what they have learned about lists and list processing; otherwise, scoping the project is completely up to them. Students submit their app, project guide, and written responses to reflection questions about how the app is designed and the development process they used to make it. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.

                ### AP Connections

                This unit and unit project helps build towards the enduring understandings listed below. For a detailed mapping of units to Learning Objectives and EKs, please see the "Standards" page for this unit.

                * CRD-2: Developers create and innovate using an iterative design process that is user-focused, incorporating implementation/feedback cycles, which leaves ample room for experimentation and risk-taking.
                * AAP-1: To find specific solutions to generalizable problems, programmers represent and organize data in multiple ways.
                * AAP-2: The way statements are sequenced and combined in a program determines the computed result. Programs incorporate iteration and selection constructs to represent repetition and make decisions to handle varied input values.
                * AAP-3: Programmers break down problems into smaller and more manageable pieces. By creating procedures and leveraging parameters, programmers generalize processes that they can reuse. Procedures allow programmers to draw upon existing code that has already been tested, allowing them to write programs more quickly and more confidently.

                This unit includes content from the following topics from the AP CS Principles Framework. For more detailed information on topic coverage in the course review [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dqYF5u0AULjw049gaCwAP34ZSe0VuEWbAjWoH1-YMW0/edit?usp=sharing).

              description_teacher: Students will complete two exploratory activities that introduce the concept of a problem and an algorithm. In the first students answer a series of questions about birthdates and names of their classmates. They then discuss the similarities and differences between the problems. In the second activity students are given six different algorithms and must analyze them to determine which they think are the same or different. At the end of the lesson they are introduced to the formal definitions of a problem and an algorithm.

              description_teacher: Students investigate two different types of raffles that highlight the way seemingly small problems can quickly grow large. The first raffle asks students to hunt for pairs of tickets that add to a target value. The second raffle asks students to hunt for any group of tickets that adds to a target value. After trying out each raffle live students will try to figure out the patterns for how many total combinations need to be checked in each. At the end they discuss the difference between reasonable and unreasonable algorithms based on their experiences.

Then they run a series of demonstrations that show how simple tasks like sorting cards get faster when more people help, but there is a limitation to the efficiency gains. Later in the lesson students watch a video about distributed computing that highlights the ways distributed computing can help tackle new kinds of problems. To conclude the lesson students record new vocabulary in their journals and discuss any open questions.

                ### Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy


                * **A Break from Programming:** This unit is intentionally designed as a short respite from programming. After three units and a major hackathon project, it is a great opportunity to get away from screens for a while before the final programming push that leads to the Create PT.

                * **Just Enough Math:** This unit includes some mathematical concepts which enrich students' understanding of how algorithms are analyzed, which might at first be a little intimidating to some students (and teachers!). The mathematical topics included in this unit are only those necessary to provide a solid foundation in algorithmic analysis to the depth described in the CS Principles framework. If you are a teacher with a strong mathematical background, check carefully that you do not needlessly add complexity to a unit that might already prove challenging for some students. All teachers should keep an eye out for the ways visuals, hands-on examples, and patterns in presentation style are used to ensure a consistent presentation of these mathematical topics.


                ### Major Assessment and Projects

                This unit does not conclude with a major project. Students will complete an end-of-unit assessment that is aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.

              description: "### Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy\n\n* **Learning by Building Libraries:** In the second EIPM sequence of this unit, students learn to use the Student-Create Libraries tool in App Lab. This tool allows them to build and share libraries of functions that they can use in many different projects. This tool serves many purposes besides simply teaching students about libraries. By having to write functions that other students find useful, they will need to think about common patterns or situations that they have seen in projects across the course. Students will also practice commenting their code so others can understand how it works, practice designing functions that use parameters and return.  \n\n* **Final Preparation for the Create PT:** Students learn very few new concepts in this unit; nevertheless, it can be challenging because students need to learn how to integrate the ideas of parameters and return with every other concept they have learned in this course. This unit presents a good opportunity to do a final review of every programming construct covered in the course as students prepare to demonstrate what they've learned on the Create PT.\n\n### Major Assessment and Projects\n\nThe unit project asks students to design a library of functions that they can share with classmates. Their library must contain at least two functions, and at least one of those functions must include a parameter, return, a loop, and an if-statement. This requirement ensures students practice skills they willll use in the Create PT. Using a project guide, students choose a theme for their library, build it, test it, and exchange feedback with other students. Students submit their library code, project guide, and written responses to reflection questions about how the app is designed and the development process they used to make it. They will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n\n### AP Connections\n\nThis unit and unit project helps build towards the enduring understandings listed below. For a detailed mapping of units to Learning Objectives and EKs, please see the \"Standards\" page for this unit.\n\n* CRD-2: Developers create and innovate using an iterative design process that is user-focused, that incorporates implementation/feedback cycles, and that leaves ample room for experimentation and risk-taking.\n* AAP-2: The way statements are sequenced and combined in a program determines the computed result. Programs incorporate iteration and selection constructs to represent repetition and make decisions to handle varied input values.\n* AAP-3: Programmers break down problems into smaller and more manageable pieces. By creating procedures and leveraging parameters, programmers generalize processes that can be reused. Procedures allow programmers to draw upon existing code that has already been tested, allowing them to write programs more quickly and with more confidence.\n\nThis unit includes content from the following topics from the AP CS Principles Framework. For more detailed information on topic coverage in the course review [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dqYF5u0AULjw049gaCwAP34ZSe0VuEWbAjWoH1-YMW0/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n* 3.12 Calling Procedures\n* 3.13 Developing Procedures\n* 3.14 Libraries\n\nThe College Board has supplied formative Create PT questions to help prepare students to complete the Create Task. We recommend that students complete the following prompts with the unit project. More information can be found in Code.org CS Principles Topic Coverage.\n\n* 3.c.i\n* 3.c.ii\n* 3.c.iii\n* 3.c.iv\n* 3.d.i\n* 3.d.ii\n* 3.d.iii"

              description: "### Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy\n\n* **Learning Through Full-class Simulation:** The simulation project that runs through this unit serves several important goals. It helps contextualize what students are learning by moving from abstract ideas of privacy or security to concrete potential innovations. Since the simulation is based on modernizing schools, students can consider the consequences of computing innovations in a familiar setting. By taking on an assigned role and interacting with a group of teammates who have done the same, students must consider a breadth of interests and goals beyond their own when it comes to innovating in schools. \n\n* **Ending the Year as \"Deciders\":** A major theme students engage with throughout this unit is the need to consider both sides of technological innovation. Computing technology has led to both benefits and harms to culture, economy, and society at large. Responding to important questions facing our world requires understanding technology and an ability to identify and interpret the impacts it causes. This unit is not designed to advocate for any particular point of view on the impact of technology. Still, it should empower students to adeptly see and weigh the consequences of the technology around them. While the Create PT may feel like the most significant project of this course, the Explore Curricular requirement and the questions faced in this unit are arguably more crucial. Many of the young people who take CS Principles may pursue studies or careers in which they are \"creators\" with technology, but all of them will need to be thoughtful \"deciders\" in a world profoundly shaped by computing. \n\n\n### Major Assessment and Projects\n\nStudents complete the Future School Convention simulation throughout this unit. Working in teams of roughly five people, students are assigned a role and a set of interests they'll need to investigate. They research real-world innovations that could improve schools and align with the interests of their character. Throughout the unit, they are given opportunities to refine their proposals as a team and debate the benefits and risks of different computing innovations. Eventually, their team submits an overall proposal for the Future School, and all students vote for the team and innovation they believe to be the best. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with the CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n\n### AP Connections\n\nThis unit and unit project helps build towards the enduring understandings listed below. For a detailed mapping of units to Learning Objectives and EKs please see the \"Standards\" page for this unit.\n\n* IOC-1: While computing innovations are typically designed to achieve a specific purpose, they may have unintended consequences.\n* IOC-2: The use of computing innovations may involve risks to your personal safety and identity.\n\nThis unit includes content from the following topics from the AP CS Principles Framework. For more detailed information on topic coverage in the course review [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dqYF5u0AULjw049gaCwAP34ZSe0VuEWbAjWoH1-YMW0/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n* 5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects\n* 5.6 Safe Computing"

Learn how data can pose a threat to our privacy and security, and the ways that encryption and other techniques are used to complete it. Throughout the unit participate in a \"school of the future\" conference in which you and a team make a proposal for how best to improve school life with computing innovations.\r\n\r\n"

          title: CSD Unit 4 - The Design Process ('21-'22 Beta Preview)
          description: Unit 4 introduces the broader social impacts of computing. Through a series of design challenges, you will learn how to better understand the needs of others while developing a solution to a problem. The second half of the unit consists of an iterative team project, during which teams have the opportunity to identify a need that they care about, prototype solutions both on paper and in App Lab, and test solutions with real users to get feedback and drive further iteration.
          description_short: "  Learn how to design a program that meets the needs of your users."

            Analysis of Design:
              key: Analysis of Design
              name: Analysis of Design
              description_student: The class explores a variety of different teapot designs to consider how design choices or made and why. Using the teapots as an example, the class will explore the relationship between users, their needs, and the design of objects they use.
              description_teacher: To kick off a unit devoted to group problem solving and developing products for other users, students begin by investigating the design of various teapots. Students analyze each teapot, attempting to identify how specific user needs might have informed its design. By considering these design choices, and attempting to match each teapot with a potential user, students can begin to see how taking a user-centered approach to designing products (both physical and digital) can make those products more useful and usable. To conclude the activity, students are asked to propose some changes to one of the teapots that would make it more useful or usable.
            Understanding Your User:
              key: Understanding Your User
              name: Understanding Your User
              description_student: Using user profiles, the class explores how different users might react to a variety of products. Role playing as a different person, each member of the class will get to experience designs through someone else's eyes.
              description_teacher: "Designers need to understand their users’ needs in order to create useful products.  This lesson encourages students to think about how to design for another person by role-playing as someone else using a user profile and reacting as that user to a series of products.  Each student is assigned a user profile describing a person, which they then use to choose appropriate products, critique product design, and suggest improvements to design.\r\n"
            User-Centered Design Micro Activity:
              key: User-Centered Design Micro Activity
              name: User-Centered Design Micro Activity
              description_student: In small groups, the class uses the design process to come up with ideas for smart clothing. From brainstorming, to identifying users, to finally proposing a design, this is the first of several opportunities in this unit to practicing designing a solution for the needs of others.
              description_teacher: This lesson guides students through an abbreviated version of the design process they will be seeing throughout this unit. Students first brainstorm a list of potential users of smart clothing. As a class, they then group these ideas into broad categories and each group will choose one category of user. Groups repeat this process to brainstorm needs or concerns of their user, eventually categorizing these needs and choosing one to focus on. Finally, students design a piece of smart clothing, using the specific needs and concerns they brainstormed to guide their decision making. At the end of the class students quickly share their decision-making process and get feedback on how well their product addresses the user need they selected.
            User Interfaces:
              key: User Interfaces
              name: User Interfaces
              description_student: See how a paper prototype can be used to test and get feedback on software before writing any code. To help out a developer with their idea, the class tests and provides an app prototype made of paper.
              description_teacher: Following the mini design project, students look towards the next phase of design - prototyping a product that attempts to address user needs. In teams, students examine a paper prototype for a chat app called "Txt Ur Grndkdz". Through using this paper prototype, students get a chance to see how a simple paper prototype can be used to quickly test ideas and assumptions before we ever get to the computer. After "using" the provided prototype students begin to identify ways to improve the next iteration.
            Feedback and Testing:
              key: Feedback and Testing
              name: Feedback and Testing
              description_student: Users have been testing an app, and they have lots of feedback for the developer. The class needs to sort through all of this feedback, identify the common themes and needs, and start revising the prototype to make it better meet the users' needs.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students use feedback from "users" of the paper-prototyped app from the previous lesson in order to develop improvements to the user interface of that paper prototype. The lesson begins with a reflection on the fact that designers need to translate human needs with technology into changes to the user interface or experience. Students are then given a collection of feedback and requests from users of the app from the previous lesson. In groups students categorize the feedback and identify ways the needs expressed in the feedback could be met by changes to the interface of the app. Then in groups students will implement some of these changes to meet one of the needs they identified.
            Identifying User Needs:
              key: Identifying User Needs
              name: Identifying User Needs
              description_student: Up to this point the users that the class has considered have all been remote, and the only information from users has come through text or role playing. Now the class will rely on each other as potential users, and pairs will get to interview each other to identify needs that could be addressed by developing an app.
              description_teacher: 'Up to this point students have focused on designing for users who are, to some degree, distanced from them. Whether through brainstorming, profiles, or text feedback, the connection to an end user has never been direct. This is distance is designed to help students get outside their own head when thinking about users, but in order to get information more directly from an actual user, students need to rely on their classmates. In this lesson students pair up to become users (and designers) for each other, allowing everyone to directly interview their end user and ask questions to better inform their design. Each student pair interviews each other, attempting to identify a specific need that could be addressed by an app. '
            Project - Paper Prototype:
              key: Project - Paper Prototype
              name: Project - Paper Prototype
              description_student: Using the interview information from the previous lesson, the class comes up with app ideas to address the needs of their users. To express those ideas, and test out their effectiveness, each student creates and tests paper prototypes of their own.
              description_teacher: Based on the peer interview from the previous lesson, each student comes up with an idea for an app that will address their user's problem. Students then get to create their own paper prototype of their app ideas by drawing "screens" on individual notecards. A project guide directs students through the process including building the app and testing it with their user to see if their assumptions about the user interfaces they created are accurate.
            Designing Apps for Good:
              key: Designing Apps for Good
              name: Designing Apps for Good
              description_student: To kick off the app design project, the class organizes into teams and starts exploring app topics. Several example socially impactful apps serve as inspiration for the project.
              description_teacher: To kick off the app design project that lasts through the end of the unit, students first explore a number of apps designed for social impact that have been created by other students. The class then reviews the Define, Prepare, Try, and Reflect steps of the Problem Solving process as they develop an idea for an app of their own with social impact. Finally, students will form project teams and lay out a contract for how the team will function throughout the development of their app.
            Market Research:
              key: Market Research
              name: Market Research
              description_student: Dive into app development by exploring existing apps that may serve similar users. Each group identifies a handful of apps that address the same topic they are working on, using those apps to help refine the app idea they will pursue.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students research apps similar to the one they intend on creating to better understand the needs of their users. Students work within their teams to search the Internet for other apps, then evaluate the ones they find interesting. By the end of the lesson, each team will have a clearer idea about the type of app they want to create and further refine who their target users are. Each team will maintain a list of citations for all the apps they examined for use in their final presentation.
            Paper Prototypes:
              key: Paper Prototypes
              name: Paper Prototypes
              description_student: Paper prototypes allow developers to quickly test ideas before investing a lot of time writing code. In this lesson teams explore some example apps created in App Lab, using those apps to help inform the first paper prototypes of their apps.
              description_teacher: "Before starting to design apps, we need to help students to better scope their expectations. Because students will eventually be prototyping these apps in App Lab, they will be in better shape if their ideas align with the kinds of apps that are easily prototyped in App Lab. Teams start this scoping by looking through several example apps designed to demonstrate apps that can be created with App Lab. Teams then can chose one (or more) of the apps as a basis for their own. From there, teams have some time to discuss the basic functionality of their app before using 3x5 index cards to develop paper prototypes.\r\n"
            Prototype Testing:
              key: Prototype Testing
              name: Prototype Testing
              description_student: In this lesson teams test out their paper prototypes with other members of the class. With one student role playing the computer, one narrating, and the rest observing, teams will get immediate feedback on their app designs which will inform the next version of their app prototypes.
              description_teacher: The primary purpose of developing paper prototypes is that they allow for quick testing and iteration before any code is written. This lesson is focused on giving teams a chance to test their prototypes before moving to App Lab. Teams develop a plan to test with users before running prototype tests with multiple other students in the class (and potentially outside the class). In order to test the prototype with the users, the students will have to assign roles in the testing (the “narrator”, the “computer” and the “observers”) as well as have some questions prepared for the user to answer after the test is complete.
            Digital Design:
              key: Digital Design
              name: Digital Design
              description_student: Having developed, tested, and gathered feedback on a paper prototype, teams now move to App Lab to build the next iteration of their apps. Using the drag-and-drop Design Mode, each team member builds out at least one page of their team's app, responding to feedback that was received in the previous round of testing.
              description_teacher: Having collaboratively developed a paper prototype for their apps, groups now divide and conquer to begin work on an interactive digital version based on the paper prototype. Using the drag-and-drop design mode of App Lab, students individually work through a progression of skill-building levels to learn how to build digital versions of a paper prototype. From there, each group member builds out at least one page of their app in App Lab, to be later combined into a single app.
            Linking Screens:
              key: Linking Screens
              name: Linking Screens
              description_student: Building on the screens that the class designed in the previous lesson, teams combine screens into a single app. Simple code can then be added to make button clicks change to the appropriate screen.
              description_teacher: In this lesson teams combine the screens that they designed in the previous lesson into a single app, which they can then link together using code. Students learn basic event driven programming by building up the model app that they started in the previous lesson. In addition to the screen that students designed yesterday, they'll learn how to create additional screens and even import screens made by others.
            Testing the App:
              key: Testing the App
              name: Testing the App
              description_student: Teams run another round of user testing, this time with their interactive prototype. Feedback gathered from this round of testing will inform the final iteration of the app prototypes.
              description_teacher: 'By the end of the previous lesson each team should have a minimum viable prototype of their app. The primary purpose of this lesson is to have the team actually test the app with other people, preferably from the target audience the app is intended for, or from different teams in the class while observers from the team will record the results on the worksheets they used in the planning phase. As with testing the paper prototypes, teams will start by planning for the specific scenarios before running and observing tests. '
            Improving and Iterating:
              key: Improving and Iterating
              name: Improving and Iterating
              description_student: Using the feedback from the last round of testing, teams implement changes that address the needs of their users. Each team tracks and prioritizes the features they want to add and the bugs they need to fix.
              description_teacher: Teams have at this point developed an app prototype that has gone through multiple iterations and rounds of user testing. With the information and guidance gained from the last round of user testing, each student has the opportunity to plan for and implement improvements to the team app. Depending on the time you have available, and student interest, you can run the cycle of testing and iteration as many times as you see fit.
            Project - App Presentation:
              key: Project - App Presentation
              name: Project - App Presentation
              description_student: Each team prepares a presentation to "pitch" the app they've developed. This is the time to share struggles, triumphs, and plans for the future.
              description_teacher: At this point teams have researched a topic of personal and social importance, developed and tested both a paper prototype and a digital prototype, and iterated on the initial app to incorporate new features and bug fixes. Now is the time for them to review what they have done and pull together a coherent presentation to demonstrate their process of creation. Using the provided presentation template, teams prepare to present about their process of app development, including the problem they set out to solve, the ways in which they've incorporated feedback from testing, and their plans for the future.

              description_student: This first lesson provides an overview of what data is and how it is used to solve problems.  Groups use a data set to make a series of meal recommendations for people with various criteria.   Afterwards, groups compare their responses and discuss how the different representations of the meal data affected how the students were able to solve the different problems.
              description_teacher: In the first lesson of the data unit, students get an overview of what data is and how it is used to solve problems.  Students start off with a brief discussion to come to a common understanding of data.  They then split into groups and use a data set to make a series of meal recommendations for people with various criteria.  Each group has the choices of meal represented in a different way (pictures, recipes, menu, nutrition) that gives an advantage for one of the recommendations.  Afterwards, groups compare their responses and discuss how the different representations of the meal data affected how the students were able to solve the different problems.
            Patterns and Representation:
              key: Patterns and Representation
              name: Patterns and Representation
              description_student: This lesson looks closer at what is needed to create a system of representation.  Groups create systems that can represent any letter in the alphabet using only a single stack of cards, then create messages with their systems and exchange with other groups to ensure the system worked as intended.   The class discusses commonalities between working systems while recognizing that there are many possible working solutions.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students create their own system for representing information. They begin by brainstorming all the different systems they already use to represent yes-no responses. They then work in small groups to create a system that can represent any letter in the alphabet using only a single stack of cards. The cards used have one of 6 different possible drawings (6 animals, 6 colors, etc.) and so to represent the entire alphabet students will need to use patterns of multiple cards to represent each letter. Students create messages with their systems and exchange with other groups to ensure the system worked as intended. In the wrap-up discussion the class  reviews any pros and cons of the different systems. They discuss commonalities between working systems and recognize that there are many possible solutions to this problem and what's important is that everyone use the same arbitrary system to communicate.
            ASCII and Binary Representation:
              key: ASCII and Binary Representation
              name: ASCII and Binary Representation
              description_student: This lesson introduces a formal binary system for encoding information, the ASCII system for representing letters and other characters. At the beginning of the lesson the teacher introduces the fact that computers must represent information using either "on" or "off". The class is then introduced to the ASCII system for representing text using binary symbols and practices using this system before encoding their own messages using ASCII.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students learn to use their first binary system for encoding information, the ASCII system for representing letters and other characters. At the beginning of the lesson the teacher introduces the fact that computers must represent information using either "on" or "off". Then students are introduced to the ASCII system for representing text using binary symbols. Students practice using this system before encoding their own message using ASCII. At the end of the lesson a debrief conversation helps synthesize the key learning objectives of the activity.
            Representing Images:
              key: Representing Images
              name: Representing Images
              description_student: This lesson continues the study of binary representation systems, this time with images. The class is introduced to the concept of splitting images into squares or "pixels" which can then be turned on or off individually to make the entire image. After doing a short set of challenges using the Pixelation Widget, the class makes connections between the system for representing images and the system for representing text they learned in the previous lesson.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students learn how computers represent images. To begin the lesson they consider the challenge of turning all the complexity of vision into a binary pattern. Through a series of images showing how this transformation is made students are introduced to the concept of splitting images into squares or "pixels" which can then be turned on or off individually to make the entire image. Students then do a short set of challenges using the Pixelation Widget in order to draw black and white images. Puzzles are designed to call out some of the challenges of representing images in this way. In the wrap up students make connections between the system for representing images and the system for representing text they learned in the previous lesson.
            Representing Numbers:
              key: Representing Numbers
              name: Representing Numbers
              description_student: This lesson introduces the binary number system.  With a set of cards that represent the place values in a binary (base-2) number system, the class turns bits "on" or "off" by turning cards face up and face down, then observes the numbers that result from these different patterns.  Eventually, the pattern is extended to a generic 4-bit system.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students learn about the binary number system.  With a set of cards that represent the place values in a binary (base-2) number system by a collection of dots, students turn bits "on" or "off" by turning cards face up and face down, then observe the numbers that result from these different patterns.  Eventually, students extend the pattern to a generic 4-bit system.

              name: Keeping Data Secret
              description_student: Students have a discussion on the different levels of security they would like for personal data.  Once the class has developed an understanding of the importance of privacy, they learn about the process of encrypting information by enciphering a note for a partner and deciphering the partner's note.  The class concludes with a discussion about the importance of both physical and digital security.
              description_teacher: Students have a discussion on the different levels of security they would like for personal data.

              key: Combining Representations
              name: Combining Representations
              description_student: This lesson combines all three types of binary representation systems (ASCII characters, binary number, and images) to allow for the encode of more complex types information in a record.  After seeing a series of bits and being asked to decode them, the class is introduced to the idea that  understanding binary information requires understanding both the system that is being used and the meaning of the information encoded.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students use all three types of binary representation systems (ASCII characters, binary number, and images) to decode information in a record.  After seeing a series of bits and being asked to decode them, students are introduced to the idea that in order to understand binary information, they must understand both the system that is being used and the meaning of the information encoded.  They then decode a record representing a pet based on a given structure.

              name: Project - Create a Representation
              description_student: The class designs structure to represent their perfect day using the binary representation systems they've learned in this chapter. After deciding which pieces of information the record should capture, the class will decide how a punch card of bytes of information will be interpreted to represent those pieces of information. Afterwards, everyone will use the ASCII, binary number, and image formats they have learned to represent their perfect days try to decipher what a partner's perfect day is like.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students design a structure to represent their perfect day using the binary representation systems they've learned in this chapter. Students will first write a short description of their perfect day and then review with a partner to identify the key pieces of information they think a computer could capture. As a class students will decide how a punch card of bytes of information will be interpreted to represent those pieces of information. Students will then use the ASCII, binary number, and image formats they have learned to represent their perfect days. Students then trade punch cards and try to decipher what the other student's perfect day is like. The lesson ends with a reflection.

              name: Problem Solving and Data
              description_student: This lesson covers how the problem solving process can be tailored to deal with data problems, in particular.  The class is tasked with deciding what a city most needs to spend resources on.  They must find and use data from the Internet to support their decision.
              description_teacher: 'In this lesson, students use the problem solving process from earlier in the course to solve a data problem.  After reviewing the process, the class is presented with a decision: whether a city should build a library, pet shelter, or fire department.  Students work in teams to collect information on the Internet to help them decide what should be built, then use this information build an argument that will convince the city council of their choice.  They then map what they have done to the problem solving process that they have been using throughout the course, comparing the general problem solving process to its specific application to data problems.'
            Problem Solving with Big Data:
              key: Problem Solving with Big Data
              name: Problem Solving with Big Data
              description_student: This lesson covers how data is collected and used by a organizations to solve problems in the real world. The class looks at three scenarios that could be solved using data and brainstorms the types of data they would want to solve them and how they could collect the data.  Each scenario also includes a video about a real-world service that has solved a similar problem with data.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students look at how data is collected and used by organizations to solve problems in the real world. The lesson begins with a quick review of the data problem solving process they  explored in the last lesson. Then students are presented three scenarios that could be solved using data and brainstorm the types of data they would want to solve them and how they could collect the data. Each problem is designed to reflect a real-world service that exists. After brainstorming, students watch a video about a real-world service and record notes about what data is collected by the real-world service and how it is used. At the end of the lesson, students record whether data was provided actively by a user, was recorded passively, or is collected by sensors.
            Structuring Data:
              key: Structuring Data
              name: Structuring Data
              description_student: This lesson goes further into the interpretation of data, including cleaning and visualizing raw data sets.  The class first looks at the how presenting data in different ways can help people to understand it better.  After seeing how cleaning and visualization can help people make better decisions, the class looks at what parts of this process can be automated, and what need a human.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students go further into the collection and interpretation of data, including cleaning and visualizing data.  Students first look at the how presenting data in different ways can help people to understand it better, and they then create visualizations of their own data. Using a the results of a preferred pizza topping survey, students must decide what to do with data that does not easily fit into the visualization scheme that they have chosen.  Finally, students look at which parts of this process can be automated by a computer and which need a human to make decisions.
            Making Decisions with Data:
              key: Making Decisions with Data
              name: Making Decisions with Data
              description_student: This lesson gives the class a chance to practice the data problem solving process introduced in the last lesson.  Not all questions have right answers and in some cases the class can and should decide that they should collect more data. The lesson concludes with a discussion of how different people could draw different conclusions from the same data, or how collecting different data might have affected the decisions they made.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students get practice making decisions with data based on some problems designed to be familiar to middle school students. Students work in groups discussing how they would use the data presented to make a decision before the class discusses their final choices. Not all questions have right answers and in some cases students can and should decide that they should collect more data. The lesson concludes with a discussion of how different people could draw different conclusions from the same data, or how collecting different data might have affected the decisions they made.

              key: Interpreting Data
              name: Interpreting Data
              description_student: Students begin the lesson by looking at a cake preference survey that allows respondents to specify both a cake and an icing flavor.  They discuss how knowing the relationship between cake and icing preference helps them better decide which combination to recommend.  They are then introduced to cross tabulation, which allows them to graph relationships to different preferences.  They use this technique to find relationships in a preference survey, then brainstorm the different types of problems that this process could help solve.

              description_student: In this lesson students look at a simple example of how a computer could be used to complete the decision making step of the data problem solving process. Students are given the task of creating an algorithm that could suggest a vacation spot.  Students then create rules, or an algorithm, that a computer could use to make this decision automatically. Students share their rules and what choices their rules would make with the class data. They then use their rules on data from their classmates to test whether their rules would make the same decision that  a person would. The lesson concludes with a discussion about the benefits and drawbacks of using computers to automate the data problem solving process.

             ### Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy
            * **Intro to EIPM:** This unit is students' first experience with the Explore, Investigate, Practice, Make lesson sequence, or EIPM. This structured approach to teaching programming is covered in detail in the curriculum guide and we highly recommend that you watch the [accompanying video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNeqEl6MN7c2KyM3gdBSo8t3) to better understand what EIPM should look like in the classroom. When used effectively, it supports deep learning of content and helps maintain a collaborative classroom culture, even as you move into more complex programming concepts.
            * **Scaffolding Towards Independent Projects:** A major goal of this course is to empower students to design and build projects independently. The Create PT in Unit 8 offers students enormous freedoms to scope and build projects, and even this unit begins scaffolding towards that goal. Individual EIPM sequences of lessons gradually prepare students for scoped, independent Make projects. The unit project has a few requirements, but students are largely free to choose the design, topic, and implementation of their ideas. As you teach the unit, look for the opportunities to scaffold the skills and knowledge students will need to creatively and independently tackle the unit project.
            ### Major Assessment and Projects
            The unit project asks students to design an app that makes a recommendation based on input information from the user. Students are given a great deal of freedom to choose their topic, design their user interface, and decide how to actually program their app's behavior. Students submit their app, project guide, and written responses to reflection questions about how the app is designed and the development process they used to make it. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.
            ### AP Connections
            This unit and unit project helps build towards the enduring understandings listed below. For a detailed mapping of units to Learning Objectives and EKs please see the "Standards" page for this unit.
            * CRD-2: Developers create and innovate using an iterative design process that is user-focused, that incorporates implementation/feedback cycles, and that leaves ample room for experimentation and risk-taking.
            * AAP-1: To find specific solutions to generalizable problems, programmers represent and organize data in multiple ways.
            * AAP-2: The way statements are sequenced and combined in a program determines the computed result. Programs incorporate iteration and selection constructs to represent repetition and make decisions to handle varied input values.
            * AAP-3: Programmers break down problems into smaller and more manageable pieces. By creating procedures and leveraging parameters, programmers generalize processes that can be reused. Procedures allow programmers to draw upon existing code that has already been tested, allowing them to write programs more quickly and with more confidence.
            This unit includes content from the following topics from the AP CS Principles Framework. For more detailed information on topic coverage in the course review [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dqYF5u0AULjw049gaCwAP34ZSe0VuEWbAjWoH1-YMW0/edit?usp=sharing).
            * 1.4 Identifying and Correcting Errors
            * 3.1 Variables and Assignment
            * 3.3 Mathematical Expressions
            * 3.5 Boolean Expressions
            * 3.6 Conditionals
            * 3.7 Nested Conditionals
            * 3.15 Random Values
            The College Board has supplied formative Create PT questions to help prepare students to complete the Create Task. We recommend that students complete the following prompts with the unit project. More information can be found in Code.org CS Principles Topic Coverage.

              name: Welcome to CSA
              description_student: In this lesson, you explore software engineering values and the ways that you practice these values in other aspects of your life. By the end of this lesson, you discover your own software engineering identity!
              description_teacher: Believing in one's own software engineering identity develops confidence and perseverance. This lesson introduces core values of software engineering and explores common perceptions students may have. Students reflect on how they already practice many of these values to discover their own software engineering identity.
            lesson-2:
              name: Classes and Objects
              description_student: You explore how The Neighborhood works and learn some of the key components of the Java programming language. You meet the `Painter` and make changes to the code to learn what the `Painter` can do.
              description_teacher: 'Students access the Java Lab to explore The Neighborhood and are introduced to the `Painter` class. Students examine starter code and make simple modifications to achieve different outcomes with a `Painter` object and practice creating a `Painter` object to identify the relationship between a class and an object.

'
            lesson-3:
              name: Using Commands
              description_student: 'Now that you have met the `Painter`, you use action commands in this lesson to move the `Painter` around The Neighborhood. You learn about some of the rules of Java that you need to follow to make the Painter move.

'
              description_teacher: 'In this lesson, students implement solutions using action commands to move the `Painter` around The Neighborhood. Students develop computational thinking skills by translating solutions into Java code as they practice duplicating patterns. While solving these problems, students learn the importance of case-sensitivity and semicolons in Java and are exposed to the use of dot notation to call `Painter` commands.

'
            lesson-4:
              name: Conditionals and Debugging
              description_student: 'Now that you know how to use action commands, you help the `Painter` make decisions about how to interact with The Neighborhood using information-gathering commands. You also learn about debugging and identify strategies to use throughout the year.

'
              description_teacher: 'In this lesson, students modify programs using three return commands: `isOnPaint()`, `isOnBucket()`, and `canMove()`. Booleans, conditionals, and return statements are introduced through `if` statements and `Painter` return commands for students to practice using conditional logic in their programs. These concepts are discussed in more detail in future lessons and reinforced throughout the course. Students also develop debugging strategies by identifying syntax and logic errors.'
            lesson-5:
              name: More with Objects
              description_student: In this lesson, you learn how to make `Painter` objects by specifying where the `Painter` starts, what direction the `Painter` is facing, and the paint color. You also consider what makes "good code" and practice writing efficient code.
              description_teacher: The relationship between classes and objects is reinforced as students create their own objects. Students are introduced to creating objects both with and without parameters. Students begin to consider what makes 'good code' and practice writing efficient solutions.
            lesson-6:
              name: While Loops and Practice
              description_student: You have practiced moving the `Painter` and using conditionals to help the `Painter` make decisions about interacting with The Neighborhood. What if you could have the `Painter` repeat commands? In this lesson, you learn to use a `while` loop with some new commands to move the `Painter` around The Neighborhood.
              description_teacher: Students have learned a lot in their first week! In this lesson, students are introduced to the `while` loop and additional methods to control the movement of the `Painter` in The Neighborhood. Students combine their knowledge of methods, constructors, and control structures to develop solutions for increasingly complex puzzles
            lesson-7:
              name: More with Conditionals
              description_student: You have been using `if` statements to help the `Painter` make decisions to interact with The Neighborhood. In this lesson, you use `if-else` statements to give the `Painter` an alternative action. You also learn about the `!` (not) operator to help with the decisions the `Painter` makes.
              description_teacher: Students expand their knowledge of control structures and Boolean expressions using `if-else` statements and the `!` (not) logical operator. Students practice using the `if-else` statement and `!` (not) to solve more complex problems in addition to the `Painter` commands they have used so far.
            lesson-8:
              name: Introduction to Code Reviews
              description_student: 'As a software engineer, you want to develop code that is easy for others to read, maintain, and modify over time. In this lesson, you practice using code reviews to provide feedback and discuss strategies for giving and using feedback. These strategies will be useful throughout the year!

'
              description_teacher: In this course, students envision themselves as software engineers and model real-world career skills. Software engineers use code reviews throughout industry to develop code that is easy for others to read, maintain, and modify over time. Students are introduced to a code review process to lay the groundwork for skills they continue to build throughout the course.
            lesson-9:
              name: Inheritance and Methods
              description_student: By now, you have noticed that your `Painter` has limited commands to move around The Neighborhood. In this lesson, you create a new type of `Painter` that can do everything the `Painter` can as well as something the `Painter` can't!
              description_teacher: Students are introduced to inheritance by deriving a subclass of `Painter` with more commands. Students use the keyword `super` with constructors and learn how to write their own methods in the `PainterPlus` class. Students discover that methods that are called must be defined in their own class or the superclass. In future lessons, students add additional methods and subclasses of `Painter`.
            lesson-10:
              name: More Methods, More Features
              description_student: In this lesson, you give your `PainterPlus` class new ways to move around and interact with The Neighborhood. You consider edge cases when implementing your new methods.
              description_teacher: 'In this lesson, students continue to apply the principle of inheritance in their code by further expanding the `PainterPlus` class with three additional methods: `turnAround()`, `takeAllPaint()`, and `moveFast()`. To practice Java syntax and algorithmic thinking, students construct a step-by-step process for implementing each of the methods by hand before coding it in Java. By continuing to write and use new methods, students experience the benefits of reusability.

'
            lesson-11:
              name: Painting Methods
              description_student: In this lesson, you continue to expand your `PainterPlus` class, this time adding methods to move and paint horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines. You also participate in a code review to provide and receive feedback for improving code.
              description_teacher: 'Students continue to expand the `PainterPlus class`, this time adding four new methods that allow the `PainterPlus` to move and paint horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines. Students use pseudocode to write the methods, then implement them in the `PainterPlus` class in Java. Through the code review, students critique their methods and consider when it is appropriate to use methods they have written in the past by calling them in their new methods.

'
            lesson-12:
              name: SprayPainter
              description_student: Your `PainterPlus` has several ways to move around and interact with The Neighborhood. In this lesson, you develop a new type of `Painter` called `SprayPainter` with a `sprayPaint` method. With the `SprayPainter`, you create a mural and more interesting artwork in The Neighborhood.
              description_teacher: 'In this lesson, students apply their knowledge of methods and classes to write a new type of `Painter`, the `SprayPainter`, from scratch, including writing a new method with parameters: `sprayPaint(String color1, String color 2)`. The new `SprayPainter` class is implemented to create an abstract mural.'
            lesson-13:
              name: StampPainter
              description_student: You now have a `PainterPlus` and a `SprayPainter` that can be used to create artwork in The Neighborhood. In this lesson, you learn about pixel art and explore the opportunities of using technology in art and design. You develop a new type of `Painter` called the `StampPainter` that can paint custom shapes.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students continue to apply the principle of inheritance in their code by implementing the `StampPainter` class -- an extension of the `PainterPlus` class that paints customized shapes and images. This lesson serves as reinforcement to the previous lesson on inheritance. Students continue to practice deriving a new class based on an existing class, only adding new methods.
            lesson-14:
              name: Edge Cases
              description_student: In this lesson, you expand your software engineering skills to perform test-driven development. You explore new edge cases in The Neighborhood and make decisions about how you solve these problems. You discover that there is not always a single correct answer to solving problems – sometimes you have to make your own decisions about how you choose to handle edge cases!
              description_teacher: Before, students were given the starting Neighborhood; now, students design their own Neighborhood. The focus of the lesson is answering questions that do not have a single correct answer. Students discover the trade-offs in design decisions and practice justifying their decisions.
            lesson-15:
              name: Software Engineering Wrap Up
              description_student: 'You have learned a lot about being a software engineer! You revisit the core values of software engineering and reflect on how you used these throughout the unit.

            new lesson:
              name: Defining Attributes
              description_student: "Through our experiences in The Neighborhood, we know that classes and objects are key components of the Java programming language. But just how exactly do classes create objects? In this lesson, you explore how an object is created and learn about a process called data encapsulation. \n"
              description_teacher: In this unplugged lesson, students create objects and represent relevant attributes using instance variables. Students learn the difference between `public` and `private` and the purpose of encapsulation to hide the internal implementation of an object.
            lesson-2:
              name: Using Variables
              description_student: Variables provide a way for software engineers to store information. The type of information we need to store determines what kind of variable we need to use, its data type, and how we can use it. In this lesson, you use variables to store information used to create `Painter` objects and store information input by a user.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students explore the functionality of variables and differentiate between primitive and reference variables. Students use the `Scanner` class to obtain input from the user and define variables to store values provided by the user. These values are used to construct `Painter` objects in The Neighborhood.
            lesson-3:
              name: Writing Constructors
              description_student: The Project Mercury Pastries food truck needs your help! The owner wants to sell desserts in The Neighborhood but needs to be able to input and store their desserts in a program. You have been asked to use your software engineering skills to create a program that can create dessert objects so the owner can keep track of their inventory. You start by creating a `Dessert` class so the owner can enter the flavor, available quantity, and price of each dessert they sell.
              description_teacher: Students are introduced to the Project Mercury Pastries food truck and the owner's need for a program to input and store dessert items. As software engineers, students utilize object-oriented design strategies to identify necessary attributes and appropriate data types for a `Dessert` class. Students write a constructor and use a `Scanner` object to obtain values for the instance variables to initialize a `Dessert` object.
            lesson-4:
              name: Adding Multiple Constructors
              description_student: The Project Mercury Pastries food truck has grown in popularity! To help the owner fill orders, you improve the `Dessert` class to create `Dessert` objects more efficiently. To solve this problem, you implement overloaded constructors to simplify your code and add flexibility for creating `Dessert` objects. To fill standard orders, you create a default constructor to use default values for `Dessert`s.
              description_teacher: 'Students continue to work on the Project Mercury Pastries food truck program. Students write overloaded constructors for the `Dessert` class to provide multiple ways to instantiate `Dessert` objects. Students determine when it is appropriate to establish default values for one or more instance variables and use no-argument constructors. '
            lesson-5:
              name: Manipulating Variables and Object Data
              description_student: You explore the rules that a computer uses to determine the resulting value and type of an expression, similar to the ones you see in math class. You create expressions to get the computer to do the math for you.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students write and evaluate expressions using variables and object data. Students use arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %) and compound assignment (+=, -=, *=, /=, %=) operators to perform calculations involving variables and object data.
            lesson-6:
              name: Minimizing Errors in Initialization
              description_student: How can you make sure that the values given to a `Dessert` are correct? Remembering what you learned about edge cases, you add code to check for logic errors in the constructor. In this lesson, you explore where different types of variables are accessible and use these concepts to add another constructor to the `Dessert` class.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students implement conditionals and local variables to make decisions about object initialization and verify values passed to the constructor. Students explore the scope of local variables and parameters within a constructor and use the keyword `this` to refer to the current object. These concepts are used to add another constructor to the `Dessert` class.
            lesson-7:
              name: Writing Constructors for Hierarchies
              description_student: 'The owner of the Project Mercury food truck is expanding the menu to include different desserts. In this lesson, you use software development techniques to create classes and constructors for `Dessert` subclasses efficiently. To initialize inherited private instance variables, you use the `super` keyword to call the superclass constructor.  '
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students write constructors for superclasses and subclasses. Students use the `super` keyword to call the superclass constructor and pass any necessary parameters to the superclass constructor to initialize instance variables. The lesson introduces the D.R.Y. (Don’t Repeat Yourself) software development principle to highlight the benefits of using inheritance in object-oriented programming design.
            lesson-8:
              name: Accessing Object Data
              description_student: We have created private instance variables to represent attributes of `Dessert` objects, which means we cannot access these values from outside the class. But what if we needed to use these values in our programs? In this lesson, you explore methods that return values to write accessor methods for your `Dessert` class and its subclasses. You use these values to print out information about `Dessert` objects and within expressions to solve problems.
              description_teacher: Students discover the need for accessor methods to obtain the values stored in the instance variables of a class. Students identify the components of a method signature and explore how methods return values to use in programs. As students write accessor methods for the `Dessert` class and its subclasses, students work with printing these values and using object data within expressions.
            lesson-9:
              name: Modifying Object Data
              description_student: We have created accessor methods to obtain the value of instance variables of `Dessert` objects. What if we needed to change these values in our programs? In this lesson, you explore `void` methods to write mutator methods for your `Dessert` class and its subclasses. You use these methods along with accessor methods to solve problems. You strengthen your software development skills and processes through code reviews to give and use feedback to improve your program.
              description_teacher: Students discover the need for mutator methods to change the values stored in the instance variables of a class. As students write mutator methods for the `Dessert` class and its subclasses, they learn what `void` means, recall edge cases, and practice calling mutator and accessor methods. Students participate in a code review to give and receive feedback to improve their programs.
            lesson-10:
              name: Displaying Object Information
              description_student: 'Today we look ‘under the hood’ at some of the built-in classes we use in Java. You investigate `System.out.print()`, the `Object` class, and learn about the `toString()` method. You practice using the DRY principle to refactor your code in `Dessert` and `FoodTruck`. '
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students trace `System.out.print()` to explore the results of printing an `Object`. Students override a superclass method by writing `toString()` methods for `Dessert` and `FoodTruck`. Students concatenate instance variables and strings while also using escape sequences to format output.
            lesson-11:
              name: The Neighborhood Store Management Project - Day 1
              description_student: For this project, you work with a partner to create a management program for a business in The Neighborhood. You begin by planning the superclass and its subclasses using a Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram and creating the first draft of your superclass.
              description_teacher: For this project, students work with a partner to create a management program for a business in The Neighborhood.

              description_teacher: In the previous lesson, students planned their superclass and subclasses and began writing their superclass. Students begin this lesson by individually writing a subclass that extends their superclass. They participate in a code review and self-assess against the project rubric to give and use feedback as they develop their program.
            lesson-13:
              name: The Neighborhood Store Management Project - Day 3
              description_student: You finalize your super and subclass code using the prioritized list you created yesterday. You write your `main` method to interact with your classes, then you share your final projects with your peers and celebrate your success!
              description_teacher: In the previous lesson, students created a prioritized list of work to be completed. Students consider this list as they make revisions to their super and subclasses and then complete their main method. Finally, they share their final projects with peers to celebrate their successes.

            lesson-15:
              name: Assessment Day
              description_student: In this unit, you created objects and defined instance variables to represent attributes. You explored creating and using constructors to establish values for these attributes and how to work with the data stored in objects. You implemented accessor and mutator methods to access and modify the values stored in the instance variables and wrote `toString` methods to output information about the state of the object. You used the `Scanner` class to obtain user input to use as program data to create and work with your objects. You learned about using data types, operators, and expressions and implementing data encapsulation and object-oriented design. Now, you evaluate your achievement of the unit learning objectives and skills on a multiple-choice assessment.
              description_teacher: In this unit, students developed an understanding of data encapsulation and object-oriented design decisions to build a program to meet the needs of the Project Mercury Pastries food truck.

              description_student: Students are introduced to a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning and how they can use the Problem Solving Process to help train a robot to solve problems. They participate in three machine learning activities where a robot - A.I. Bot - is learning how to detect patterns in fish. In the first level, students train the robot to detect “fish” vs “not fish” and discover that more data leads to better accuracy. In the second level, students train A.I. Bot to detect certain colored fish or fish with a certain shape and discover that A.I. Bot might be basing its decision on unintended factors. In the last level, students train A.I. bot to detect expressions and discover that A.I. Bot may be using unrelated features to make decisions in a way that isn’t fair. The lesson ends by reaffirming how the Problem Solving Process is used in machine learning.

                **Question of the Day:** How can we use the Problem Solving Process to solve a problem with machine learning?
            lesson2:
              name: Supervised / Unsupervised
              description_student: Students first consider how they create “mental” models when learning new concepts, and how those can be similar to a “machine learning” model. They participate in a color pattern activity to simulate building a machine learning model without help, similar to a young child, as a type of unsupervised learning. Next, they play a game called "Green Glass Door" as an example of supervised learning, where they learn which words follow a certain pattern to go through a door in the game. Throughout the lesson, students are also introduced to the terms feature, label, and training which appear throughout the unit. Finally, students sort several scenarios into “supervised” or “unsupervised” learning, then watch a video about how neural networks can further simulate human learning.

              name: Decision Apps and Cross Tabs
              description_student: Students examine several apps that make decisions about what shoes to wear, ultimately building up to an understanding of how machine learning can help make this decision. The first app makes decisions randomly, which is a poor model for helping someone decide what shoes to wear. The second app makes decisions in a set pattern called a decision tree, which is better but is not responsive to its users. Students are guided to the conclusion that surveying their users can help them make the best decision by looking for patterns in the data and basing their decisions on these patterns. The lesson concludes by motivating the need for a computer to do this analysis and look for patterns in large amounts of data, which is the subject of the next lesson.

            lesson4:
              name: Unplugged SVM
              description_student: "**Question of the Day:** How do computers learn to classify data?"
              description_teacher: "Students participate in an unplugged activity simulating one of the machine learning algorithms computers use to separate data into groups to help make decisions. Students are tasked with helping a computer learn to classify food as fruits or vegetables. They begin by graphing 20 different fruits on two axes comparing “sweetness” to “easy to eat”. After they finish, they then try to separate the data into groups - a fruit area, and a veggie area. We then test their division by offering new fruits and veggies to classify, purposefully offering examples that will challenge their classification. At the end of the lesson, students reflect on how this process helped them make decisions and how much more difficult this process becomes when there is more data involved.\r\n\r\n**Question of the Day:** How do computers learn to classify data?"
            lesson5:
              name: AI Lab - Categorical Intro
              description_student: Students dive into the AI Lab tool for the first time, where they select features to train a model that predicts a given label. Students pretend they have been hired by several restaurants who would like to make recommendations to new customers based on survey data they’ve collected. Students go through each dataset, identifying the features of the data that they would like to use for their recommendations. Students also use data visualization tools to identify features with high relationships in the data, since not every feature may be useful or predictive for training a model. At the end of the lesson, students create a new model for a restaurant of their choosing and write a letter to the owner explaining how they can use their model to increase their restaurant business.

              description_student: 'Students are introduced to importing their models into App Lab and linking their model to their screens. The lesson starts by having them test a Buzzfeed-style quiz app that, over the course of the lesson, they recreate: What is your ideal vacation spot? Students start by importing the model from App Lab, then adding a missing screen in design mode, then adding if-statements to change screens, and finally linking all of the screens based on the result of the prediction. They can then choose another Buzzfeed style quiz to use as a model and design an app, using the skills they learned in this lesson.'

              name: Medical Model Cards
              description_student: In this lesson, students investigate a model for bias and are introduced to a Model Card, which is a way of representing important information about a trained model that could help uncover bias. The lesson starts with students investigating a Medical Priority app, which helps a hospital decide how soon to view patients based on their symptoms. Students are guided through an activity to help them realize that the app is biased based on personal information such as age, race, and gender. Students examine how this could happen based on the initial data used to train the model, then they explore how a Model Card is a tool that can help uncover potential bias. They explore several example model cards, making recommendations on whether or not the model could be biased based on the data.

              name: Unplugged KNN
              description_student: In this lesson, students take on the role of a modern middle school student surviving an unprecedented pandemic. They are one day granted responsibility for delivering the formula for a vaccine to a laboratory somewhere in their local area. To do so, they must use an intelligent personal assistant (IPA) named “Tom” to predict the safest route to the laboratory, which will require training Tom with a regression algorithm.

              name: App Lab - Custom Design Elts
              description_student: Students explore how to customize the code of their app to make additional changes to the design of their app. Students start by exploring a single-screen app that is crowded with too many features. They practice expanding the app to two-screens and updating the code to use the new design mode elements. After this, students help create a Driver Alert app that requires changes to the code using new design mode elements. Using the skills from this lesson, students will be able to create multi-screen apps where questions can appear on multiple screens instead of a single screen.
