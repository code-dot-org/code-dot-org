        desc: Ova lekcija će uvesti koncept računarstva i objasniti šta računarski
          znanstvenik radi.  Također će dati studentima priliku da preuzmu ulogu računarskog
          znanstvenika.  Do kraja aktivnosti, svaki student će imati podsjetnik onoga
          što je on ili ona naučio.  Možete biti u iskušenju da preskočite učenje
          djece o riječima koje se pojavljuju u kursu kojeg rade, ali predstavljajući
          ih u zabavnom i razigranom okruženju daleko je produktivnije nego čekanje
          vise naprednih mogucnosti.

        desc: With nothing but paper and markers, students will learn the four steps
          of computational thinking. After a brief introduction, students should be
          split into groups where they will have to create directions for other students
          to draw a specific monster (from a catalog of pre-selected monsters). The
          entire task must be decomposed, then teams will analyze all monsters in
          the catalog for patterns, abstract different details from the monsters,
          then use that information to create an algorithm (directions) for another
          team to draw a certain monster. Teams will then switch algorithms with another
          group and draw the monster based on what that algorithm indicates. Is the
          drawing what the original team intended?

          understand what programming is really about. The class will begin by students
          instructing each other to color squares in on graph paper in an effort to
          reproduce an existing picture.  If there's time, the lesson can conclude
          with images that the students create themselves.

          the first exercise will show how important it is to make each instruction
          as clear and unambiguous as possible.  Afterward, the class will explore
          how many ways you can fold paper into a rectangle, noting how some methods
          can take more or fewer folds than others.

        title: Funkcije
        desc: In this lesson, students will make a suncatcher out of string, beads,
          and a special charm. The students will follow a series of repetitive steps,
          then be asked to identify certain sets of "skills" that are duplicated several
          times. Once those skills are defined, they will be called from a main program
          and the whole beautiful process of creation will be recorded on a single
          sheet of paper. The final program will be geared toward the entire class,
          whatever their type of string, beads, and charms. To effectively allow for
          this, students will need to "abstract out" the details of their specific
          materials and create vague terms for an individual's supplies.  This use
          of generic placeholders is a wonderful introduction to variables.

          education on defining and calling functions. Once students are familiar

          along with passing parameters within those function calls.

          is the function.  Functions (sometimes called procedures) are mini programs
          that you can use over and over inside of your bigger program. This lesson

          functions is such a helpful practice.  '
      BinaryImages:
        title: Binary Images
        desc: Though many people think of binary as strictly zeros and ones, our previous
          courses taught students that information can be represented in a variety
          of binary options.  This lesson takes that concept one step further as it
          illustrates how a computer can store even more complex information (such
          as images and colors) in binary, as well.

          For this session we'll use a tool called "Swipe Right for CS", which has been developed by our partners at MIT. In Swipe Right for CS, you will read through some student profiles and consider specific statements that you might use to convince him or her to enroll in your CS Principles course. \r
          \r
          ### How it Works\r
          When playing the Swipe Right for CS game you will see a series of quotes that you might say to each student. You will swipe right on quotes that you think would be effective in convincing students to enroll in the course and swipe left on statements that you think will not be effective. During the session we will discuss as a group your thoughts on the types of statements that are most effective in getting a student to enroll in CS, and you will have a chance to see how other people in your workshop swiped on each of the arguments. \r

          ## Swipe Right for CS\r
          For this session we'll use a tool called "Swipe Right for CS", which has been developed by our partners at MIT. In Swipe Right for CS, you will read through some student profiles and consider specific statements that you might use to convince him or her to enroll in your CS Principles course. \r
          \r
          ### How it Works\r
          When playing the Swipe Right for CS game you will see a series of quotes that you might say to each student. You will swipe right on quotes that you think would be effective in convincing students to enroll in the course and swipe left on statements that you think will not be effective. During the session we will discuss as a group your thoughts on the types of statements that are most effective in getting a student to enroll in CS, and you will have a chance to see how other people in your workshop swiped on each of the arguments. \r
