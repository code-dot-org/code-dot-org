          description: |
            In this unit, students extend their understanding of the internet and how it functions by building off the concepts learned when sending bits in Unit 1. The unit largely explores the
            structure and design of the internet and the implications of those design decisions including
            the reliability of network communication, the security of data, and personal privacy. Topics
            include the Internet Protocol (IP), DNS, TCP/IP, cryptography and other security and hacking
            concerns.

            is encoded, represented and manipulated. Being able to digitally manipulate
            data, visualize it, and identify patterns, trends and possible meanings
            are important practical skills that computer scientists do every day.
            Understanding where data comes from, having intuitions about what could
            be learned or extracted from it, and being able to use computational tools
            to manipulate data and communicate about it are the primary skills addressed
            in the unit.
