    title: Updated Terms of Service and Privacy Policy
    intro_desc: 'We updated our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, as shown below.
      The changes are effective as of August 24, 2016.  The biggest change: we will
      <i>no longer store email addresses for student accounts on Code Studio.</i>
      This is a big deal for us, and we hope it sets a new standard for student privacy
      in education technology. We''ve sent you a summary of the other changes via
      email.'
    intro_instructions: You'll need to accept these new terms for students under the
      age of 13 in your classroom to have full access to all the latest features in
      Code Studio.  When registering an account for a student under 13, you will be
      asked to confirm that your school has parental consent for the collection of
      the student’s personal information for the use and benefit of the school, including
      educational programs such as Code Studio.
