        function so that it adds to the x value each time it is called. The more you
        add to x, the faster the target will go.
      Big Game Animation 3_instruction: |
        The update-danger function should work just
        like update-target, except that the danger should move from the right side
        over towards the left. Complete update-danger to make the danger fly across
        the screen.
      Big Game Animation 4_instruction: |
        At this point in your game, your danger
        should run across the screen from right to left, and your target should run
        across from left to right. They don't ever come back on screen once they've
        left, but we'll take care of that later. Take a minute to make sure your
        game is working like you want it to, and then click "Finish" to move on.
      Big Game Booleans 1_instruction: |
        When you last worked on your game we got
        our target and danger sprites to fly across the screen, but they never come
        back. Click "Run" to see how your game is currently working, and then click
        finish and we'll work on making those sprites reappear on screen after they've
        left.
      Big Game Booleans 2_instruction: |
        Go to the Functions section of the toolbox
        and complete the safe-left? function so that it returns true if the sprite's
        x coordinate is greater than -50. If you're successful you should see the
        Danger go off the left side and then return on the right side.
      Big Game Booleans 3_instruction: |
        Now that you've got safe-left?, let's fill
        in safe-right? - it should take in a sprite's x coordinate and return true
        if that coordinate is less than 450. Once your safe-right? is complete you
        should see the Target go off the right side of the screen and return on the
        left.
      Big Game Booleans 4_instruction: |
        Complete the onscreen? function so that it
        checks whether both safe-left? and safe-right? are true.
      Big Game Booleans 5_instruction: |
        At this point your Danger should run across
        the screen from right to left, your Target should run across from left to
        right, and they should both return to the opposite side, repeatedly. Take
        a minute to make sure your game is working like you want it to, and then click
        "Finish" to move on.
      Big Game Collision 1 (copy 1)_instruction: |
        When you last worked on your game
        we got our target and danger sprites to fly across the screen, but they never

        finish and we'll work on making those sprites reappear on screen after they've
        left.
      Big Game Collision 1_instruction: |
        At this point you've programmed a video
        game with a moving Target and Danger, both of which return to the screen once
        they've left, and a Player that responds to keyboard input. Click "Run"
        to see how your game is currently working, and then we'll dig into the final
        missing piece - collision detection!
      Big Game Collision 2_instruction: |
        To move the player up and down, we'll need
        to use a conditional block to figure out which key is pressed and respond
        accordingly. Computers read keypresses as numeric key codes - the up arrow
        is 38 and the down arrow is 40. You can lookup other key codes in your student
        workbook. Edit the 'update-player' function so that if moves the player
        up when the up arrow is pressed, or down when the down arrow is pressed.
      Big Game Collision 3_instruction: |
        Use the Distance Formula, so the distance
        function returns the distance between the player's center coordinates (px,
        py) and another sprite's center coordinates (cx, cy).
      Big Game Collision 4_instruction: |
        Complete the collide? function so that it
        returns true if the distance between two points is less than 100 pixels apart.

        times, turning between each iteration?   Notice that the turns in this shape
        add up to 420 degrees, which means that when your artist is done drawing,
        it will be facing a different direction than when you started.  That new direction
        is exactly 60 degrees to the right of where you began.

        If we count by larger numbers,
        we count even higher in the same amount of time. Try making the dog count
        from 10 up to 1000, 10 at a time.
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 4_instruction: |
        Changing the increment can be
        helpful, but we're still counting linearly (each number is the same distance
        from the last) What if I wanted to count exponentially? Without changing the
        settings in this for loop, can you count 1, 4, 9 , 16, 25... (counter squared)?
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 4a_instruction: |-
        Now, let's blend the variables
        from Stage 7 together with your "counter" variable to make some magic happen.   \r
        \r
        In
        this puzzle, Dog will count from 0 to 1000 by "increment".  Set the "increment"
        variable to 10 at the beginning of your code to see what happens.
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 5_instruction: |
        In the last stage we counted the
        square of each number. Try changing "counter ^ 2" to "counter ^ 3" to
        count the cube of each number (1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343…)
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 5a_instruction: |-
        In this puzzle, Dog will be your
        time keeper.\r
        \r
        Dog will count from 0 to 30 by "increment".  The "increment"
        variable will begin with a value of 1.\r
        \r
        Can you make it so that each
        time you click Dog, the increment increases by 2?  Click the forward arrow
        to run the for loop.\r
        \r
        Run the loop a couple of times, clicking Dog before
        each one.
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 6_instruction: |
        You may recall that a prime number
        is any whole number that is only divisible by itself and 1. Use the "is_prime"
        function to speak out only the prime numbers from 1 to 100.
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 6a_instruction: |-
        Dog will still keep time by counting
        with our "for loop" by "increment", but this time, we will add The Wizard
        into the mix.  Can you change the code so that "increment" goes up by two
        each time The Wizard is clicked?\r
        \r
        Watch out!  The Wizard moves quickly!
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 7_instruction: |
        Could you use a for loop to help

      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 7a_instruction: |-
        Now we're getting somewhere!  What
        if we start counting how many times we can click The Wizard before Dog gets
        to 30?  \r
        \r
        Finish adding blocks to The Wizard so that every time he's
        clicked the variable "clicked" increases by one. You can ignore "increment"
        for now.\r
        \r
        Dog will start counting when you click "Run".
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 8_instruction: |-
        Now, help the actors move as they
        count.  \r
        \r
        Dog should move and count by adding 2 (counter + 2) each time.  Cat
        will move and count by multiplying by 2 (counter * 2)  each time. Penguin
        will move and count to the power of 2 (counter ^ 2) each time.  Who will reach
        their flag first?
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 8a_instruction: |-
        To finish our game, we need to
        bring back the "increment" variable!    Let's tie it to the level of the
        game.\r
        \r
        1) Keep track of the number of times The Wizard is clicked.\r
        2)
        If The Wizard is clicked at least 10 times before Dog counts to 30, raise
        "increment" by 1 and start again.\r
        3) If The Wizard does not get clicked
        at least 10 times, the game is over.

      PDAlg Updates Cond_instruction: |
        When you went to PD in the summer, the Conditional
        block that you were introduced to was black and allowed any data type to be
        used. This proved to be confusing, given that every other function we've
        seen always produces the same type of data. To help make conditionals clearer
        and more consistent we've replaced the single black block with a separate
        block for each data type.
      PDAlg Updates Errors_instruction: |
        Run the provided program and use the error
        messages to try and track down the bugs.
      PDAlg Updates Space_instruction: |
        Making use of limited programming space (especially
        on small screens) is challenging with a block based language. To help with
        this we've added a few features. Experiment with this provided code to see
        how the space can be manipulated to deal with larger programs.
      PDK5 Conditionals 1_instruction: |
        Purple flowers may have either 1 or 0 nectar,
        but you don't know which one! Be careful not to collect nectar from a purple
        flower if it doesn't have any. Check if the nectar is equal to 1 by using
        the if block.
      PDK5 Conditionals 2_instruction: "Try this puzzle that uses conditionals and\nloops
        together. Use the \"if\" block to decide when to turn. Hint: you only\nneed
        one more block to complete this puzzle. \n"
      PDK5 Events 1_instruction: "So far all of the programs we've written are executed\nin
        order from top to bottom. In this puzzle, we'll use \"Events\" to respond\nto

        the Octopus. \n"
      PDK5 Functions 1_instruction: |
        Hello. Me zombie artist. Me love drawing! Help
        me draw the square glasses.  Hint:  the bridge between the glasses is 25 pixels
        shorter than the square length.
      PDK5 Functions 2_instruction: |
        Functions let you define new blocks! We've
        moved the blocks to draw a square into a function called "draw a square".
        Can you use the "draw a square" function to create the glasses? The squares
        are 75 pixels apart.
      PDK5 Loops 1_instruction: "Instead of using 5 \"move forward\" blocks, use\nthe
        \"repeat\" block with a \"move forward\" block inside of it. In computer\nscience,
        this is called a \"loop.\" \n"
      PDK5 Loops 3_instruction: |
        Here's another puzzle to practice loops. What happens
        if you use the repeat block to run the code already provided on the workspace
        4 times?

        were added. You should only need to remove some bits.
      Pixelation - Lesson 14 - Fix bit offset_instruction: |
        A single extra bit was
        inserted into the stream of bits that make up the C of the Code.org logo.
        That extra bit bumps all of the other bits down the line which makes the logo
        look messed up. Hunt down the extra bit and remove it to fix the Code.org
        logo.
      Pixelation - Lesson 14 - Fix the error_instruction: |
        Something happened to
        the bits in this image!  Find error and fix it!  Hint: a few extra bits were

        whatever size you want.  Happy pixeling!
      Pixelation - Lesson 15 - Color Free Play_instruction: |
        Requirements: The icon
        must be 16x16 pixels. You must use the Pixelation Widget to encode the bits
        of color information. The image must be encoded with at least 12 bits per
        pixel.
      Pixelation - Lesson 15 - Color Shades 4x4_instruction: |
        We start you out with
        the 4x4 image Maddie created in the video. Your task is to fill a 4x4 grid
        with colors using 12-bits per pixel. Here are the requirements: Row 1 - fill
        with shades of red. Row 2 - shades of green. Row 3 - shades of blue. Row 4
        - shades of gray.
      Pixelation - Lesson 15 - Color Shades_instruction: |
        We start you out with the
        row of shades of red that Maddie created in the video. Experiment with 6-bit
        color by filling in the bottom row of the image with shades of a different
        color. Here is an example with some shades of blue. Try your own color!
      Pixelation - Lesson 15 - Complete 3-bit color_instruction: |
        We start you with
        the 4x2 image Maddie was creating, but we've left out the last two squares.

        them.
      Pixelation 2_instruction: |
        Something happened to the bits in this image!  Find
        error and fix it!
      Pixelation 4x4 Empty_instruction: |
        The width and height are now encoded in
        the pixel data. Can you figure out how to adjust the dimensions?
      Pixelation Bee_instruction: |
        This larger image of a bee encodes color with
        12 bits per pixel, but viewing in hex makes it easier to see the color of
        each pixel. If you switch to binary mode - hold on to your hat - it's a lot
        of bits. Here's another mind-blowing thing to try: slide the bits per pixel
        up to 24 bits per pixel. What happens? Can you explain this behavior?
      Pixelation Flappy_instruction: |
        Here is a bigger image at 9 bits per pixel.
        With 9 bits per pixel you can express 512 different colors. Click through
        to see the next image which is even more sophisticated, but easier to understand.

      Sam the Butterfly 2_instruction: |
        Sam's mom wants to make sure that she can
        always see at least a bit of him, so lets write some functions that help make
        sure he doesn't go too far out of the yard. Here's a function called safe-left?
        - it should take a Number for its domain that represents Sam's x-coordinates
        and return true if he's completely visible on screen. If your function works,
        Sam shouldn't be able to leave the yard from the left side.
      Sam the Butterfly 3_instruction: |
        In the last puzzle we kept Sam from leaving
        on the left, now let's do the same thing on the right. Complete the safe-right?

      Sam the Butterfly 4_instruction: |
        Huh, we can keep Sam from leaving on the
        left, or we can keep him from leaving on the right, but how can we keep him
        safe from leaving both directions? Try using the and block to program the
        function on-screen? to check if Sam is safe-left? and safe-right?
      Sam the Butterfly 5_instruction: |
        Free Play: Awesome, we've kept Sam safe
        on the left and right! Use this free play stage to experiment with your functions
        and further improve onscreen?
      Sam the Butterfly 6_instruction: |
        We've added a new parameter "y" to the
        "on-screen?" function. Update the function so that it checks that "safe-left?"
        AND "safe-right?" AND "safe-up?" are all true. When you've fixed the
        function, try going out of the yard from the left, right, and top sides.
      Sam the Butterfly 7_instruction: |
        Only one last direction to worry about! Create
        a "safe-down?" function and update the "on-screen?" function so that it
        checks up, down, left, and right.
      Sam the Butterfly Complete_instruction: |

        Let's revisit the 3x3 grid
        problem you did a few lessons ago.  This time the challenge is to program
        the solution "as efficiently as possible."  Now that you know how to write
        functions, it should be easier to break the problem down, and your code should
        be easier to read and debug.  See the rubric for more details about requirements
        and expectations.
