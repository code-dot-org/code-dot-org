                then use isTouching to make one sprite push another across the screen
                before practicing with the four collision blocks (collide, displace,
                bounce, and bounceOff).
              description_teacher: Students program their sprites to interact in new
                ways.  After a brief review of how they used the `isTouching` block,

                The class learns that higher level or more abstract steps make it
                easier to understand and reason about steps, then begins to create
                functions in Game Lab.  At the end of the lesson the class uses these
                skills to organize and add functionality to the final version of their
                side scroller game.

                An unplugged warmup explores how directions at different levels of
                detail can be useful depending on context. Students learn that higher
                level or more abstract steps make it easier to understand and reason
                about steps. Afterwards students learn to create functions in Game
                Lab. They will use functions to remove long blocks of code from their
                draw loop and to replace repeated pieces of code with a single function.
                At the end of the lesson students use these skills to organize and

                use to design games for the remainder of the unit. The class walks
                through through this process in a series of levels. As part of this
                lesson the class also briefly learn to use multi-frame animations
                in Game Lab. At the end of the lesson they have an opportunity to
                make improvements to the game to make it their own.
              description_teacher: This lesson introduces students to the process
                they will use to design games for the remainder of the unit. This
                process is centered around a project guide which asks students to
                define their sprites, variables, and functions before they begin programming
                their game. In this lesson students begin by playing a game on Game
                Lab where the code is hidden. They discuss what they think the sprites,
                variables, and functions would need to be to make the game. They are
                then given a completed project guide which shows one way to implement
                the game. Students are then walked through this process through a
                series of levels. As part of this lesson students also briefly learn
                to use multi-frame animations in Game Lab. At the end of the lesson
                students have an opportunity to make improvements to the game to make
                it their own.
            Using the Game Design Process:

              description_student: In this multi-day lesson, the class uses the problem
                solving process from Unit 1 to create a platform jumper game.  After
                looking at a sample game, the class defines what their games will
                look like and uses a structured process to build them.  Finally, the
                class reflects on how the games could be improved, and implements
                those changes.
              description_teacher: In this multi-day lesson, students use the problem

                start by looking at an example of a platform jumper, then define what
                their games will look like.  Next, they use a structured process to
                plan the backgrounds, variables, sprites, and functions they will
                need to implement their game.  After writing the code for the game,
                students will reflect on how the game could be improved, and implement
                those changes.

                boredom and self expression, and to reflect on how they approach those
                problems in their own lives. From there, they will explore how Computer
                Science in general, and programming specifically, plays a role in
                either a specific form of entertainment or as a vehicle for self expression.

                how to draw with shapes and use a tool that introduces how this problem
                is approached in Game Lab. The warm up activity quickly demonstrates
                the challenges of communicating position without some shared reference
                point. In the main activity students explore a Game Lab tool that
                allows students to interactively place shapes on Game Lab's 400 by
                400 grid. They then take turns instructing a partner how to draw a
                hidden image using this tool, accounting for many challenges students
                will encounter when programming in Game Lab. Students optionally create
                their own image to communicate before a debrief discussion.

            Shapes and Randomness:
              name: Shapes and Randomness
              description_student: This lesson extends the drawing skills to include
                width and height and introduces the concept of random number generation.
                The class learns to draw with versions of ellipse() and rect() that
                include width and height parameters and to use the background() block
                to fill the screen with color. At the end of the progression the class
                is introduced to the randomNumber() block and uses the new blocks
                to draw a randomized rainbow snake.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students continue to develop their
                drawing skills. At the beginning of the lesson a teacher-led discussion
                connects expanded block functionality (e.g. different sized shapes)
                with the need for more block inputs, or "parameters". Students learn
                to draw with versions of `ellipse()` and `rect()` that include width
                and height parameters. They also learn to use the `background()` block.
                At the end of the progression students are introduced to the `randomNumber()`
                block. Combining all of these skills students will draw a randomized
                rainbow snake at the end of the lesson.
            Variables:
              name: Променливи
              description_student: This lesson introduces variables as a way to label
                a number in a program or save a randomly generated value. The class
                begins the lesson with a very basic description of the purpose of
                a variable and practices using the new blocks.  Afterwards, the class
                uses variables to save a random number, allowing the programs to use
                the same random number multiple times.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students learn how to use variables
                to label a number in their program or save a randomly generated value.
                Students begin the lesson with a very basic description of the purpose
                of a variable. Students then complete a level progression that reinforces
                the model of a variable as a way to label or name a number. Students
                use variables to save a random number to see that variables actually
                store or save their values, allowing them to use the same random number
                multiple times in their programs.
            Sprites:
              name: Sprites
              description_student: In order to create more interesting and detailed
                images, the class is introduced to the sprite object. Every sprite
                can be assigned an image to show, and sprites also keep track of multiple
                values about themselves, which will prove useful down the road when
                making animations.  At the end of the lesson, everyone creates a scene
                using sprites.

            The Draw Loop:
              name: The Draw Loop
              description_student: This lesson introduces the draw loop, one of the
                core programming paradigms in Game Lab.  The class combines the draw
                loop with random numbers to manipulate some simple animations with
                dots and then with sprites. Afterwards, everyone uses what they learned
                to update the sprite scene from the previous lesson.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students are introduced to the draw
                loop, one of the core programming paradigms in Game Lab. To begin
                the lesson students look at some physical flipbooks to see that having
                many frames with different images creates the impression of motion.
                Students then watch a video explaining how the draw loop in Game Lab
                helps to create this same impression in their programs. Students combine
                the draw loop with random numbers to manipulate some simple animations
                with dots and then with sprites. At the end of the lesson students
                use what they learned to update their sprite scene from the previous
                lesson.
            The Counter Pattern Unplugged:
              name: The Counter Pattern Unplugged
              description_student: This unplugged lesson explores the underlying behavior
                of variables. Using notecards and string to simulate variables within
                a program, the class implements a few short programs. Once comfortable
                with this syntax, the class uses the same process with sprite properties,
                tracking a sprite's progress across the screen.
              description_teacher: Students explore the underlying behavior of variables
                through an unplugged activity. Using notecards and string to simulate
                variables within a program, students implement a few short programs.
                Once comfortable with this syntax, students use the same process with

            Sprite Movement:
              name: Sprite Movement
              description_student: By combining the Draw Loop and the Counter Pattern,
                the class writes programs that move sprites across the screen, as
                well as animate other sprite properties.

                as animate other sprite properties.
            Conditionals:
              name: Conditionals
              description_student: The class starts by using booleans to compare the
                current value of a sprite property with a target value, using that
                comparison to determine when a sprite has reached a point on the screen,
                grown to a given size, or otherwise reached a value using the counter
                pattern. After using booleans directly to investigate the values or
                sprite properties, the class adds conditional if statements to write
                code that responds to those boolean comparisons.

                code that responds to those boolean comparisons.
            Keyboard Input:
              name: Keyboard Input
              description_student: Following the introduction to booleans and if statements
                in the previous lesson, students are introduced to a new block called
                keyDown() which returns a boolean and can be used in conditionals
                statements to move sprites around the screen. By the end of this lesson
                students will have written programs that take keyboard input from
                the user to control sprites on the screen.
              description_teacher: Following the introduction to booleans and _if_
                statements in the previous lesson, students are introduced to a new
                block called `keyDown()` which returns a boolean and can be used in
                conditionals statements to move sprites around the screen. By the
                end of this lesson students will have written programs that take keyboard
                input from the user to control sprites on the screen.
            Other Forms of Input:
              name: Other Forms of Input
              description_student: The class continues to explore ways to use conditional
                statements to take user input. In addition to the simple keyDown()
                command learned yesterday, the class learns about several other keyboard
                input commands as well as ways to take mouse input.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students continue to explore ways
                to use conditional statements to take user input. In addition to the

            Booleans Unplugged:
              name: Booleans Unplugged
              description_student: This lesson introduces boolean values and logic,
                as well as conditional statements. The class starts by playing a simple
                game of Stand Up, Sit Down in which the boolean (true/false) statements
                describe personal properties (hair or eye color, clothing type, age,
                etc). The class then groups objects based on increasingly complex
                boolean statements, then looks at how conditionals can impact the
                flow of a program.
              description_teacher: |-
                In this lesson, students are introduced to boolean values and logic, as well as conditional statements. The class starts by playing a simple game of Stand Up, Sit Down in which the boolean (true/false) statements describe personal properties (hair or eye color, clothing type, age, etc). This gets students thinking about how they can frame a property with multiple potential values (such as age) with a binary question.

                From there students are provided a group of objects with similar, yet varying, physical properties. With a partner they group those objects based on increasingly complex boolean statements, including compound booleans with AND and OR.

                Finally we reveal Conditionals as a tool to make decisions or impact the flow of a program using boolean statements as input.
            Project - Interactive Card:
              name: Project - Interactive Card
              description_student: In this cumulative project for Chapter 1, the class
                plans for and develops an interactive greeting card using all of the
                programming techniques they've learned to this point.

            Project - Design a Game:
              name: Project - Design a Game
              description_student: The class plans and builds original games using
                the project guide from the previous two lessons. Working individually
                or in pairs, the class plans, develops, and gives feedback on the
                games.  After incorporating the peer feedback, the class shares out
                the completed games.
              description_teacher: Students will plan and build their own game using
                the project guide from the previous two lessons to guide their project.
                Working individually or in pairs, students will first decide on the
                type of game they'd like to build, taking as inspiration a set of
                sample games. They will then complete a blank project guide where
                they will describe the game's behavior and scope out the variables,
                sprites, and functions they'll need to build. In Code Studio, a series
                of levels prompts them on a general sequence they can use to implement
                this plan. Partway through the process, students will share their
                projects for peer review and will incorporate feedback as they finish
                their game. At the end of the lesson, students will share their completed
                games with their classmates. This project will span multiple classes
                and can easily take anywhere from 3-5 class periods.

They will solve a word search, arrange seating for a birthday party, and plan a trip. The problems grow increasingly complex and poorly defined to highlight how the problem solving process is particularly helpful when tackling these types of problems. The lesson concludes with students reflecting on their experience with the problem solving process. They will justify the inclusion of each step and will brainstorm questions or strategies that can help them better define open-ended problems, as this is often the most critical step.

                This lesson will likely take two class periods or more to complete. The first two problems may fit into a single class period but the third will need to be moved to a second day.
            What is a Computer?:
              name: What is a Computer?
              description_student: In this lesson the class develops a preliminary
                definition of a computer. After brainstorming the possible definitions
                for a computer, the class works in groups to sort pictures into “is
                a computer” or “is not a computer” on poster paper and explain their
                motivations for choosing some of the most difficult categorizations.  The
                teacher then introduces a definition of the computer and allows groups
                to revise their posters according to the new definition.

              name: Input and Output
              description_student: In this the class students consider a number of
                computing devices to determine what types of inputs and outputs they
                use. Groups are assigned to a computing device and based on a teacher-provided
                definition of input and output, list the inputs and outputs of their
                device.  To conclude the lesson the class examines common activities
                they do on a computing device and select the inputs and outputs used
                for that activity from the chart.

                device. Earlier in the activity students are prompted to focus on
                more obvious physical inputs and outputs (e.g. a keyboard as an input
                or a screen as an output) but later discussions lead students to consider
                less obvious examples (e.g. that a touch screen is both an input and
                output, or the fact that the Internet can serve as both input and
                output). Throughout the lesson the teacher records inputs and outputs
                that are identified on a T-Chart at the front of the room. To conclude
                the lesson students examine common activities they do on a computing
                device and select the inputs and outputs used for that activity from

            Processing:
              name: Processing
              description_student: This lesson dives deeper into the concept of processing
                that was introduced as part of the definition of a computer.  Pairs
                work together to puta deck of cards in order, a form of processing
                information.  In the end, the class discusses what processing means
                within the context of solving information problems.
              description_teacher: Students complete two unplugged card sorting activities
                to explore the meaning of processing and its relationship to problem-solving.
                The first has few constraints and is used to introduce a high-level
                definition of processing. The next introduces more constraints that
                forces students to develop an algorithm that will always successfully
                process the cards. Students iteratively develop, test, and share their
                algorithms with classmates. A wrap-up discussion has students reflect
                on the different types of problem-solving they used in these activities
                and the value of producing an algorithm to solve a problem.
            Storage:
              name: Storage
              description_student: This lesson focuses on the storage component of
                the definition of a computer, within the content of processing information.
                The class spends the majority of the lesson developing and sharing
                algorithms to process information, with an emphasis on how much storage
                is needed for any particular algorithm. The lesson concludes with
                a discussion of the importance of storage while processing information.
              description_teacher: Students explore the importance of storage within
                the Input-Storage-Processing-Output model of a computer. The warm-up
                activity asks students to reflect on the types of information they
                have seen computers store in the past, like documents, photographs,
                or videos. The unplugged main activity has students develop an algorithm
                to process a small pile of cards in search of specific cards within
                the deck. Constraints on how students can move the cards force them
                to consider the importance of storage even while they are processing
                the deck. The lesson concludes with a discussion of the two types
                of storage students saw in this lesson and the importance of storage
                while processing information.

                and the input/output/store/process model of a computer, the class
                proposes apps designed to solve real world problems. This project
                is completed across multiple days and culminates in a poster presentation
                highlighting the features of each app. The project is designed to
                be completed in pairs though it can be completed individually.

                sample social media pages to see what types of personal information
                could be shared intentionally or unintentionally.  Finally, the class
                comes up with a set of guidelines to follow when putting information
                online.
              description_teacher: "As students have recently spent some time thinking
                about the actual content that will go into their personal website,
                this lesson takes a step back from the unit-long project (publication
                of a personal website) to help students articulate what personal information
                they choose to share digitally and with whom.  It also reinforces
                the notion that much of the information that they choose to share
                digitally falls largely out of their control the moment it is released.
                \ \r\n\r\nStudents begin by individually identifying appropriate audiences
                with whom they would be comfortable sharing given pieces of personal
                information.  They then look at several social media pages to determine
                what sorts of information people are sharing about themselves or one
                another.  Last, students reflect on what guidelines they think are
                appropriate for posting information online.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate point
                of this lesson is not to scare students, but rather to experientially
                bring students to realizing precisely what level of control they don’t
                have in releasing information into the web."

                and unlikely animals.
              description_teacher: This lesson encourages students to think more critically
                about how web searches work and how to find relevant and trustworthy
                information online. After viewing and discussion a video about how
                search engines work, students will search for information about several
                unlikely animals. They'll need to analyze the sites they find for
                reliability in order to identify which of the animals is actually
                a hoax.

                a handful of the most-used websites in the United States and discusses
                how each of those sites is useful for users and how it might also
                serve its creators.
              description_teacher: Every website has a purpose, a reason someone created
                it and others use it. In this lesson, students will start to consider
                the purposes a website might serve, both for the users and the creators.
                Students will explore a handful of the most-used websites in the United
                States and try to figure out how each of those sites is useful for
                users and how they might also serve their creators.

                websites as a means of personal expression and develop a list of topics
                and interests that they would want to include on a personal website.
                To begin the lesson students brainstorm different ways that people
                express and share their interests and ideas. Students then look at
                a few exemplar websites made by students from a previous CS Discoveries
                course to identify ways they are expressing their ideas. Finally students
                brainstorm and share a list of topics and interests they might want

              description_student: This lesson introduces to HTML as a solution to
                the problem of how to communicate both the content and structure of
                a website to a computer. The lesson begins with a brief unplugged
                activity demonstrating the challenges of effectively communicating
                the structure of a web page. The class looks at an HTML page in Web
                Lab and discusses how HTML tags help solve this problem, then uses
                HTML to write the first web pages of the unit.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students are introduced HTML as
                a solution to the problem of how to communicate both the content and

                page in Web Lab and discuss with their classmates how HTML tags help
                solve this problem. Students then write their first HTML. A wrap-up
                discussion helps to solidify the understanding of content vs. structure
                that was developed throughout the lesson.

                tags, this time with headers.  The class practices using header tags
                to create page and section titles and learns how the different header
                elements are displayed by default.  Next, the class plans how to organize
                their content on the personal web pages that will be built across
                the unit and begins the first page of the project.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students continue to use HTML to
                structure text on web pages, this time with headers.  Students learn
                how the different header elements are displayed by default and practice
                using them to create page and section titles.  Students then start
                to decide how they will organize their content on their own personal
                web pages.  In the last level, students begin the project that they

                their project, where they add a new HTML page.  Inside the new page,
                they write the HTML to display a recipe, top ten list, or any other
                content that uses the new tags that they have learned.
            Intellectual Property and Images:

                video, or music created by others a website while respecting the rights
                of the creator of that media. After first studying Creative Commons
                licensing, the class learns how to add images to web pages, and how
                to give proper attribution when doing so.
              description_teacher: "Starting with an discussion of their personal
                opinions on how others should be allowed to use their work, the class
                explores the purpose and role of copyright for both creators and users
                of creative content.  They then move on to an activity exploring the
                various Creative Commons licenses as a solution to the difficulty
                in dealing with copyright. \r\n\r\nFinally, with a common understanding
                of the restrictions of various Creative Commons licenses, students

            of your users."
          description: Unit 4 introduces the broader social impacts of computing.
            Through a series of design challenges, you will learn how to better understand
            the needs of others while developing a solution to a problem. The second
            half of the unit consists of an iterative team project, during which teams
            have the opportunity to identify a need that they care about, prototype
            solutions both on paper and in App Lab, and test solutions with real users
            to get feedback and drive further iteration.
          stages:
            Analysis of Design:
              name: Analysis of Design
              description_student: The class explores a variety of different teapot
                designs to consider how design choices or made and why. Using the
                teapots as an example, the class will explore the relationship between
                users, their needs, and the design of objects they use.
              description_teacher: To kick off a unit devoted to group problem solving
                and developing products for other users, students begin by investigating
                the design of various teapots. Students analyze each teapot, attempting
                to identify how specific user needs might have informed its design.
                By considering these design choices, and attempting to match each
                teapot with a potential user, students can begin to see how taking
                a user-centered approach to designing products (both physical and
                digital) can make those products more useful and usable. To conclude
                the activity, students are asked to propose some changes to one of
                the teapots that would make it more useful or usable.
            Understanding Your User:
              name: Understanding Your User
              description_student: Using user profiles, the class explores how different
                users might react to a variety of products. Role playing as a different
                person, each member of the class will get to experience designs through
                someone else's eyes.
              description_teacher: "Designers need to understand their users’ needs
                in order to create useful products.  This lesson encourages students
                to think about how to design for another person by role-playing as
                someone else using a user profile and reacting as that user to a series
                of products.  Each student is assigned a user profile describing a
                person, which they then use to choose appropriate products, critique
                product design, and suggest improvements to design.\r\n"

              description_student: In small groups, the class uses the design process
                to come up with ideas for smart clothing. From brainstorming, to identifying
                users, to finally proposing a design, this is the first of several
                opportunities in this unit to practicing designing a solution for
                the needs of others.
              description_teacher: This lesson guides students through an abbreviated
                version of the design process they will be seeing throughout this
                unit. Students first brainstorm a list of potential users of smart
                clothing. As a class, they then group these ideas into broad categories
                and each group will choose one category of user. Groups repeat this
                process to brainstorm needs or concerns of their user, eventually
                categorizing these needs and choosing one to focus on. Finally, students
                design a piece of smart clothing, using the specific needs and concerns
                they brainstormed to guide their decision making. At the end of the
                class students quickly share their decision-making process and get
                feedback on how well their product addresses the user need they selected.

            Designing Apps for Good:
              name: Designing Apps for Good
              description_student: To kick off the app design project, the class organizes
                into teams and starts exploring app topics. Several example socially
                impactful apps serve as inspiration for the project.
              description_teacher: To kick off the app design project that lasts through
                the end of the unit, students first explore a number of apps designed
                for social impact that have been created by other students. The class
                then reviews the Define, Prepare, Try, and Reflect steps of the Problem
                Solving process as they develop an idea for an app of their own with
                social impact. Finally, students will form project teams and lay out
                a contract for how the team will function throughout the development
                of their app.
            Market Research:
              name: Market Research
              description_student: Dive into app development by exploring existing
                apps that may serve similar users. Each group identifies a handful
                of apps that address the same topic they are working on, using those
                apps to help refine the app idea they will pursue.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students research apps similar to
                the one they intend on creating to better understand the needs of
                their users. Students work within their teams to search the Internet
                for other apps, then evaluate the ones they find interesting. By the
                end of the lesson, each team will have a clearer idea about the type
                of app they want to create and further refine who their target users
                are. Each team will maintain a list of citations for all the apps
                they examined for use in their final presentation.
            Paper Prototypes:
              name: Paper Prototypes
              description_student: Paper prototypes allow developers to quickly test
                ideas before investing a lot of time writing code. In this lesson
                teams explore some example apps created in App Lab, using those apps
                to help inform the first paper prototypes of their apps.
              description_teacher: "Before starting to design apps, we need to help
                students to better scope their expectations. Because students will
                eventually be prototyping these apps in App Lab, they will be in better
                shape if their ideas align with the kinds of apps that are easily
                prototyped in App Lab. Teams start this scoping by looking through
                several example apps designed to demonstrate apps that can be created
                with App Lab. Teams then can chose one (or more) of the apps as a
                basis for their own. From there, teams have some time to discuss the
                basic functionality of their app before using 3x5 index cards to develop
                paper prototypes.\r\n"
            Prototype Testing:
              name: Prototype Testing
              description_student: In this lesson teams test out their paper prototypes
                with other members of the class. With one student role playing the
                computer, one narrating, and the rest observing, teams will get immediate
                feedback on their app designs which will inform the next version of
                their app prototypes.
              description_teacher: The primary purpose of developing paper prototypes
                is that they allow for quick testing and iteration before any code
                is written. This lesson is focused on giving teams a chance to test
                their prototypes before moving to App Lab. Teams develop a plan to
                test with users before running prototype tests with multiple other
                students in the class (and potentially outside the class). In order
                to test the prototype with the users, the students will have to assign
                roles in the testing (the “narrator”, the “computer” and the “observers”)
                as well as have some questions prepared for the user to answer after
                the test is complete.
            Digital Design:
              name: Digital Design
              description_student: Having developed, tested, and gathered feedback
                on a paper prototype, teams now move to App Lab to build the next
                iteration of their apps. Using the drag-and-drop Design Mode, each
                team member builds out at least one page of their team's app, responding
                to feedback that was received in the previous round of testing.
              description_teacher: Having collaboratively developed a paper prototype
                for their apps, groups now divide and conquer to begin work on an
                interactive digital version based on the paper prototype. Using the
                drag-and-drop design mode of App Lab, students individually work through
                a progression of skill-building levels to learn how to build digital
                versions of a paper prototype. From there, each group member builds
                out at least one page of their app in App Lab, to be later combined
                into a single app.
            Event Driven Programming:
              name: Event Driven Programming
              description_student: Building on the screens that the class designed
                in the previous lesson, teams combine screens into a single app. Simple
                code can then be added to make button clicks change to the appropriate
                screen.
              description_teacher: In this lesson teams combine the screens that they
                designed in the previous lesson into a single app, which they then
                begin to program using simple events. Students learn basic event driven
                programming by making several small apps that respond to users clicking
                buttons. Following that, group members share the screens they've developed
                and each group member imports all of the screens into their own copy
                of the app, which they will make interactive by connecting buttons
                to events.
            Basic App Functionality:
              name: Basic App Functionality
              description_student: Teams add a bit more polish and functionality to
                their apps before testing. Several examples are provided to demonstrate
                simple code that adds cool features.
              description_teacher: At this point in the development process, each
                student should have what is essentially a digital version of the paper
                prototype - static screens that are linked together with buttons.
                For many apps this is all you really need to start testing with users,
                but this lesson will give students a chance to explore simple ways
                to add a bit more functionality to their apps before moving into the
                testing phase. The programming concepts introduced in this lesson
                are **not necessary** to successfully complete the project, and can
                be omitted at your discretion.
            Testing the App:
              name: Testing the App
              description_student: Teams run another round of user testing, this time
                with their interactive prototype. Feedback gathered from this round
                of testing will inform the final iteration of the app prototypes.
              description_teacher: 'By the end of the previous lesson each team should
                have a minimum viable prototype of their app. The primary purpose
                of this lesson is to have the team actually test the app with other
                people, preferably from the target audience the app is intended for,
                or from different teams in the class while observers from the team
                will record the results on the worksheets they used in the planning
                phase. As with testing the paper prototypes, teams will start by planning
                for the specific scenarios before running and observing tests. '
            Improving and Iterating:
              name: Improving and Iterating
              description_student: Using the feedback from the last round of testing,
                teams implement changes that address the needs of their users. Each
                team tracks and prioritizes the features they want to add and the
                bugs they need to fix.
              description_teacher: Teams have at this point developed an app prototype
                that has gone through multiple iterations and rounds of user testing.
                With the information and guidance gained from the last round of user
                testing, each student has the opportunity to plan for and implement
                improvements to the team app. Depending on the time you have available,
                and student interest, you can run the cycle of testing and iteration
                as many times as you see fit.
            App Presentation:
              name: App Presentation
              description_student: Each team prepares a presentation to "pitch" the
                app they've developed. This is the time to share struggles, triumphs,
                and plans for the future.
              description_teacher: At this point teams have researched a topic of
                personal and social importance, developed and tested both a paper
                prototype and a digital prototype, and iterated on the initial app
                to incorporate new features and bug fixes. Now is the time for them
                to review what they have done and pull together a coherent presentation
                to demonstrate their process of creation. Using the provided presentation
                template, teams prepare to present about their process of app development,
                including the problem they set out to solve, the ways in which they've
                incorporated feedback from testing, and their plans for the future.
            User Interface and Prototype Testing:
              name: User Interface and Prototype Testing
              description_student: See how a paper prototype can be used to test and
                get feedback on software before writing any code. To help out a developer
                with their idea, the class tests and provides an app prototype made
                of paper.
              description_teacher: Following the mini design project, students look
                towards the next phase of design - prototyping a product that attempts
                to address user needs. In teams, students examine a paper prototype
                for a chat app called "Txt Ur Grndkdz". Through using this paper prototype,
                students get a chance to see how a simple paper prototype can be used
                to quickly test ideas and assumptions before we ever get to the computer.
                After "using" the provided prototype students begin to identify ways
                to improve the next iteration.
            Feedback and Prototypes:
              name: Feedback and Prototypes
              description_student: Users have been testing an app, and they have lots
                of feedback for the developer. The class needs to sort through all
                of this feedback, identify the common themes and needs, and start
                revising the prototype to make it better meet the users' needs.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students use feedback from "users"
                of the paper-prototyped app from the previous lesson in order to develop
                improvements to the user interface of that paper prototype. The lesson
                begins with a reflection on the fact that designers need to translate
                human needs with technology into changes to the user interface or
                experience. Students are then given a collection of feedback and requests
                from users of the app from the previous lesson. In groups students
                categorize the feedback and identify ways the needs expressed in the
                feedback could be met by changes to the interface of the app. Then
                in groups students will implement some of these changes to meet one
                of the needs they identified.
            Identifying User Needs:
              name: Identifying User Needs
              description_student: Up to this point the users that the class has considered
                have all been remote, and the only information from users has come
                through text or role playing. Now the class will rely on each other
                as potential users, and pairs will get to interview each other to
                identify needs that could be addressed by developing an app.
              description_teacher: 'Up to this point students have focused on designing
                for users who are, to some degree, distanced from them. Whether through
                brainstorming, profiles, or text feedback, the connection to an end
                user has never been direct. This is distance is designed to help students
                get outside their own head when thinking about users, but in order
                to get information more directly from an actual user, students need
                to rely on their classmates. In this lesson students pair up to become
                users (and designers) for each other, allowing everyone to directly
                interview their end user and ask questions to better inform their
                design. Each student pair interviews each other, attempting to identify
                a specific need that could be addressed by an app. '
            Project - Paper Prototype:
              name: Project - Paper Prototype
              description_student: Using the interview information from the previous
                lesson, the class comes up with app ideas to address the needs of
                their users. To express those ideas, and test out their effectiveness,
                each student creates and tests paper prototypes of their own.
              description_teacher: Based on the peer interview from the previous lesson,
                each student comes up with an idea for an app that will address their
                user's problem. Students then get to create their own paper prototype
                of their app ideas by drawing "screens" on individual notecards. A
                project guide directs students through the process including building
                the app and testing it with their user to see if their assumptions
                about the user interfaces they created are accurate.
            Linking Screens:
              name: Linking Screens
              description_student: Building on the screens that the class designed
                in the previous lesson, teams combine screens into a single app. Simple
                code can then be added to make button clicks change to the appropriate
                screen.
              description_teacher: In this lesson teams combine the screens that they
                designed in the previous lesson into a single app, which they can
                then link together using code. Students learn basic event driven programming
                by building up the model app that they started in the previous lesson.
                In addition to the screen that students designed yesterday, they'll
                learn how to create additional screens and even import screens made
                by others.
            User Interfaces:
              name: User Interfaces
              description_student: See how a paper prototype can be used to test and

          description: Unit 6 explores the role of hardware platforms in computing
            and how different sensors can provide more effective input and output
            than the traditional keyboard, mouse, and monitor. Using App Lab and Adafruit’s
            Circuit Playground, you’ll develop programs that utilize the same hardware
            inputs and outputs that you see in the smart devices, looking at how a
            simple rough prototype can lead to a finished product. The unit concludes
            with a design challenge to use the Circuit Playground as the basis for
            an innovation of your own design.

              description_teacher: To kick off the final unit of this course, students
                will do some research into interesting innovations in computing. This
                lesson will expose students to wider variety of computing form factors
                (what a computer looks like) and fields that are impacted by computing.
                Later in this unit students will look back on the devices they encountered
                in this lesson as they develop their own physical computing devices.
            Input Unplugged:
              name: Input Unplugged
              description_student: Experience two different ways that an app can take
                input from a user, while learning more about the event-driven programming
                model used in App Lab.
              description_teacher: In preparation for delving deeper into programming
                with App Lab, students will explore how a handful of different programs
                written in both Game Lab and App Lab handle taking input from the
                user. After comparing and contrasting the approaches they saw in the
                example apps, students group up to act out the two different models
                for input (conditionals in an infinite loop and asynchronous events)
                to gain a better understanding of how they work.
            Event Types:
              name: Event Types
              description_student: Review the basics of programming in App Lab and
                explore some new event types that can be used in your programs.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students review the material they
                learned about creating apps in App Lab from Unit 4 in order to prepare
                for a return to App Lab in this unit. This review should be modified
                to best meet the needs of your students and their experience and familiarity
                with programming in App Lab. In addition to the review the students
                will also experiment with a variety of new event types that they likely
                have not seen before.
            Getters and Setters:
              name: Getters and Setters
              description_student: By reading and changing the content on the screen
                of an app, the class starts to build apps that only need a single
                screen. Even with just one screen, these techniques allow for lots
                of user interaction and functionality.
              description_teacher: In Unit 4 students learned a very simple approach
                to app development in App Lab that required a separate screen for
                most interactions. To expand the kinds of apps that students can make,
                and to encourage them to think in new ways about how users interact
                with apps, we introduce the concept of "getters" and "setters". These
                are commands which can get and set (or change) the content and properties
                of various design elements. In this lesson students build up simple
                apps that only require a single screen, the content of which is changed
                using getters and setters.
            The Circuit Playground:
              name: The Circuit Playground
              description_student: Get to know the Circuit Playground, the circuit
                board that will be used throughout the rest of this unit. Using App
                Lab, develop programs that use the Circuit Playground for output.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students get their first opportunity
                to write programs that use the Circuit Playground. After first inspecting
                the board visually and hypothesizing possibly functionalities, students
                move online where they will learn to write applications that control
                an LED. By combining App Lab screens with the Circuit Playgrounds,
                students can gradually start to integrate elements of the board as
                an ouput device while relying on App Lab for user input.
            Lists:
              name: Листи
              description_student: Learn how lists can be used to store multiple values
                in a single variable name.
              description_teacher: A list, also commonly known as an array, is a type
                of variable that can store many values at once. In this lesson, students
                learn to create lists which store a series of related values in a
                single variable. After creating lists of their own, students will
                learn about ways to extract either a specific or random value from
                a list using its index.
            Lights:
              name: Lights
              description_student: Using the concept of lists from the previous lesson,
                the class writes programs that control the ten color LEDs on the Circuit
                Playground.
              description_teacher: The Circuit Playground includes 10 color LEDs in
                a ring around the outside edge. These LEDs are accessible in code
                as a list called `colorLeds`. Building on the understanding of lists
                from the previous lesson, students write programs that control the
                color LEDs by accessing them from a list.
            For Loops:
              name: For Loops
              description_student: The class learns about repeating instructions using
                a _for loop_, first by controlling a "robot" through a grid, and then
                in App Lab.
              description_teacher: Students are introduced to the _for loop_ in this
                lesson as a way to repeat some code a certain numbers of times. Students
                start with an unplugged activity where they use for loops to navigate
                a robot across a grid. Once complete, students then take their knowledge
                into App Lab where they write programs that rely on iteration using
                a _for loop_.
            Lists and For Loops:
              name: Lists and For Loops
              description_student: Combining _lists_ and _for loops_ allows you to
                write code that impacts every element of a list, regardless of how
                long it is. The class uses this structure to write programs that process
                all of the elements in lists, include the list of color LEDs.
              description_teacher: 'Using a _for loop_ to iterate over all of the
                elements in an array is a really useful construct in most programming
                languages. In this lesson, students combine what they have learned
                about lists and for loops in order to start learning this pattern.
                Students use for loops to go through each element in a list one at
                a time without having to write code for each element. Towards the
                end of the lesson students will apply this with the `colorLed` list
                on the board. '
            Timed Loops:
              name: Timed Loops
              description_student: In this lesson we build on students understanding
                of for loops to learn about a more sophisticated structure called
                a timed loop. Unlike for loops, you can control how quickly a timed
                loop repeats, and other code (such as event handlers) can be run between
                iterations of the loop. This allows us to create interesting animations
                that repeat infinitely, while still allowing other code to run alongside
                it.
              description_teacher: In this lesson we build on students understanding
                of _for loops_ to learn about a more sophisticated structure called

                to run alongside it.
            'Project: Board Output':
              name: 'Project: Board Output'
              description_student: Students take what they've learned through chapter
                one, and develop an app of their own design that uses the board to
                output information.
              description_teacher: Students take what they've learned through chapter
                one, and develop an app of their own design that uses the board to
                output information.
            Physical Input:
              name: Physical Input
              description_student: Using the hardware buttons and switch, the class
                develops programs that use the Circuit Playground as an input.
              description_teacher: This lesson transitions students from consider
                the Circuit Playground as strictly an output device towards using
                it as a tool for both input and output. Starting with the hardware
                buttons and switch,sing the hardware buttons and switch, students
                learn to use `onBoardEvent()`, analogously to `onEvent()`, in order
                to take input from their Circuit Playgrounds.
            Analog Input:
              name: Analog Input
              description_student: Explore the analog inputs on the Circuit Playground,
                writing programs that respond to the environment through sensors.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students explore how the three
                analog sensors (sound, light, and temperature) can be used to write
                programs that respond to changes in the environment. The use of these
                sensors marks a transition in terms of how users interact with a program.
                By using sensors as an input, the user of an app doesn't have to directly
                interact with it at all, or may interact without actually realizing
                they are doing so.
            Sensor Applications:
              name: Sensor Applications
              description_student: Work through three small apps to better understand
                the uses of the sensors from the previous lesson.
              description_teacher: To follow up on the sensors that students learned
                about in the previous lesson, we walk through a three apps, each of
                which relies on a different sensor. These three apps can serve as
                jumping off points for students in the final project that follows.
            'Project: Prototype an Innovation':
              name: 'Project: Prototype an Innovation'
              description_student: Develop innovative computing devices of your own
                design, using everything you've learned throughout this course.
              description_teacher: 'In this final project for the course, students
                team to develop and test a prototype for an innovative computing device
                based on the Circuit Playground. Using the inputs and outputs available
                on the board, groups will create programs that allow for interesting
                and unique user interactions. '
            Designing Screens with Code:
              name: Designing Screens with Code
              description_student: By reading and changing the content on the screen
                of an app, the class starts to build apps that only need a single
                screen. Even with just one screen, these techniques allow for lots
                of user interaction and functionality.

                most interactions. To expand the kinds of apps that students can make,
                and to encourage them to think in new ways about how users interact
                with apps, we introduce the `setProperty()` block. This command can
                be used to set the content and properties of various UI elements,
                allowing students to write programs that update information on a single
                screen, instead of manually creating duplicate screens. In this lesson
                students build up simple apps that only require a single screen, the
                content of which is changed using `setProperty()`.
            Board Events:
              name: Board Events
              description_student: Using the hardware buttons and switch, the class
                develops programs that use the Circuit Playground as an input.
              description_teacher: This lesson transitions students from consider
                the Circuit Playground as strictly an output device towards using
                it as a tool for both input and output. Starting with the hardware
                buttons and switch,sing the hardware buttons and switch, students
                learn to use `onBoardEvent()`, analogously to `onEvent()`, in order
                to take input from their Circuit Playgrounds.
            Getting Properties:
              name: Getting Properties
              description_student: This lesson introduces students to the getProperty
                block, which allows them to access the properties of different elements
                with code.  Students first practice using the block to determine what
                the user has input in various user interface elements. Students later
                use getProperty and setProperty together with the counter patters
                to make elements move across the screen.  A new screen element, the
                slider, and a new event trigger, onChange, are also introduced.
              description_teacher: This lesson introduces students to the `getProperty`
                block, which allows them to access the properties of different elements
                with code.  Students first practice using the block to determine what
                the user has input in various user interface elements. Students later

                slider, and a new event trigger, `onChange`, are also introduced.
            The Program Design Process:
              name: The Program Design Process
              description_student: This lesson introduces students to the process
                they will use to design programs of their own throughout this unit.
                This process is centered around a project guide which asks students
                to sketch out their screens, identify elements of the Circuit Playground
                to be used, define variables, and describe events before they begin
                programming. This process is similar to the Game Design Process that
                we used in Unit 3. In this lesson students begin by playing a tug
                o' war style game where the code is hidden. They discuss what they
                think the board components, events, and variables would need to be
                to make the program. They are then given a completed project guide
                which shows one way to implement the project. Students are then walked
                through this process through a series of levels. At the end of the
                lesson students have an opportunity to make improvements to the program
                to make it their own.

            'Project: Make a Game':
              name: 'Project: Make a Game'
              description_student: Students take what they've learned through chapter
                one, and develop an app of their own design that uses the board to
                output information.

            Arrays:
              name: Arrays
              description_student: Learn how lists can be used to store multiple values
                in a single variable name.
              description_teacher: An array is an ordered collection of items, usually
                of the same type. In this lesson, students learn ways to access either
                a specific or random value from a list using its index.  They then
                learn how to access the colorLEDs array that controls the behavior
                of the color LEDs on the Circuit Playground.  Students will control
                the color and intensity of each LED, then use what they have learned
                to program light patterns to create a light show on their Circuit
                Playground.
            Making Music:
              name: Making Music
              description_student: In this lesson students will use the buzzer to
                its full extent by producing sounds, notes, and songs with the buzzer.
                Students start with a short review of the buzzer's frequency and duration
                parameters, then move on to the concept of notes.  Notes allow students
                to constrain themselves to frequencies that are used in Western music
                and provide a layer of abstraction that helps them to understand which
                frequencies might sound good together.  Onces students are able to
                play notes on the buzzer, they use arrays to hold and play sequences
                of notes, forming simple songs.

            Arrays and For Loops:
              name: Arrays and For Loops
              description_student: Combining _lists_ and _for loops_ allows you to
                write code that impacts every element of a list, regardless of how
                long it is. The class uses this structure to write programs that process
                all of the elements in lists, include the list of color LEDs.
              description_teacher: Using a _for loop_ to iterate over all of the elements
                in an array is a really useful construct in most programming languages.
                In this lesson, students learn the basics of how a _for loop_ can
                be used to repeat code, and then combine it with what they've already
                learned about arrays to write programs that process all elements in
                an array. Students use for loops to go through each element in a list
                one at a time without having to write code for each element. Towards
                the end of the lesson students will apply this with the `colorLed`
                list on the board to create an app that changes all of the LEDs each
                time a button is clicked.
            Accelerometer:
              name: Accelerometer
              description_student: In this lesson, students will explore the accelerometer
                and its capabilities. They’ll become familiar with its events and
                properties, as well as create multiple programs utilizing the accelerometer
                similar to those they’ve likely come across in real world applications.

              description_student: The lesson starts with a quick review of parameters,
                in the context of App Lab blocks that they students have seen recently.  Students
                then look at examples of parameters within user-created functions
                in App Lab and create and call functions with parameters for themselves,
                using them to control multiple elements on a screen.  Afterwards,
                students use for loops to iterate over an array, passing each element
                into a function.  Last, students use what they have learned to create
                a star catching game.

                guide, students will learn how to wire a couple of simple circuits
                and to build prototypes that can communicate the intended design of
                a product, using cheap and easily found materials such as cardboard
                and duct tape.

          description_short: Learn how people use computers to solve data problems.
          description: Unit 5 is about the importance of data in solving problems
            and highlights how computers can help in this process. The first chapter
            explores different systems used to represent information in a computer
            and the challenges and tradeoffs posed by using them. In the second chapter
            you’ll learn how collections of data are used to solve problems, and how
            computers help to automate the steps of this process. The chapter concludes
            by considering how the data problem solving process can be applied to
            an area of your choosing.
          stages:
            Representation Matters:
              name: Representation Matters
              description_student: This first lesson provides an overview of what
                data is and how it is used to solve problems.  Groups use a data set
                to make a series of meal recommendations for people with various criteria.   Afterwards,
                groups compare their responses and discuss how the different representations
                of the meal data affected how the students were able to solve the
                different problems.
              description_teacher: In the first lesson of the data unit, students
                get an overview of what data is and how it is used to solve problems.  Students
                start off with a brief discussion to come to a common understanding
                of data.  They then split into groups and use a data set to make a
                series of meal recommendations for people with various criteria.  Each
                group has the choices of meal represented in a different way (pictures,
                recipes, menu, nutrition) that gives an advantage for one of the recommendations.  Afterwards,
                groups compare their responses and discuss how the different representations
                of the meal data affected how the students were able to solve the
                different problems.
            Patterns and Representation:
              name: Patterns and Representation
              description_student: This lesson looks closer at what is needed to create
                a system of representation.  Groups create systems that can represent
                any letter in the alphabet using only a single stack of cards, then
                create messages with their systems and exchange with other groups
                to ensure the system worked as intended.   The class discusses commonalities
                between working systems while recognizing that there are many possible
                working solutions.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students create their own system
                for representing information. They begin by brainstorming all the
                different systems they already use to represent yes-no responses.
                They then work in small groups to create a system that can represent
                any letter in the alphabet using only a single stack of cards. The
                cards used have one of 6 different possible drawings (6 animals, 6
                colors, etc.) and so to represent the entire alphabet students will
                need to use patterns of multiple cards to represent each letter. Students
                create messages with their systems and exchange with other groups
                to ensure the system worked as intended. In the wrap-up discussion
                the class  reviews any pros and cons of the different systems. They
                discuss commonalities between working systems and recognize that there
                are many possible solutions to this problem and what's important is
                that everyone use the same arbitrary system to communicate.
            ASCII and Binary Representation:
              name: ASCII and Binary Representation
              description_student: This lesson introduces a formal binary system for
                encoding information, the ASCII system for representing letters and
                other characters. At the beginning of the lesson the teacher introduces
                the fact that computers must represent information using either "on"
                or "off". The class is then introduced to the ASCII system for representing
                text using binary symbols and practices using this system before encoding
                their own messages using ASCII.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students learn to use their first
                binary system for encoding information, the ASCII system for representing
                letters and other characters. At the beginning of the lesson the teacher
                introduces the fact that computers must represent information using
                either "on" or "off". Then students are introduced to the ASCII system
                for representing text using binary symbols. Students practice using
                this system before encoding their own message using ASCII. At the
                end of the lesson a debrief conversation helps synthesize the key
                learning objectives of the activity.
            Representing Images:
              name: Representing Images
              description_student: This lesson continues the study of binary representation
                systems, this time with images. The class is introduced to the concept
                of splitting images into squares or "pixels" which can then be turned
                on or off individually to make the entire image. After doing a short
                set of challenges using the Pixelation Widget, the class makes connections
                between the system for representing images and the system for representing
                text they learned in the previous lesson.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students learn how computers represent
                images. To begin the lesson they consider the challenge of turning
                all the complexity of vision into a binary pattern. Through a series
                of images showing how this transformation is made students are introduced
                to the concept of splitting images into squares or "pixels" which
                can then be turned on or off individually to make the entire image.
                Students then do a short set of challenges using the Pixelation Widget
                in order to draw black and white images. Puzzles are designed to call
                out some of the challenges of representing images in this way. In
                the wrap up students make connections between the system for representing
                images and the system for representing text they learned in the previous
                lesson.

            Combining Representations:
              name: Combining Representations
              description_student: This lesson combines all three types of binary
                representation systems (ASCII characters, binary number, and images)
                to allow for the encode of more complex types information in a record.  After
                seeing a series of bits and being asked to decode them, the class
                is introduced to the idea that  understanding binary information requires
                understanding both the system that is being used and the meaning of
                the information encoded.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students use all three types of
                binary representation systems (ASCII characters, binary number, and
                images) to decode information in a record.  After seeing a series
                of bits and being asked to decode them, students are introduced to
                the idea that in order to understand binary information, they must
                understand both the system that is being used and the meaning of the
                information encoded.  They then decode a record representing a pet
                based on a given structure.
            Project - Create a Representation:
              name: Project - Create a Representation
              description_student: The class designs structure to represent their
                perfect day using the binary representation systems they've learned
                in this chapter. After deciding which pieces of information the record
                should capture, the class will decide how a punch card of bytes of
                information will be interpreted to represent those pieces of information.
                Afterwards, everyone will use the ASCII, binary number, and image
                formats they have learned to represent their perfect days try to decipher
                what a partner's perfect day is like.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students design a structure to represent
                their perfect day using the binary representation systems they've
                learned in this chapter. Students will first write a short description
                of their perfect day and then review with a partner to identify the
                key pieces of information they think a computer could capture. As
                a class students will decide how a punch card of bytes of information
                will be interpreted to represent those pieces of information. Students
                will then use the ASCII, binary number, and image formats they have
                learned to represent their perfect days. Students then trade punch
                cards and try to decipher what the other student's perfect day is
                like. The lesson ends with a reflection.
            Problem Solving and Data:
              name: Problem Solving and Data
              description_student: This lesson covers how the problem solving process
                can be tailored to deal with data problems, in particular.  The class
                is tasked with deciding what a city most needs to spend resources
                on.  They must find and use data from the Internet to support their
                decision.
              description_teacher: 'In this lesson, students use the problem solving
                process from earlier in the course to solve a data problem.  After
                reviewing the process, the class is presented with a decision: whether
                a city should build a library, pet shelter, or fire department.  Students
                work in teams to collect information on the Internet to help them
                decide what should be built, then use this information build an argument
                that will convince the city council of their choice.  They then map
                what they have done to the problem solving process that they have
                been using throughout the course, comparing the general problem solving
                process to its specific application to data problems.'
            Making Decisions with Data:
              name: Making Decisions with Data
              description_student: This lesson gives the class a chance to practice
                the data problem solving process introduced in the last lesson.  Not
                all questions have right answers and in some cases the class can and
                should decide that they should collect more data. The lesson concludes
                with a discussion of how different people could draw different conclusions
                from the same data, or how collecting different data might have affected
                the decisions they made.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students get practice making decisions
                with data based on some problems designed to be familiar to middle
                school students. Students work in groups discussing how they would
                use the data presented to make a decision before the class discusses
                their final choices. Not all questions have right answers and in some
                cases students can and should decide that they should collect more
                data. The lesson concludes with a discussion of how different people
                could draw different conclusions from the same data, or how collecting
                different data might have affected the decisions they made.
            Interpreting Data:
              name: Interpreting Data
              description_student: Students begin the lesson by looking at a cake
                preference survey that allows respondents to specify both a cake and
                an icing flavor.  They discuss how knowing the relationship between
                cake and icing preference helps them better decide which combination
                to recommend.  They are then introduced to cross tabulation, which
                allows them to graph relationships to different preferences.  They
                use this technique to find relationships in a preference survey, then
                brainstorm the different types of problems that this process could
                help solve.

            Automating Data Decisions:
              name: Automating Data Decisions
              description_student: In this lesson students look at a simple example
                of how a computer could be used to complete the decision making step
                of the data problem solving process. Students are given the task of
                creating an algorithm that could suggest a vacation spot.  Students
                then create rules, or an algorithm, that a computer could use to make
                this decision automatically. Students share their rules and what choices
                their rules would make with the class data. They then use their rules
                on data from their classmates to test whether their rules would make
                the same decision that  a person would. The lesson concludes with
                a discussion about the benefits and drawbacks of using computers to
                automate the data problem solving process.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students look at a simple example
                of how a computer could be used to complete the decision making step
                of the data problem solving process. Students are given the task of
                creating an algorithm that could suggest a vacation spot.  Students
                then create rules, or an algorithm, that a computer could use to make
                this decision automatically. Students share their rules and what choices
                their rules would make with the class data. They then use their rules
                on data from their classmates to test whether their rules would make
                the same decision that  a person would. The lesson concludes with
                a discussion about the benefits and drawbacks of using computers to
                automate the data problem solving process.
            Problem Solving with Big Data:
              name: Problem Solving with Big Data
              description_student: This lesson covers how data is collected and used
                by a organizations to solve problems in the real world. The class
                looks at three scenarios that could be solved using data and brainstorms
                the types of data they would want to solve them and how they could
                collect the data.  Each scenario also includes a video about a real-world
                service that has solved a similar problem with data.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students look at how data is collected
                and used by organizations to solve problems in the real world. The
                lesson begins with a quick review of the data problem solving process
                they  explored in the last lesson. Then students are presented three
                scenarios that could be solved using data and brainstorm the types
                of data they would want to solve them and how they could collect the
                data. Each problem is designed to reflect a real-world service that
                exists. After brainstorming, students watch a video about a real-world
                service and record notes about what data is collected by the real-world
                service and how it is used. At the end of the lesson, students record
                whether data was provided actively by a user, was recorded passively,
                or is collected by sensors.
            Project - Solve a Data Problem:
              name: Project - Solve a Data Problem
              description_student: To conclude this unit the class designs ways to
                use data to make a recommendations or predictions to help solve a
                problem.  In the first several steps the class brainstorms problems,
                performs simple research, and defines a problem of their choosing.
                They then decide what kind of data they want to collect, how it could
                be collected, and how it could be used, before exchanging feedback
                and giving a final presentation.
              description_teacher: To conclude this unit, students design a recommendation
                engine based on data that they collect and analyze from their classmates.
                After looking at an example of a recommendation app, students follow
                a project guide to complete this multi-day activity. In the first
                several steps, students choose what choice they want to help the user
                to make, what data they need to give the recommendation, create a
                survey, and collect information about their classmates' choices. They
                then interpret the data and use what they have learned to create the
                recommendation algorithm.  Last, they use their algorithms to make
                recommendations to a few classmates. Students perform a peer review
                and make any necessary updates to their projects before preparing
                a presentation to the class.
            Representing Numbers:
              name: Representing Numbers
              description_student: This lesson introduces the binary number system.  With
                a set of cards that represent the place values in a binary (base-2)
                number system, the class turns bits "on" or "off" by turning cards
                face up and face down, then observes the numbers that result from
                these different patterns.  Eventually, the pattern is extended to
                a generic 4-bit system.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students learn about the binary
                number system.  With a set of cards that represent the place values
                in a binary (base-2) number system by a collection of dots, students
                turn bits "on" or "off" by turning cards face up and face down, then
                observe the numbers that result from these different patterns.  Eventually,
                students extend the pattern to a generic 4-bit system.
            8-bit Numbers:
              name: 8-bit Numbers
              description_student: Students review the concept of binary numbers,
                and discuss that they need to know the bit-length of each number in
                order to decode a series of bits.  They then made a flippy-do, a paper
                manipulative that will help them to encode and decode 8-bit numbers
                (0-255).  After practicing with the flippy-do, students discuss how
                they could extend that standardization to the other types of data.

            Encryption:
              name: Encryption
              description_student: Students have a discussion on the different levels
                of security they would like for personal data.  Once the class has
                developed an understanding of the importance of privacy, they learn
                about the process of encrypting information by enciphering a note
                for a partner and deciphering the partner's note.  The class concludes
                with a discussion about the importance of both physical and digital
                security.

            Structuring Data:
              name: Structuring Data
              description_student: This lesson goes further into the interpretation
                of data, including cleaning and visualizing raw data sets.  The class
                first looks at the how presenting data in different ways can help
                people to understand it better.  After seeing how cleaning and visualization
                can help people make better decisions, the class looks at what parts
                of this process can be automated, and what need a human.

                and interpretation of data, including cleaning and visualizing data.  Students
                first look at the how presenting data in different ways can help people
                to understand it better, and they then create visualizations of their
                own data. Using a the results of a preferred pizza topping survey,
                students must decide what to do with data that does not easily fit
                into the visualization scheme that they have chosen.  Finally, students
                look at which parts of this process can be automated by a computer
                and which need a human to make decisions.
            Keeping Data Secret:

                a question or working on a project, it’s so easy for them to get frustrated
                and give up.  This lesson will introduce students to the idea that
                frustration can be an important part of learning. Here, frustration
                is presented as a step in the creative process, rather than a sign
                of failure.\r\n\r\nThis lession can be done over one or two class

              description_teacher: The bridge from algorithms to programming can be
                a short one if students understand the difference between planning
                out a sequence and encoding that sequence into the appropriate language.  This
                activity will help students gain experience reading and writing in

                an introduction (or review depending on the experience of your class)
                of Code.org''s online workspace. There will be videos pointing out
                the basic functionality of the workspace including the `Run`, `Reset`,
                and `Step` buttons. Also discussed in these videos: dragging Blockly
                blocks, deleting Blockly blocks, and connecting Blockly blocks. Next,
                students will practice their _sequencing_ and _debugging_ skills in
                maze. From there, students will see new types of puzzles like Collector,

                students will begin to understand what coding is really about. The
                class will begin by having students instruct each other to color squares
                on graph paper in an effort to reproduce an existing picture. If there’s

                events are, and how computers use them in programs like video games.
                Students will work through puzzles making the program react to events
                (like arrow buttons being pressed.) At the end of the puzzle, students
                will have the opportunity to customize their game with different speeds

                opportunity to push their understanding of loops to a whole new level.
                Playing with the Bee and Plants vs Zombies, students will learn how
                to program a loop to be inside of another loop. They will also be
                encouraged to figure out how little changes in either loop will affect
                their program when they click `Run`.

                repeat commands while a condition is met. While loops are used when
                the programmer doesn't know the exact number of times commands need
                to be repeated, but does know what condition needs to be true in order
                for the loop to continue repeating. For example, students will be
                working to fill holes and dig dirt in Farmer. They will not know the
                size of the holes or the height of the mountains of dirt, but the
                students will know they need to keep filling the holes and digging
                the dirt as long as the ground is not flat."
            Conditionals with Cards:
              name: 'If/Else: Conditionals with Cards'
              description_student: It's time to play a game where you earn points
                only under certain conditions!
              description_teacher: "This lesson demonstrates how conditionals can
                be used to tailor a program to specific information. We don’t always
                have all of the information we need when writing a program. Sometimes
                you will want to do something different in one situation than in another,
                even if you don't know what situation will be true when your code
                runs. That is where conditionals come in. Conditionals allow a computer
                to make a decision, based on the information that is true any time
                your code is run.\n\n"
            Conditionals in Bee:
              name: Conditionals in Bee
              description_student: 'Now that you understand conditionals, it''s time
                to program Bee to use them when collecting honey and nectar. '
              description_teacher: Up until this point students have been writing
                code that executes exactly the same way each time it is run - reliable,
                but not very flexible. In this lesson, your class will begin to code
                with conditionals, allowing them to write code that functions differently
                depending on the specific conditions the program encounters.
            Conditionals & Loops in Maze:
              name: Conditionals & Loops in Maze
              description_student: You can do some amazing things when you use conditionals
                and loops together!
              description_teacher: 'In this lesson, students will be pairing together
                two key concepts: loops and conditionals. This set of puzzles bridges
                the gaps in understanding that occur when working on puzzles that
                use multiple kinds of blocks. By bringing two ideas together, students
                will create more complex code that shows both impressive creativity
                and critical thinking!'
            Conditionals & Loops in Farmer:
              name: Conditionals & Loops in Harvester
              description_student: It's not always clear when to use each conditional.  This
                lesson will help you get practice deciding what to do.
              description_teacher: Students will practice `while` loops, `until` loops,
                and `if / else` statements. All of these blocks use conditionals.
                By practicing all three, students will learn to write complex and
                flexible code.
            Digital Citizenship:
              name: 'Digital Citizenship: Practicing Digital Citizenship'
              description_student: Some information is not safe to share online. This
                lesson will help you learn the difference between safe and private
                information.
              description_teacher: |-
                In collaboration with Common Sense Education, this lesson helps students learn to think critically about the user information that some websites request or require. Students learn the difference between private information and personal information, distinguishing what is safe and unsafe to share online.

                Students will also explore what it means to be responsible and respectful to their offline and online communities as a step toward learning how to be good digital citizens.
            Build a Play Lab Game:
              name: Build a Play Lab Game
              description_student: This lesson will guide you through making your
                very own video game.
              description_teacher: In this online activity, students will have the
                opportunity to learn how to use events in Play Lab and to apply all
                of the coding skills they've learned to create an animated game. It's
                time to get creative and make a game in Play Lab!
            'Unplugged: Binary':
              name: 'Beyond Programming: Binary Images'
              description_student: 'Learn how computers store pictures using simple
                ideas like on and off. '
              description_teacher: Though many people think of binary as strictly
                zeros and ones, students will be introduced to the idea that information
                can be represented in a variety of binary options. This lesson takes
                that concept one step further as it illustrates how a computer can
                store even more complex information (such as images and colors) in
                binary, as well.
            Artist Binary:
              name: Binary in Artist
              description_student: Direct your own artist to create a binary image
                using only commands to turn pixels on and off.
              description_teacher: Binary is extremely important in the world of computers.
                The majority of computers today store all sorts of information in
                binary form. This lesson helps demonstrate how it is possible to take
                something from real life and translate it into a series of ons and
                offs. Students will build binary images in Artist by translating 0s
                and 1s to offs and ons (or blacks and whites).
            Nested Loops Project in Artist:
              name: Nested Loops in Frozen
              description_student: More nested loops! This time, you get to make some
                AMAZING drawing with nested loops.
              description_teacher: Students will create intricate designs using Artist
                in today's set of puzzles. By continuing to practice nested loops
                with new goals, students will see more uses of loops in general. This
                set of puzzles also offers a lot more potential for creativity with
                an opportunity for students to create their own design at the end
                of the stage.
            Debugging in Collector:
              name: Debugging in Collector
              description_student: Have you ever run into problems while coding? In
                this lesson, you will learn about the secrets of debugging. Debugging
                is the process of finding and fixing problems in your code.
              description_teacher: In this online activity, students will practice
                debugging in the "collector" environment. Students will get to practice
                reading and editing code to fix puzzles with simple algorithms, loops
                and nested loops.

              description_teacher: "The next four lessons provide an opportunity for
                students to put their coding skills to use in a capstone project.
                This project will help individuals gain experience with coding and
                produce an exemplar to share with peers and loved ones. Intended to
                be a multi-lesson or multi-week experience, students will spend time
                exploring brainstorming, learning about the design process, building,
                and presenting their final work. \n\nIn the explore stage, students
                will be able to view pre-built examples of projects in both Artist
                and Play Lab for inspiration. Next, students will learn about the
                design process and how to implement it in their own projects. They
                will then be given the space to create their own project in either
                Artist or Play Lab (this is likely the longest stage of the project).
                Finally, students will be able to present their finished work to their

                Here, you will learn about the design process that you'll use to build
                your own creation.
              description_teacher: Over the course of four lessons, students will
                be building up to programming a project of their own design using
                either Play Lab or Artist as their programming environment. In this
                portion of the project, students will learn about the design process
                and how to implement it in their own projects. The lesson guide for
                all four stages of the process can be found in the first stage of

            'Algorithms: Dice Race':
              name: 'Algorithms: Dice Race'
              description_student: Learn how to describe a game from the computer's
                point of view in this lesson on algorithms.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students will relate the concept
                of algorithms back to real-life activities by playing the Dice Race
                game. The goal here is to start building the skills to translate real-world
                situations to online scenarios and vice versa.
            Conditionals:
              name: Conditionals in Farmer
              description_student: You will get to tell the computer what to do under
                certain conditions in this fun and challenging series.
              description_teacher: This lesson introduces students to `while` loops
                and `if / else` statements. _While loops_ are loops that continue
                to repeat commands as long as a condition is true. While loops are
                used when the programmer doesn't know the exact number of times the
                commands need to be repeated, but the programmer does know what condition
                needs to be true in order for the loop to continue looping. `If /
                Else` statements offer flexibility in programming by running entire
                sections of code only if something is true, otherwise it runs something
                else.
            Private and Personal Information:

                to stay safe too. This lesson teaches you the difference between information
                that is safe to share and information that is private.
              description_teacher: |-
                Developed by Common Sense Education, this lesson is about the difference between information that is safe to share online and information that is not.

                As students visit sites that request information about their identities, they learn to adopt a critical inquiry process that empowers them to protect themselves and their families from identity theft. In this lesson, students learn to think critically about the user information that some websites request or require. They learn the difference between private information and personal information, as well as how to distinguish what is safe or unsafe to share online.
            Build a Star Wars Game:
              name: Build a Star Wars Game

                game in this lesson.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students will practice using events
                to build a game that they can share online. Featuring R2-D2 and other
                Star Wars characters, students will be guided through events, then
                given space to create their own game.
            'Functions: Songwriting':
              name: 'Functions: Songwriting'
              description_student: Even rockstars need programming skills. This lesson
                will teach you about functions using lyrics from songs.
              description_teacher: One of the most magnificent structures in the computer
                science world is the function. Functions (sometimes called procedures)
                are mini programs that you can use over and over inside of your bigger
                program. This lesson will help students intuitively understand why
                combining chunks of code into functions can be such a helpful practice.
            Functions in Artist:
              name: Functions in Artist
              description_student: Make complex drawings more easily with functions!
              description_teacher: Students will be introduced to using functions
                on Code.org. Magnificent images will be created and modified with
                functions in Artist. For more complicated patterns, students will
                learn about nesting functions by calling one function from inside
                another.
            Functions in Bee:
              name: Functions in Bee
              description_student: Don't write too much code to gather all of the
                nectar and honey. Use functions instead!
              description_teacher: In the second round of practice with online functions,
                students will navigate complex paths, collect plenty of nectar, and
                make lots of honey.
            Functions in Farmer:
              name: Functions in Farmer
              description_student: Functions will save you lots of work as you help
                the farmer with her harvest!
              description_teacher: Students have practiced creating impressive designs
                in Artist and navigating mazes in Bee, but today they will use functions
                to harvest crops in Farmer. This lesson will push students to use
                functions in the new ways by combining them with `while` loops and
                `if / else` statements.
            Determine the Concept:
              name: Determine the Concept
              description_student: "We aren't giving away any secrets! \nThis lesson
                could use any of the skills you've learned so far."
              description_teacher: This lesson brings together concepts from the previous
                lessons and gives students a chance to think critically about how
                they would solve each problem, but without telling them which concept
                to apply. Students will review basic algorithms, debugging, `repeat`
                loops, conditionals, `while` loops, and functions.
            Build a Play Lab Game:
              name: Build a Play Lab Game
              description_student: Practice making games to share with your friends
                and family.
              description_teacher: This lesson features Play Lab, a platform where
                students can create their own games and have interactions between
                characters and user input. Students will work with events to create
                keyboard controls. This set of puzzles will also loosely guide students
                through game development, but with freedom to add their own ideas.
            Present Your Project:
              name: Present Your Project
              description_student: Get ready to show off! It's time to present your
                finished project to your peers.
              description_teacher: Over the course of four lessons, students will
                be building up to programming a project of their own design using
                either Play Lab or Artist as their programming environment. Finally,
                students will be able to present their finished work to their peers
                or share with their loved ones with a special link. The lesson guide
                for all four stages of the process can be found in the first stage
                of this project process [here](https://curriculum.code.org/csf/coursee/12/).

              description_student: Ever wondered how information travels across the
                internet? It's not magic! This lesson will teach you the basics of
                how the internet works.
              description_teacher: Even though many people use the internet daily,
                not very many know how it works. In this lesson, students will pretend
                to flow through the internet, all the while learning about connections,
                URLs, IP Addresses, and the DNS.
            Crowdsourcing:
              name: 'Beyond Programming: Crowdsourcing'
              description_student: This lesson will teach you about crowdsourcing,
                the process of building a project with a team.
              description_teacher: In computer science, we face some big, daunting
                problems. Challenges such as finding large prime numbers or sequencing
                DNA are almost impossible to do as an individual. Adding the power
                of others makes these tasks manageable. This lesson will show your

            'Algorithms: Tangrams':
              name: 'Algorithms: Tangrams'
              description_student: Here you will learn about algorithms using puzzles
                called tangrams!
              description_teacher: This lesson shows us something important about
                algorithms. As long as you keep an algorithm simple, there are lots
                of ways to use it. However, if you want to make sure everyone produces
                the same outcome, then your algorithm needs more detail. Students
                will learn the difference between a detailed and general algorithm
                while playing with tangrams.
            Introduction:
              name: Introduction to Online Puzzles
              description_student: This lesson will give you a brief introduction
                to some of the amazing things you will learn in this course!
              description_teacher: 'In this lesson, students will be introduced to
                sequences, loops, and nested loops to prepare them for more complicated
                concepts in the later part of the course. This "ramp up" lesson equalizes
                the playing field between the experts and the beginners in your class. '
            The Power of Words:
              name: 'Digital Citizenship: The Power of Words'
              description_student: Bullying is never okay. This lesson will teach
                you about what is and isn't okay to say online.
              description_teacher: "Students consider that while they are enjoying
                their favorite websites they may encounter messages from other kids
                that can make them feel angry, hurt, sad, or fearful. They explore
                ways to handle cyberbullying and how to respond in the face of upsetting
                language online.\n\nStudents discuss all the ways they use technology
                for communication and explore the similarities and differences between
                in-person and online communication. Students then brainstorm ways
                to respond to cyberbullying. "
            Ice Age Play Lab:
              name: Events in Ice Age
              description_student: Think of your favorite video game. Ever wondered
                how it was made? In these puzzles you will develop a video game of
                your own with friends from Ice Age!
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students are guided through a story
                featuring characters from Ice Age. Students will work with events
                and loops to make characters move on the screen, and will get the
                chance to create their own game or story after the guided levels.
            Envelope Variables:
              name: 'Variables: Envelope Variables'
              description_student: 'Envelopes and variables have something in common:
                both can hold valuable things. Here you will learn what variables
                are and the awesome things they can do.'
              description_teacher: Variables are used as placeholders for values such
                as numbers or words. Variables allow for a lot of freedom in programming.
                Instead of having to type out a phrase many times or remember an obscure
                number, computer scientists can use variables to reference them. This
                lesson helps to explain what variables are and how we can use them
                in many different ways. The idea of variables isn't an easy concept
                to grasp, so we recommend allowing plenty of time for discussion at
                the end of the lesson.
            Variables in Artist:
              name: Variables in Artist
              description_student: Don't forget to bring creativity to class! In these
                puzzles you will be making fantastic drawings using variables.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students will explore the creation
                of repetitive designs using variables in the Artist environment. Students
                will learn how variables can be used to make code easier to write
                and easier to read. After guided puzzles, students will end in a freeplay
                level to show what they have learned and create their own designs.
            Variables in Play Lab:
              name: Variables in Play Lab
              description_student: Soon you will learn about making characters interact
                in a game using variables!
              description_teacher: Students will get further practice with variables
                in this lesson by creating scenes in Play Lab. Students will work
                with user input to set the values of their variables, then get space
                to create their own mini-project with variables.
            For Loop Fun:
              name: 'For Loops: For Loop Fun'
              description_student: You're going to have loads of fun learning about
                `for` loops!
              description_teacher: 'We know that loops allow us to do things over
                and over again, but now we’re going to learn how to use loops that
                have extra structures built right in. These new structures will allow
                students to create code that is more powerful and dynamic. '
            For Loops in Bee:
              name: For Loops in Bee
              description_student: Buzz buzz. In these puzzles you will be guiding
                a bee to nectar and honey using `for` loops!
              description_teacher: Featuring Bee, this lesson focuses on for loops
                and using an incrementing variable to solve more complicated puzzles.
                Students will begin by reviewing loops from previous lessons, then
                walked through using for loops to more effectively solve complicated
                problems.
            For Loops in Artist:
              name: For Loops in Artist
              description_student: Get ready to make your next masterpiece. Here you
                will be using `for` loops to make some jaw-dropping pictures.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students continue to practice for
                loops, this time with Artist. Students will complete puzzles combining
                the ideas of variables, loops, and for loops to create complex designs.
                At the end, they will have a chance to create their own art in a freeplay
                level.
            Songwriting with Parameters:
              name: 'Functions: Songwriting with Parameters'
              description_student: You just might release the next big hit single!
                In this lesson, you will be learning what parameters are and how they
                make some fantastic songs!
              description_teacher: One of the most magnificent structures in the computer
                science world is the function. Functions (sometimes called procedures)
                are mini programs that you can use over and over inside of your bigger
                program. This lesson will help students intuitively understand why
                combining chunks of code into functions is such a helpful practice,
                and how they can use those structures even when chunks of code are
                slightly different.
            Conditionals and Functions in Bee:
              name: Conditionals and Functions in Bee
              description_student: The bee needs your help again! Here you will be
                using functions to get nectar and make honey!
              description_teacher: 'This lesson teaches students how to create simple
                functions using our sophisticated “modal” function editor, preparing
                the way for them to incorporate parameters in future lessons. '
            Functions with Parameters in Artist:
              name: Functions with Parameters in Artist
              description_student: Get your programming fingers ready. In these puzzles
                you will make impressive drawings in Artist using functions with parameters.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students continue working with
                functions with and without parameters. Students will get the chance
                to create their own drawings with and without parameters, before modifying
                functions in a freeplay level.
            Functions with Parameters in Bee:
              name: Functions with Parameters in Bee
              description_student: You've had a little practice using functions with
                parameters. This lesson will continue your practice with Bee!
              description_teacher: This lesson features the bee environment, and continues
                along the concept of functions with parameters from the previous Artist
                stage. Students will practice writing and using functions to follow
                complex paths and collect patterns of nectar and honey.

              description_teacher: "The next five lessons provide an opportunity for
                students to put their coding skills to use in a capstone project.
                This project will help individuals gain experience with coding and
                produce an exemplar to share with peers and loved ones. This is intended
                to be a multi-lesson or multi-week project where students spend time
                brainstorming, learning about the design process, building, and then
                presenting their final work. \n\nIn the explore stage, students will
                be able to view examples of projects in both Artist and Play Lab for
                inspiration. Next, students will learn about the design process and
                how to implement it in their own projects. They will then be given
                the space to create their own project in either Artist or Play Lab
                (this is most likely the longest stage of the project). Students will
                then revise their projects, after testing and extra thought. Finally,

          description_short: Learn how people use computers to solve data problems.
          description: Unit 5 is about the importance of data in solving problems
            and highlights how computers can help in this process. The first chapter
            explores different systems used to represent information in a computer
            and the challenges and tradeoffs posed by using them. In the second chapter
            you’ll learn how collections of data are used to solve problems, and how
            computers help to automate the steps of this process. The chapter concludes
            by considering how the data problem solving process can be applied to
            an area of the your choosing.

                on the screen. Thee lesson covers the basics of sequencing and debugging,
                as well as a few simple commands. At the end of the lesson, the class

                a number in a program or save a randomly generated value. The class
                begins the lesson with a very basic description of the purpose of
                a variable and practices using the new blocks.  Afterwards, the class
                uses variables to save a random number, allowing the programs to use
                the same random number multiple times.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students learn how to use variables

                the model of a variable as a way to label or name a number. Students
                use variables to save a random number to see that variables actually
                store or save their values, allowing them to use the same random number
                multiple times in their programs.

                can be assigned an image to show, and sprites also keep track of multiple
                values about themselves, which will prove useful down the road when
                making animations.  At the end of the lesson, everyone creates a scene
                using sprites.

              description_student: This lesson introduces the draw loop, one of the
                core programming paradigms in Game Lab.  The class combines the draw
                loop with random numbers to manipulate some simple animations with
                dots and then with sprites. Afterwards, everyone uses what they learned
                to update the sprite scene from the previous lesson.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students are introduced to the draw
                loop, one of the core programming paradigms in Game Lab. To begin
                the lesson students look at some physical flipbooks to see that having
                many frames with different images creates the impression of motion.
                Students then watch a video explaining how the draw loop in Game Lab
                helps to create this same impression in their programs. Students combine
                the draw loop with random numbers to manipulate some simple animations
                with dots and then with sprites. At the end of the lesson students
                use what they learned to update their sprite scene from the previous
                lesson.
            The Counter Pattern Unplugged:

              description_student: This unplugged lesson explores the underlying behavior
                of variables. Using notecards and string to simulate variables within
                a program, the class implements a few short programs. Once comfortable
                with this syntax, the class uses the same process with sprite properties,
                tracking a sprite's progress across the screen.

                as animate other sprite properties.
            Booleans Unplugged:
              name: Booleans Unplugged
              description_student: This lesson introduces boolean values and logic,
                as well as conditional statements. The class starts by playing a simple
                game of Stand Up, Sit Down in which the boolean (true/false) statements
                describe personal properties (hair or eye color, clothing type, age,
                etc). The class then groups objects based on increasingly complex
                boolean statements, then looks at how conditionals can impact the
                flow of a program.
              description_teacher: |-
                In this lesson, students are introduced to boolean values and logic, as well as conditional statements. The class starts by playing a simple game of Stand Up, Sit Down in which the boolean (true/false) statements describe personal properties (hair or eye color, clothing type, age, etc). This gets students thinking about how they can frame a property with multiple potential values (such as age) with a binary question.

                From there students are provided a group of objects with similar, yet varying, physical properties. With a partner they group those objects based on increasingly complex boolean statements, including compound booleans with AND and OR.

                Finally we reveal Conditionals as a tool to make decisions or impact the flow of a program using boolean statements as input.
            Conditionals:
              name: Conditionals
              description_student: The class starts by using booleans to compare the
                current value of a sprite property with a target value, using that
                comparison to determine when a sprite has reached a point on the screen,
                grown to a given size, or otherwise reached a value using the counter
                pattern. After using booleans directly to investigate the values or
                sprite properties, the class adds conditional if statements to write
                code that responds to those boolean comparisons.

                sprite properties, students add conditional _if_ statements to write
                code that responds to those boolean comparisons.
            Keyboard Input:
              name: Keyboard Input
              description_student: Following the introduction to booleans and if statements
                in the previous lesson, students are introduced to a new block called
                keyDown() which returns a boolean and can be used in conditionals
                statements to move sprites around the screen. By the end of this lesson
                students will have written programs that take keyboard input from
                the user to control sprites on the screen.
              description_teacher: Following the introduction to booleans and _if_
                statements in the previous lesson, students are introduced to a new
                block called `keyDown()` which returns a boolean and can be used in
                conditionals statements to move sprites around the screen. By the
                end of this lesson students will have written programs that take keyboard
                input from the user to control sprites on the screen.
            Other Forms of Input:
              name: Other Forms of Input
              description_student: The class continues to explore ways to use conditional
                statements to take user input. In addition to the simple keyDown()
                command learned yesterday, the class learns about several other keyboard
                input commands as well as ways to take mouse input.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students continue to explore ways
                to use conditional statements to take user input. In addition to the
                simple `keyDown()` command learned yesterday, students will learn
                about several other keyboard input commands as well as ways to take
                mouse input.
            Project - Interactive Card:
              name: Project - Interactive Card
              description_student: In this cumulative project for Chapter 1, the class
                plans for and develops an interactive greeting card using all of the
                programming techniques they've learned to this point.
              description_teacher: In this cumulative project for Chapter 1, students
                plan for and develop an interactive greeting card using all of the

            Velocity:
              name: Velocity
              description_student: After a brief review of how the counter pattern
                is used to move sprites, the class is introduced to the properties
                that set velocity and rotation speed directly.   As they use these
                new properties in different ways, they build up the skills they need
                to create a basic side scroller game.
              description_teacher: After a brief review of how they used the counter
                pattern to move sprites in previous lessons, students are introduced
                to the properties that set velocity and rotation speed directly.   As
                they use these new properties in different ways, they build up the
                skills they need to create a basic side scroller game.
            Collision Detection:
              name: Collision Detection
              description_student: The class learns about collision detection on the
                computer.  Pairs explore how a computer could use sprite location
                and size properties and math to detect whether two sprites are touching.  The
                class then uses the isTouching() block to create different effects
                when sprites collide, including playing sounds.  Last, they use their
                new skills to improve the sidescroller game that they started in the
                last lesson.
              description_teacher: Students learn about collision detection on the

                started in the last lesson.
            Complex Sprite Movement:
              name: Complex Sprite Movement
              description_student: 'The class learns to combine the velocity properties
                of sprites with the counter pattern to create more complex sprite
                movement, such as simulating gravity, making a sprite jump, and allowing
                a sprite to float left or right. In the final levels the class combine
                these movements to animate and control a single sprite and build a
                simple game in which a character flies around and collects coins. '
              description_teacher: Students learn to combine the velocity properties
                of sprites with the counter pattern to create more complex sprite
                movement. In particular students will learn how to simulate gravity,
                make a sprite jump, and allow a sprite to float left or right. In
                the final levels of the Code Studio progression students combine these
                movements to animate and control a single sprite and build a simple
                game in which a character flies around and collects a coin. Students
                are encouraged to make their own additions to the game in the final
                level.
            Collisions:
              name: Collisions
              description_student: The class programs their sprites to interact in
                new ways.  After a brief review of how they used the isTouching block,
                the class brainstorms other ways that two sprites could interact.  They
                then use isTouching to make one sprite push another across the screen
                before practicing with the four collision blocks (collide, displace,
                bounce, and bounceOff).
              description_teacher: Students program their sprites to interact in new
                ways.  After a brief review of how they used the `isTouching` block,
                students brainstorm other ways that two sprites could interact.  They
                then use `isTouching` to make one sprite push another across the screen
                before practicing with the four collision blocks (`collide`, `displace`,
                `bounce`, and `bounceOff`).
            Functions:
              name: Functions
              description_student: This lesson covers functions as a way to organize
                their code, make it more readable, and remove repeated blocks of code.
                The class learns that higher level or more abstract steps make it
                easier to understand and reason about steps, then begins to create
                functions in Game Lab.  At the end of the lesson the class uses these
                skills to organize and add functionality to the final version of their
                side scroller game.
              description_teacher: Students learn how to create functions to organize
                their code, make it more readable, and remove repeated blocks of code.
                An unplugged warmup explores how directions at different levels of
                detail can be useful depending on context. Students learn that higher
                level or more abstract steps make it easier to understand and reason
                about steps. Afterwards students learn to create functions in Game
                Lab. They will use functions to remove long blocks of code from their
                draw loop and to replace repeated pieces of code with a single function.
                At the end of the lesson students use these skills to organize and
                add functionality to the final version of their side scroller game.
            The Game Design Process:
              name: The Game Design Process
              description_student: This lesson introduces the process the class will
                use to design games for the remainder of the unit. The class walks
                through through this process in a series of levels. As part of this
                lesson the class also briefly learn to use multi-frame animations
                in Game Lab. At the end of the lesson they have an opportunity to
                make improvements to the game to make it their own.
              description_teacher: This lesson introduces students to the process
                they will use to design games for the remainder of the unit. This
                process is centered around a project guide which asks students to
                define their sprites, variables, and functions before they begin programming
                their game. In this lesson students begin by playing a game on Game
                Lab where the code is hidden. They discuss what they think the sprites,
                variables, and functions would need to be to make the game. They are
                then given a completed project guide which shows one way to implement
                the game. Students are then walked through this process through a
                series of levels. As part of this lesson students also briefly learn
                to use multi-frame animations in Game Lab. At the end of the lesson
                students have an opportunity to make improvements to the game to make
                it their own.
            Using the Game Design Process:
              name: Using the Game Design Process
              description_student: In this multi-day lesson, the class uses the problem
                solving process from Unit 1 to create a platform jumper game.  After
                looking at a sample game, the class defines what their games will
                look like and uses a structured process to build them.  Finally, the
                class reflects on how the games could be improved, and implements
                those changes.
              description_teacher: In this multi-day lesson, students use the problem
                solving process from Unit 1 to create a platform jumper game.  They
                start by looking at an example of a platform jumper, then define what
                their games will look like.  Next, they use a structured process to
                plan the backgrounds, variables, sprites, and functions they will
                need to implement their game.  After writing the code for the game,
                students will reflect on how the game could be improved, and implement
                those changes.
            Project - Design a Game:
              name: Project - Design a Game
              description_student: The class plans and builds original games using
                the project guide from the previous two lessons. Working individually
                or in pairs, the class plans, develops, and gives feedback on the
                games.  After incorporating the peer feedback, the class shares out
                the completed games.
              description_teacher: Students will plan and build their own game using
                the project guide from the previous two lessons to guide their project.
                Working individually or in pairs, students will first decide on the
                type of game they'd like to build, taking as inspiration a set of
                sample games. They will then complete a blank project guide where
                they will describe the game's behavior and scope out the variables,
                sprites, and functions they'll need to build. In Code Studio, a series
                of levels prompts them on a general sequence they can use to implement
                this plan. Partway through the process, students will share their
                projects for peer review and will incorporate feedback as they finish
                their game. At the end of the lesson, students will share their completed
                games with their classmates. This project will span multiple classes
                and can easily take anywhere from 3-5 class periods.

                might serve, both for the users and the creators. The class explores
                a handful of the most-used websites in the United States and discusses
                how each of those sites is useful for users and how it might also

                the problem of how to communicate both the content and structure of
                a website to a computer. The lesson begins with a brief unplugged
                activity demonstrating the challenges of effectively communicating
                the structure of a web page. The class looks at an HTML page in Web
                Lab and discusses how HTML tags help solve this problem, then uses
                HTML to write the first web pages of the unit.

                unplugged activity demonstrating the challenges of effectively communicating
                the structure of a web page. Students then look at an exemplar HTML
                page in Web Lab and discuss with their classmates how HTML tags help
                solve this problem. Students then write their first HTML. A wrap-up
                discussion helps to solidify the understanding of content vs. structure
                that was developed throughout the lesson.

                tags, this time with headers.  The class practices using header tags
                to create page and section titles and learns how the different header
                elements are displayed by default.  Next, the class plans how to organize
                their content on the personal web pages that will be built across
                the unit and begins the first page of the project.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students continue to use HTML to
                structure text on web pages, this time with headings.  Students learn
                how the different heading elements are displayed by default and practice
                using them to create page and section titles.  Students then start
                to decide how they will organize their content on their own personal
                web pages.  In the last level, students begin the project that they

                personal website to talk about personal information people choose
                to share digitally.  The class begins by discussing what types of
                information are good to share with other people, then looks at several
                sample social media pages to see what types of personal information
                could be shared intentionally or unintentionally.  Finally, the class
                comes up with a set of guidelines to follow when putting information
                online.
              description_teacher: "As students have recently spent some time thinking
                about the actual content that will go into their personal website,
                this lesson takes a step back from the unit-long project (publication
                of a personal website) to help students articulate what personal information
                they choose to share digitally and with whom.  It also reinforces
                the notion that much of the information that they choose to share
                digitally falls largely out of their control the moment it is released.
                \ \r\n\r\nStudents begin by individually identifying appropriate audiences
                with whom they would be comfortable sharing given pieces of personal
                information.  They then look at several social media pages to determine
                what sorts of information people are sharing about themselves or one
                another.  Last, students reflect on what guidelines they think are
                appropriate for posting information online.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate point
                of this lesson is not to scare students, but rather to experientially
                bring students to realizing precisely what level of control they don’t
                have in releasing information into the web."

                of the creator of that media. After first studying Creative Commons
                licensing, the class learns how to add images to web pages, and how
                to give proper attribution when doing so.
              description_teacher: "Starting with an discussion of their personal
                opinions on how others should be allowed to use their work, the class
                explores the purpose and role of copyright for both creators and users
                of creative content.  They then move on to an activity exploring the
                various Creative Commons licenses as a solution to the difficulty
                in dealing with copyright. \r\n\r\nFinally, with a common understanding
                of the restrictions of various Creative Commons licenses, students
