                include width and height parameters and to use the background() block
                to fill the screen with color. At the end of the progression the class

              description_teacher: In this lesson students continue to develop their
                drawing skills. At the beginning of the lesson a teacher-led discussion
                connects expanded block functionality (e.g. different sized shapes)
                with the need for more block inputs, or "parameters". Students learn
                to draw with versions of `ellipse()` and `rect()` that include width
                and height parameters. They also learn to use the `background()` block.
                At the end of the progression students are introduced to the `randomNumber()`

                dots and then with sprites. Afterwards, everyone uses what they learned
                to update the sprite scene from the previous lesson.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students are introduced to the draw
                loop, one of the core programming paradigms in Game Lab. To begin
                the lesson students look at some physical flipbooks to see that having
                many frames with different images creates the impression of motion.
                Students then watch a video explaining how the draw loop in Game Lab
                helps to create this same impression in their programs. Students combine
                the draw loop with random numbers to manipulate some simple animations
                with dots and then with sprites. At the end of the lesson students

              description_teacher: Students start by using booleans to compare the
                current value of a sprite property with a target value, using that
                comparison to determine when a sprite has reached a point on the screen,
                grown to a given size, or otherwise reached a value using the counter
                pattern. After using booleans directly to investigate the values or
                sprite properties, students add conditional _if_ statements to write
                code that responds to those boolean comparisons.

                statements to move sprites around the screen. By the end of this lesson
                students will have written programs that take keyboard input from
                the user to control sprites on the screen.

                game of Stand Up, Sit Down in which the boolean (true/false) statements
                describe personal properties (hair or eye color, clothing type, age,
                etc). The class then groups objects based on increasingly complex
                boolean statements, then looks at how conditionals can impact the
                flow of a program.

                In this lesson, students are introduced to boolean values and logic, as well as conditional statements. The class starts by playing a simple game of Stand Up, Sit Down in which the boolean (true/false) statements describe personal properties (hair or eye color, clothing type, age, etc). This gets students thinking about how they can frame a property with multiple potential values (such as age) with a binary question.

                From there students are provided a group of objects with similar, yet varying, physical properties. With a partner they group those objects based on increasingly complex boolean statements, including compound booleans with AND and OR.

                Finally we reveal Conditionals as a tool to make decisions or impact the flow of a program using boolean statements as input.

              description_teacher: Students will plan and build their own game using
                the project guide from the previous two lessons to guide their project.
                Working individually or in pairs, students will first decide on the
                type of game they'd like to build, taking as inspiration a set of
                sample games. They will then complete a blank project guide where
                they will describe the game's behavior and scope out the variables,
                sprites, and functions they'll need to build. In Code Studio, a series
                of levels prompts them on a general sequence they can use to implement
                this plan. Partway through the process, students will share their
                projects for peer review and will incorporate feedback as they finish
                their game. At the end of the lesson, students will share their completed
                games with their classmates. This project will span multiple classes
                and can easily take anywhere from 3-5 class periods.

            Unit 1 is a highly interactive and collaborative introduction to the field of computer science, as framed within the broader pursuit of solving problems. You’ll practice using a problem solving process to address a series of puzzles, challenges, and real world scenarios. Next, you’ll learn how computers input, output, store, and process information to help humans solve problems.  The unit concludes with a project in which you design an application that helps solve a problem of your choosing.\r

                device and select the inputs and outputs used for that activity from
                the chart.
            Processing:
              name: Vinnsla
              description_student: This lesson dives deeper into the concept of processing
                that was introduced as part of the definition of a computer.  Pairs
                work together to puta deck of cards in order, a form of processing
                information.  In the end, the class discusses what processing means
                within the context of solving information problems.
              description_teacher: Students complete two unplugged card sorting activities
                to explore the meaning of processing and its relationship to problem-solving.
                The first has few constraints and is used to introduce a high-level
                definition of processing. The next introduces more constraints that
                forces students to develop an algorithm that will always successfully
                process the cards. Students iteratively develop, test, and share their
                algorithms with classmates. A wrap-up discussion has students reflect
                on the different types of problem-solving they used in these activities
                and the value of producing an algorithm to solve a problem.
            Storage:
              name: Vistun
              description_student: This lesson focuses on the storage component of
                the definition of a computer, within the content of processing information.
                The class spends the majority of the lesson developing and sharing
                algorithms to process information, with an emphasis on how much storage
                is needed for any particular algorithm. The lesson concludes with
                a discussion of the importance of storage while processing information.
              description_teacher: Students explore the importance of storage within
                the Input-Storage-Processing-Output model of a computer. The warm-up
                activity asks students to reflect on the types of information they
                have seen computers store in the past, like documents, photographs,
                or videos. The unplugged main activity has students develop an algorithm
                to process a small pile of cards in search of specific cards within
                the deck. Constraints on how students can move the cards force them
                to consider the importance of storage even while they are processing
                the deck. The lesson concludes with a discussion of the two types
                of storage students saw in this lesson and the importance of storage
                while processing information.
            Apps and Problem Solving:
              name: Öpp og Þrautalausnir
              description_student: 'This lesson covers the input and output aspects

                specific problems that they were designed to solve, the inputs that
                they need to work, and the outputs they provide to users. The class
                concludes with observations of these apps as well as a teacher led

                personal website to talk about personal information people choose
                to share digitally.  The class begins by discussing what types of
                information are good to share with other people, then looks at several
                sample social media pages to see what types of personal information
                could be shared intentionally or unintentionally.  Finally, the class
                comes up with a set of guidelines to follow when putting information
                online.
              description_teacher: |-
                As students have recently spent some time thinking about the actual content that will go into their personal website, this lesson takes a step back from the unit-long project (publication of a personal website) to help students articulate what personal information they choose to share digitally and with whom.  It also reinforces the notion that much of the information that they choose to share digitally falls largely out of their control the moment it is released.  \r
                \r
                Students begin by individually identifying appropriate audiences with whom they would be comfortable sharing given pieces of personal information.  They then look at several social media pages to determine what sorts of information people are sharing about themselves or one another.  Last, students reflect on what guidelines they think are appropriate for posting information online.\r
                \r
                The ultimate point of this lesson is not to scare students, but rather to experientially bring students to realizing precisely what level of control they don’t have in releasing information into the web.

                search engines work, students will search for information about several

                a hoax.

              description_student: This lesson covers the purposes that a website
                might serve, both for the users and the creators. The class explores
                a handful of the most-used websites in the United States and discusses
                how each of those sites is useful for users and how it might also
                serve its creators.
              description_teacher: Every website has a purpose, a reason someone created
                it and others use it. In this lesson, students will start to consider
                the purposes a website might serve, both for the users and the creators.
                Students will explore a handful of the most-used websites in the United
                States and try to figure out how each of those sites is useful for
                users and how they might also serve their creators.

              description_student: 'This lesson introduces websites as a means of
                personal expression.  The class first discusses different ways that
                people express and share their interests and ideas, then looks at
                a few exemplar websites made by students from a previous course. Finally
                everyone brainstorms and shares a list of topics and interests to
                include, creating a resource for developing a personal website in
                the rest of the unit. '
              description_teacher: In this lesson students investigate ways to use
                websites as a means of personal expression and develop a list of topics
                and interests that they would want to include on a personal website.
                To begin the lesson students brainstorm different ways that people
                express and share their interests and ideas. Students then look at
                a few exemplar websites made by students from a previous CS Discoveries
                course to identify ways they are expressing their ideas. Finally students
                brainstorm and share a list of topics and interests they might want
                to include on a personal website which they can reference for ideas
                as they progress through the unit.

                the problem of how to communicate both the content and structure of
                a website to a computer. The lesson begins with a brief unplugged
                activity demonstrating the challenges of effectively communicating
                the structure of a web page. The class looks at an HTML page in Web
                Lab and discusses how HTML tags help solve this problem, then uses
                HTML to write the first web pages of the unit.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students are introduced HTML as

                tags, this time with headers.  The class practices using header tags
                to create page and section titles and learns how the different header
                elements are displayed by default.  Next, the class plans how to organize
                their content on the personal web pages that will be built across
                the unit and begins the first page of the project.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students continue to use HTML to
                structure text on web pages, this time with headers.  Students learn
                how the different header elements are displayed by default and practice
                using them to create page and section titles.  Students then start
                to decide how they will organize their content on their own personal
                web pages.  In the last level, students begin the project that they
                will continue to work on throughout the unit.

                page project to add a new HTML page that includes the new tags.
              description_teacher: Students are introduced to ordered and unordered
                lists in HTML and work through a few levels in which they use the
                &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, and &lt;li&gt; tags.  They then go back to
                their project, where they add a new HTML page.  Inside the new page,
                they write the HTML to display a recipe, top ten list, or any other
                content that uses the new tags that they have learned.

                video, or music created by others a website while respecting the rights
                of the creator of that media. After first studying Creative Commons
                licensing, the class learns how to add images to web pages, and how
                to give proper attribution when doing so.
              description_teacher: |-
                Starting with an discussion of their personal opinions on how others should be allowed to use their work, the class explores the purpose and role of copyright for both creators and users of creative content.  They then move on to an activity exploring the various Creative Commons licenses as a solution to the difficulty in dealing with copyright. \r
                \r
                Finally, with a common understanding of the restrictions of various Creative Commons licenses, students learn how to add images to their web pages using the &lt;img&gt; tag.

            Through a series of design challenges, you will learn how to better understand
            the needs of others while developing a solution to a problem. The second
            half of the unit consists of an iterative team project, during which teams
            have the opportunity to identify a need that they care about, prototype
            solutions both on paper and in App Lab, and test solutions with real users
            to get feedback and drive further iteration.

                basis for the type of app they will make. From there, teams will have
                some time to discuss the basic functionality of their app before using

                students to better scope their expectations. Because students will
                eventually be prototyping these apps in App Lab, they will be in better
                shape if their ideas align with the kinds of apps that are easily
                prototyped in App Lab. Teams start this scoping by looking through
                several example apps designed to demonstrate apps that can be created

          description: Unit 6 explores the role of hardware platforms in computing
            and how different sensors can provide more effective input and output
            than the traditional keyboard, mouse, and monitor. Using App Lab and Adafruit’s
            Circuit Playground, you’ll develop programs that utilize the same hardware
            inputs and outputs that you see in the smart devices, looking at how a
            simple rough prototype can lead to a finished product. The unit concludes
            with a design challenge to use the Circuit Playground as the basis for
            an innovation of your own design.

                will do some research into interesting innovations in computing. This
                lesson will expose students to wider variety of computing form factors
                (what a computer looks like) and fields that are impacted by computing.
                Later in this unit students will look back on the devices they encountered
                in this lesson as they develop their own physical computing devices.

              description_teacher: In preparation for delving deeper into programming
                with App Lab, students will explore how a handful of different programs
                written in both Game Lab and App Lab handle taking input from the
                user. After comparing and contrasting the approaches they saw in the

                for input (conditionals in an infinite and asynchronous events) to
                gain a better understanding of how they work.
            Event Types:
              name: Event Types
              description_student: Review the basics of programming in App Lab and
                explore some new event types that can be used in your programs.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students review the material they
                learned about creating apps in App Lab from Unit 4 in order to prepare
                for a return to App Lab in this unit. This review should be modified
                to best meet the needs of your students and their experience and familiarity
                with programming in App Lab. In addition to the review the students
                will also experiment with a variety of new event types that they likely
                have not seen before.
            Getters and Setters:
              name: Getters and Setters
              description_student: To expand the kinds of interactions that students
                can use in App Lab we introduce the concept of "getters" and "setters",
                commands which can get and set (or change) the content and properties
                of various design elements.

            The Circuit Playground:
              name: The Circuit Playground
              description_student: Students are introduced to the Circuit Playground,
                a microcomputer that will be the platform used throughout the rest
                of this unit.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students get their first opportunity
                to write programs that use the Circuit Playground for output. After
                first inspecting the board visually and hypothesizing possibly functionalities,
                students move online where they will learn to write applications that
                blink an LED and make noise with a buzzer.
            Lists:

                related values in a single variable.
              description_teacher: Students learn to use lists to store a series of
                related values in a single variable. From there, students will explore
                ways to extract either a specific or random value from a list using
                its index.
            Lights:
              name: Lights
              description_student: 'Now that students have learned how lists can be
                used to deal with groups of related values, we''ll return to the board
                and look at the color LEDs, which are accessed through the list `colorLeds`. '

              description_student: Students are introduced to the for loop in this
                lesson as a way to repeat some code a certain numbers of times. They
                spend time practicing in an unplugged context with simple robot commands
                and then take their knowledge into App Lab.

              description_student: 'In this lesson students combine what they have
                learned about lists and for loops. Students use for loops to go through
                each element in a list one at a time without having to write code
                for each element. Towards the end of the lesson students will apply

              description_student: In this lesson we build on students understanding
                of for loops to learn about a more sophisticated structure called
                a timed loop. Unlike for loops, you can control how quickly a timed
                loop repeats, and other code (such as event handlers) can be run between
                iterations of the loop. This allows us to create interesting animations
                that repeat infinitely, while still allowing other code to run alongside
                it.

            Designing Screens with Code:
              name: Designing Screens with Code
              description_student: By reading and changing the content on the screen
                of an app, the class starts to build apps that only need a single
                screen. Even with just one screen, these techniques allow for lots
                of user interaction and functionality.
              description_teacher: In Unit 4 students learned a very simple approach
                to app development in App Lab that required a separate screen for
                most interactions. To expand the kinds of apps that students can make,
                and to encourage them to think in new ways about how users interact
                with apps, we introduce the `setProperty()` block. This command can
                be used to set the content and properties of various UI elements,
                allowing students to write programs that update information on a single
                screen, instead of manually creating duplicate screens. In this lesson
                students build up simple apps that only require a single screen, the
                content of which is changed using `setProperty()`.
            Board Events:
              name: Board Events
              description_student: Using the hardware buttons and switch, the class
                develops programs that use the Circuit Playground as an input.
              description_teacher: This lesson transitions students from consider
                the Circuit Playground as strictly an output device towards using
                it as a tool for both input and output. Starting with the hardware
                buttons and switch,sing the hardware buttons and switch, students
                learn to use `onBoardEvent()`, analogously to `onEvent()`, in order
                to take input from their Circuit Playgrounds.
            Getting Properties:
              name: Getting Properties
              description_student: This lesson introduces students to the getProperty
                block, which allows them to access the properties of different elements
                with code.  Students first practice using the block to determine what
                the user has input in various user interface elements. Students later
                use getProperty and setProperty together with the counter patters
                to make elements move across the screen.  A new screen element, the
                slider, and a new event trigger, onChange, are also introduced.
              description_teacher: This lesson introduces students to the `getProperty`
                block, which allows them to access the properties of different elements

            The Program Design Process:
              name: The Program Design Process
              description_student: This lesson introduces students to the process
                they will use to design programs of their own throughout this unit.
                This process is centered around a project guide which asks students
                to sketch out their screens, identify elements of the Circuit Playground
                to be used, define variables, and describe events before they begin
                programming. This process is similar to the Game Design Process that
                we used in Unit 3. In this lesson students begin by playing a tug
                o' war style game where the code is hidden. They discuss what they
                think the board components, events, and variables would need to be
                to make the program. They are then given a completed project guide
                which shows one way to implement the project. Students are then walked
                through this process through a series of levels. At the end of the
                lesson students have an opportunity to make improvements to the program
                to make it their own.

              name: Arrays
              description_student: Learn how lists can be used to store multiple values
                in a single variable name.
              description_teacher: An array is an ordered collection of items, usually
                of the same type. In this lesson, students learn ways to access either
                a specific or random value from a list using its index.  They then
                learn how to access the colorLEDs array that controls the behavior
                of the color LEDs on the Circuit Playground.  Students will control
                the color and intensity of each LED, then use what they have learned
                to program light patterns to create a light show on their Circuit
                Playground.
            Making Music:

              description_student: In this lesson students will use the buzzer to
                its full extent by producing sounds, notes, and songs with the buzzer.
                Students start with a short review of the buzzer's frequency and duration
                parameters, then move on to the concept of notes.  Notes allow students
                to constrain themselves to frequencies that are used in Western music
                and provide a layer of abstraction that helps them to understand which
                frequencies might sound good together.  Onces students are able to
                play notes on the buzzer, they use arrays to hold and play sequences
                of notes, forming simple songs.

            Arrays and For Loops:
              name: Arrays and For Loops
              description_student: Combining _lists_ and _for loops_ allows you to
                write code that impacts every element of a list, regardless of how
                long it is. The class uses this structure to write programs that process
                all of the elements in lists, include the list of color LEDs.
              description_teacher: Using a _for loop_ to iterate over all of the elements
                in an array is a really useful construct in most programming languages.
                In this lesson, students learn the basics of how a _for loop_ can
                be used to repeat code, and then combine it with what they've already
                learned about arrays to write programs that process all elements in
                an array. Students use for loops to go through each element in a list
                one at a time without having to write code for each element. Towards
                the end of the lesson students will apply this with the `colorLed`
                list on the board to create an app that changes all of the LEDs each
                time a button is clicked.
            Accelerometer:

                and its capabilities. They’ll become familiar with its events and
                properties, as well as create multiple programs utilizing the accelerometer
                similar to those they’ve likely come across in real world applications.

                in the context of App Lab blocks that they students have seen recently.  Students
                then look at examples of parameters within user-created functions
                in App Lab and create and call functions with parameters for themselves,
                using them to control multiple elements on a screen.  Afterwards,
                students use for loops to iterate over an array, passing each element
                into a function.  Last, students use what they have learned to create
                a star catching game.

                data that does not easily fit into the visualization scheme that they
                have chosen.  Last, students look at what parts of this process can
                be automated, and what need a human to make decisions.
            Automating Data Decisions:
              name: Automating Data Decisions
              description_student: In this lesson students look at a simple example
                of how a computer could be used to complete essentially every step
                of the data problem solving process. To begin students are given the
                clean data they collected about their ice cream preferences. They
                use a spreadsheet to visualize this data using simple charts and discuss
                in groups the decision they would make with this data. Students then
                create rules, or an algorithm, that a computer could use to make this
                decision automatically. Groups share their rules and what choices
                their rules would make with the class data. They then use their rules
                on data from another class to reinforce the fact that the rules they
                create should be useful for any data set. The lesson concludes with
                a discussion about the benefits and drawbacks of using computers to
                automate the data problem solving process.

            Problem Solving with Big Data:
              name: Problem Solving with Big Data
              description_student: In this lesson, students look at how data is collected
                and used by a organizations to solve problems in the real world. The
                lesson begins with a quick review of the data problem solving process
                they have explored in this unit. Then students are presented three
                scenarios that could be solved using data and they brainstorm the
                types of data they would want to solve them and how they could collect
                the data. Each problem is designed to reflect a real-world service
                that exists. After brainstorming students will watch a video about
                a real-world service and will record notes about what data is collected
                by the real-world service and how it is used. At the end of the lesson
                students record whether data was provided actively by a user, was
                recorded passively, or is collected by sensors.

            Project - Solve a Data Problem:
              name: Project - Solve a Data Problem
              description_student: To conclude this unit students will design a way
                to use data to make a recommendation or prediction to help solve a
                problem. Students will follow a project guide to complete this multi-day
                activity. In the first several steps students brainstorm problems,
                perform simple research, and define a problem of their choosing. They
                will then decide what kind of data they would want to collect, how
                it could be collected, and how it could be used. Students will perform
                a peer review and make any necessary updates to their project before
                preparing a presentation to their classmates.

            Representing Numbers:
              name: Representing Numbers
              description_student: In this lesson, students learn about the binary
                number system.  With a set of cards that represent the place values
                in a binary (base-2) number system by a collection of dots, students
                turn bits "on" or "off" by turning cards face up and face down, then
                observe the numbers that result from these different patterns.  Eventually,
                student extend the pattern to a generic 4-bit system.

            8-bit Numbers:
              name: 8-bita Tölur
              description_student: Students review the concept of binary numbers,
                and discuss that they need to know the bit-length of each number in
                order to decode a series of bits.  They then made a flippy-do, a paper
                manipulative that will help them to encode and decode 8-bit numbers
                (0-255).  After practicing with the flippy-do, students discuss how
                they could extend that standardization to the other types of data.

            Encryption:
              name: Encryption
              description_student: Students have a discussion on the different levels
                of security they would like for personal data.  Once the class has
                developed an understanding of the importance of privacy, they learn
                about the process of encrypting information by enciphering a note
                for a partner and deciphering the partner's note.  The class concludes
                with a discussion about the importance of both physical and digital
                security.

            Structuring Data:
              name: Structuring Data
              description_student: This lesson goes further into the interpretation
                of data, including cleaning and visualizing raw data sets.  The class
                first looks at the how presenting data in different ways can help
                people to understand it better.  After seeing how cleaning and visualization
                can help people make better decisions, the class looks at what parts
                of this process can be automated, and what need a human.

                (like arrow buttons being pressed.) At the end of the puzzle, students
                will have the opportunity to customize their game with different speeds
                and sounds.
            Nested Loops:
              name: Innri lykkjur
              description_student: Loops inside loops inside loops. What does this
                mean? This lesson will teach you what happens when you place a loop
                inside another loop.
              description_teacher: In this online activity, students will have the
                opportunity to push their understanding of loops to a whole new level.
                Playing with the Bee and Plants vs Zombies, students will learn how
                to program a loop to be inside of another loop. They will also be
                encouraged to figure out how little changes in either loop will affect
                their program when they click `Run`.
            Nested Loops in Artist:
              name: Nested Loops in Artist
              description_student: More nested loops! This time, you get to make some
                AMAZING drawing with nested loops.
              description_teacher: Students will create intricate designs using Artist
                in today's set of puzzles. By continuing to practice nested loops
                with new goals, students will see more uses of loops in general. This
                set of puzzles also offers a lot more potential for creativity with
                an opportunity for students to create their own design at the end
                of the stage.
            'Algorithms: Relay Programming':
              name: 'Algorithms: Relay Programming'
              description_student: Remember at the beginning of the course when you
                made drawings with code? In this lesson, you will be working with
                a team to do something very similar!
              description_teacher: This activity will begin with a short review of
                "Graph Paper Programming," then will quickly move to a race against
                the clock, as students break into teams and work together to write
                a program one instruction at a time.

            While Loops in Farmer:
              name: While Loops in Farmer
              description_student: 'Loops are so useful in coding. This lesson will
                teach you about a new kind of loop: while loops!'
              description_teacher: "By the time students reach this lesson, they should
                already have plenty of practice using `repeat` loops, so now it's
                time to mix things up. \n\n_While loops_ are loops that continue to
                repeat commands while a condition is met. While loops are used when
                the programmer doesn't know the exact number of times commands need
                to be repeated, but does know what condition needs to be true in order
                for the loop to continue repeating. For example, students will be
                working to fill holes and dig dirt in Farmer. They will not know the
                size of the holes or the height of the mountains of dirt, but the
                students will know they need to keep filling the holes and digging
                the dirt as long as the ground is not flat."
            Conditionals with Cards:
              name: Skilyrði með kortum
              description_student: It's time to play a game where you earn points
                only under certain conditions!
              description_teacher: 'This lesson demonstrates how conditionals can
                be used to tailor a program to specific information. We don’t always
                have all of the information we need when writing a program. Sometimes
                you will want to do something different in one situation than in another,
                even if you don''t know what situation will be true when your code
                runs. That is where conditionals come in. Conditionals allow a computer
                to make a decision, based on the information that is true any time
                your code is run.

              description_student: 'Now that you understand conditionals, it''s time
                to program Bee to use them when collecting honey and nectar. '
              description_teacher: Up until this point students have been writing
                code that executes exactly the same way each time it is run - reliable,
                but not very flexible. In this lesson, your class will begin to code
                with conditionals, allowing them to write code that functions differently
                depending on the specific conditions the program encounters.
            Conditionals & Loops in Maze:
              name: Conditionals & Loops in Maze
              description_student: You can do some amazing things when you use conditionals
                and loops together!
              description_teacher: 'In this lesson, students will be pairing together
                two key concepts: loops and conditionals. This set of puzzles bridges
                the gaps in understanding that occur when working on puzzles that
                use multiple kinds of blocks. By bringing two ideas together, students
                will create more complex code that shows both impressive creativity
                and critical thinking!'
            Conditionals & Loops in Farmer:
              name: Conditionals & Loops in Farmer
              description_student: It's not always clear when to use each conditional.  This
                lesson will help you get practice deciding what to do.
              description_teacher: Students will practice `while` loops, `until` loops,
                and `if / else` statements. All of these blocks use conditionals.
                By practicing all three, students will learn to write complex and
                flexible code.
            Digital Citizenship:
              name: Stafrænn borgari
              description_student: Some information is not safe to share online. This
                lesson will help you learn the difference between safe and private
                information.
              description_teacher: |-
                In collaboration with Common Sense Education, this lesson helps students learn to think critically about the user information that some websites request or require. Students learn the difference between private information and personal information, distinguishing what is safe and unsafe to share online.

                Students will also explore what it means to be responsible and respectful to their offline and online communities as a step toward learning how to be good digital citizens.
            Build a Play Lab Game:
              name: Build a Play Lab Game
              description_student: This lesson will guide you through making your
                very own video game.
              description_teacher: In this online activity, students will have the
                opportunity to learn how to use events in Play Lab and to apply all
                of the coding skills they've learned to create an animated game. It's
                time to get creative and make a game in Play Lab!
            'Unplugged: Binary':
              name: 'Verkefni án tölvu: Tvíundir'
              description_student: 'Learn how computers store pictures using simple
                ideas like on and off. '
              description_teacher: Though many people think of binary as strictly
                zeros and ones, students will be introduced to the idea that information
                can be represented in a variety of binary options. This lesson takes
                that concept one step further as it illustrates how a computer can
                store even more complex information (such as images and colors) in
                binary, as well.
            Artist Binary:
              name: 'Listamaður: Tvíundir'
              description_student: Direct your own artist to create a binary image
                using only commands to turn pixels on and off.
              description_teacher: Binary is extremely important in the world of computers.
                The majority of computers today store all sorts of information in
                binary form. This lesson helps demonstrate how it is possible to take
                something from real life and translate it into a series of ons and
                offs. Students will build binary images in Artist by translating 0s
                and 1s to offs and ons (or blacks and whites).
            Nested Loops Project in Artist:
              name: Nested Loops Project in Artist
              description_student: Here you will be using nested loops to make cool
                projects to show to your family and friends.
              description_teacher: Now that students know how to layer their loops,
                they can create so many beautiful things.  This lesson will take students
                through a series of exercises to help them create their own portfolio-ready
                images.
            Debugging in Collector:
              name: Debugging in Collector
              description_student: Have you ever run into problems while coding? In
                this lesson, you will learn about the secrets of debugging. Debugging
                is the process of finding and fixing problems in your code.
              description_teacher: In this online activity, students will practice
                debugging in the "collector" environment. Students will get to practice
                reading and editing code to fix puzzles with simple algorithms, loops
                and nested loops.

                This project will help individuals gain experience with coding and
                produce an exemplar to share with peers and loved ones. Intended to
                be a multi-lesson or multi-week experience, students will spend time
                exploring brainstorming, learning about the design process, building,
                and presenting their final work. \n\nIn the explore stage, students
                will be able to view pre-built examples of projects in both Artist
                and Play Lab for inspiration. Next, students will learn about the
                design process and how to implement it in their own projects. They
                will then be given the space to create their own project in either
                Artist or Play Lab (this is likely the longest stage of the project).
                Finally, students will be able to present their finished work to their

              description_teacher: Over the course of four lessons, students will
                be building up to programming a project of their own design using
                either Play Lab or Artist as their programming environment. In this
                portion of the project, students will learn about the design process
                and how to implement it in their own projects. The lesson guide for
                all four stages of the process can be found in the first stage of

                certain conditions in this fun and challenging series.
              description_teacher: This lesson introduces students to `while` loops
                and `if / else` statements. _While loops_ are loops that continue
                to repeat commands as long as a condition is true. While loops are
                used when the programmer doesn't know the exact number of times the
                commands need to be repeated, but the programmer does know what condition
                needs to be true in order for the loop to continue looping. `If /
                Else` statements offer flexibility in programming by running entire
                sections of code only if something is true, otherwise it runs something
                else.

              description_teacher: |-
                Developed by Common Sense Education, this lesson is about the difference between information that is safe to share online and information that is not.

                As students visit sites that request information about their identities, they learn to adopt a critical inquiry process that empowers them to protect themselves and their families from identity theft. In this lesson, students learn to think critically about the user information that some websites request or require. They learn the difference between private information and personal information, as well as how to distinguish what is safe or unsafe to share online.

                to build a game that they can share online. Featuring R2-D2 and other
                Star Wars characters, students will be guided through events, then
                given space to create their own game.

              description_student: Even rockstars need programming skills. This lesson
                will teach you about functions using lyrics from songs.
              description_teacher: One of the most magnificent structures in the computer
                science world is the function. Functions (sometimes called procedures)
                are mini programs that you can use over and over inside of your bigger
                program. This lesson will help students intuitively understand why
                combining chunks of code into functions can be such a helpful practice.
            Functions in Artist:
              name: Functions in Artist
              description_student: Make complex drawings more easily with functions!
              description_teacher: Students will be introduced to using functions
                on Code.org. Magnificent images will be created and modified with
                functions in Artist. For more complicated patterns, students will
                learn about nesting functions by calling one function from inside
                another.

              description_teacher: Students have practiced creating impressive designs
                in Artist and navigating mazes in Bee, but today they will use functions
                to harvest crops in Farmer. This lesson will push students to use
                functions in the new ways by combining them with `while` loops and
                `if / else` statements.
            Determine the Concept:
              name: Determine the Concept
              description_student: "We aren't giving away any secrets! \nThis lesson
                could use any of the skills you've learned so far."
              description_teacher: This lesson brings together concepts from the previous
                lessons and gives students a chance to think critically about how
                they would solve each problem, but without telling them which concept
                to apply. Students will review basic algorithms, debugging, `repeat`
                loops, conditionals, `while` loops, and functions.
            Build a Play Lab Game:
              name: Build a Play Lab Game
              description_student: Practice making games to share with your friends
                and family.
              description_teacher: This lesson features Play Lab, a platform where
                students can create their own games and have interactions between
                characters and user input. Students will work with events to create
                keyboard controls. This set of puzzles will also loosely guide students
                through game development, but with freedom to add their own ideas.
            Present Your Project:
              name: Present Your Project
              description_student: Get ready to show off! It's time to present your
                finished project to your peers.
              description_teacher: Over the course of four lessons, students will
                be building up to programming a project of their own design using
                either Play Lab or Artist as their programming environment. Finally,
                students will be able to present their finished work to their peers
                or share with their loved ones with a special link. The lesson guide
                for all four stages of the process can be found in the first stage
                of this project process [here](https://curriculum.code.org/csf/coursee/12/).

              description_student: Ever wondered how information travels across the
                internet? It's not magic! This lesson will teach you the basics of
                how the internet works.
              description_teacher: Even though many people use the internet daily,
                not very many know how it works. In this lesson, students will pretend
                to flow through the internet, all the while learning about connections,
                URLs, IP Addresses, and the DNS.
            Crowdsourcing:
              name: Hópvistun
              description_student: This lesson will teach you about crowdsourcing,
                the process of building a project with a team.
              description_teacher: In computer science, we face some big, daunting
                problems. Challenges such as finding large prime numbers or sequencing
                DNA are almost impossible to do as an individual. Adding the power
                of others makes these tasks manageable. This lesson will show your
                students how helpful teamwork can be in the industry of computer science.

          description: Created with fourth grade students in mind, this course begins
            with a brief review of concepts previously taught in courses C and D.
            This introduction is intended to inspire beginners and remind the experts
            of the wonders of computer science. Students will practice coding with
            algorithms, loops, conditionals, and events before they are introduced
            to functions. At the end of the course, students will have the opportunity
            to create a capstone project that they can proudly share with peers and
            loved ones.
        coursef:
          stages:
            'Algorithms: Tangrams':
              name: 'Algorithms: Tangrams'
              description_student: Here you will learn about algorithms using puzzles
                called tangrams!
              description_teacher: This lesson shows us something important about
                algorithms. As long as you keep an algorithm simple, there are lots
                of ways to use it. However, if you want to make sure everyone produces
                the same outcome, then your algorithm needs more detail. Students
                will learn the difference between a detailed and general algorithm
                while playing with tangrams.
            Introduction:
              name: Kynning
              description_student: This lesson will give you a brief introduction
                to some of the amazing things you will learn in this course!
              description_teacher: 'In this lesson, students will be introduced to
                sequences, loops, and nested loops to prepare them for more complicated
                concepts in the later part of the course. This "ramp up" lesson equalizes
                the playing field between the experts and the beginners in your class. '
            The Power of Words:
              name: The Power of Words
              description_student: Bullying is never okay. This lesson will teach
                you about what is and isn't okay to say online.
              description_teacher: "Students consider that while they are enjoying
                their favorite websites they may encounter messages from other kids
                that can make them feel angry, hurt, sad, or fearful. They explore
                ways to handle cyberbullying and how to respond in the face of upsetting
                language online.\n\nStudents discuss all the ways they use technology
                for communication and explore the similarities and differences between
                in-person and online communication. Students then brainstorm ways
                to respond to cyberbullying. "
            Ice Age Play Lab:
              name: Ice Age Leikjasmiðja
              description_student: Think of your favorite video game. Ever wondered
                how it was made? In these puzzles you will develop a video game of
                your own with friends from Ice Age!
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students are guided through a story
                featuring characters from Ice Age. Students will work with events
                and loops to make characters move on the screen, and will get the
                chance to create their own game or story after the guided levels.
            Envelope Variables:
              name: Umslagabreytur
              description_student: 'Envelopes and variables have something in common:
                both can hold valuable things. Here you will learn what variables
                are and the awesome things they can do.'
              description_teacher: Variables are used as placeholders for values such
                as numbers or words. Variables allow for a lot of freedom in programming.
                Instead of having to type out a phrase many times or remember an obscure
                number, computer scientists can use variables to reference them. This
                lesson helps to explain what variables are and how we can use them
                in many different ways. The idea of variables isn't an easy concept
                to grasp, so we recommend allowing plenty of time for discussion at
                the end of the lesson.
            Variables in Artist:
              name: Variables in Artist
              description_student: Don't forget to bring creativity to class! In these
                puzzles you will be making fantastic drawings using variables.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students will explore the creation
                of repetitive designs using variables in the Artist environment. Students
                will learn how variables can be used to make code easier to write
                and easier to read. After guided puzzles, students will end in a freeplay
                level to show what they have learned and create their own designs.
            Variables in Play Lab:
              name: Variables in Play Lab
              description_student: Soon you will learn about making characters interact
                in a game using variables!
              description_teacher: Students will get further practice with variables
                in this lesson by creating scenes in Play Lab. Students will work
                with user input to set the values of their variables, then get space
                to create their own mini-project with variables.
            For Loop Fun:
              name: Fyndnar frá lykkjur
              description_student: You're going to have loads of fun learning about
                `for` loops!
              description_teacher: 'We know that loops allow us to do things over
                and over again, but now we’re going to learn how to use loops that
                have extra structures built right in. These new structures will allow
                students to create code that is more powerful and dynamic. '
            For Loops in Bee:
              name: For Loops in Bee
              description_student: Buzz buzz. In these puzzles you will be guiding
                a bee to nectar and honey using `for` loops!
              description_teacher: Featuring Bee, this lesson focuses on for loops
                and using an incrementing variable to solve more complicated puzzles.
                Students will begin by reviewing loops from previous lessons, then
                walked through using for loops to more effectively solve complicated
                problems.
            For Loops in Artist:
              name: For Loops in Artist
              description_student: Get ready to make your next masterpiece. Here you
                will be using `for` loops to make some jaw-dropping pictures.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students continue to practice for
                loops, this time with Artist. Students will complete puzzles combining
                the ideas of variables, loops, and for loops to create complex designs.
                At the end, they will have a chance to create their own art in a freeplay
                level.
            Songwriting with Parameters:
              name: Lagasmíð með stikum
              description_student: You just might release the next big hit single!
                In this lesson, you will be learning what parameters are and how they
                make some fantastic songs!
              description_teacher: One of the most magnificent structures in the computer
                science world is the function. Functions (sometimes called procedures)
                are mini programs that you can use over and over inside of your bigger
                program. This lesson will help students intuitively understand why
                combining chunks of code into functions is such a helpful practice,
                and how they can use those structures even when chunks of code are
                slightly different.
            Conditionals and Functions in Bee:
              name: Býflugan - Skilyrðingar og Föll
              description_student: The bee needs your help again! Here you will be
                using functions to get nectar and make honey!
              description_teacher: 'This lesson teaches students how to create simple
                functions using our sophisticated “modal” function editor, preparing
                the way for them to incorporate parameters in future lessons. '
            Functions with Parameters in Artist:
              name: Functions with Parameters in Artist
              description_student: Get your programming fingers ready. In these puzzles
                you will make impressive drawings in Artist using functions with parameters.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students continue working with
                functions with and without parameters. Students will get the chance
                to create their own drawings with and without parameters, before modifying
                functions in a freeplay level.
            Functions with Parameters in Bee:
              name: Functions with Parameters in Bee
              description_student: You've had a little practice using functions with
                parameters. This lesson will continue your practice with Bee!
              description_teacher: This lesson features the bee environment, and continues
                along the concept of functions with parameters from the previous Artist
                stage. Students will practice writing and using functions to follow
                complex paths and collect patterns of nectar and honey.
            Explore Project Ideas:
              name: Explore Project Ideas
              description_student: Time to get some inspiration! These puzzles will
                show you a handful of pre-built games and illustrations to help develop
                your plan for your BIG project.
              description_teacher: "The next five lessons provide an opportunity for
                students to put their coding skills to use in a capstone project.
                This project will help individuals gain experience with coding and
                produce an exemplar to share with peers and loved ones. This is intended
                to be a multi-lesson or multi-week project where students spend time
                brainstorming, learning about the design process, building, and then
                presenting their final work. \n\nIn the explore stage, students will
                be able to view examples of projects in both Artist and Play Lab for
                inspiration. Next, students will learn about the design process and
                how to implement it in their own projects. They will then be given
                the space to create their own project in either Artist or Play Lab
                (this is most likely the longest stage of the project). Students will
                then revise their projects, after testing and extra thought. Finally,
                students will be able to present their finished work to their peers."
            The Design Process:
              name: The Design Process
              description_student: Projects this big take time and plenty planning.
                Here, you will learn about the design process that you'll use to build
                your own creation.
              description_teacher: Over the course of five lessons, students will
                be building up to building a project of their own design using either
                Play Lab or Artist as their programming environment. In this portion
                of the project, students will learn about the design process and how
                to implement it in their own projects. The lesson guide overviewing

            Variables:
              name: Breytur
              description_student: This lesson introduces variables as a way to label
                a number in a program or save a randomly generated value. The class
                begins the lesson with a very basic description of the purpose of
                a variable and practices using the new blocks.  Afterwards, the class
                uses variables to save a random number, allowing the programs to use
                the same random number multiple times.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students learn how to use variables
                to label a number in their program or save a randomly generated value.
                Students begin the lesson with a very basic description of the purpose
                of a variable. Students then complete a level progression that reinforces
                the model of a variable as a way to label or name a number. Students
                use variables to save a random number to see that variables actually
                store or save their values, allowing them to use the same random number
                multiple times in their programs.
            Sprites:
              name: Sprites
              description_student: In order to create more interesting and detailed
                images, the class is introduced to the sprite object. Every sprite
                can be assigned an image to show, and sprites also keep track of multiple
                values about themselves, which will prove useful down the road when
                making animations.  At the end of the lesson, everyone creates a scene
                using sprites.

            The Draw Loop:
              name: The Draw Loop
              description_student: This lesson introduces the draw loop, one of the
                core programming paradigms in Game Lab.  The class combines the draw
                loop with random numbers to manipulate some simple animations with
                dots and then with sprites. Afterwards, everyone uses what they learned
                to update the sprite scene from the previous lesson.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students are introduced to the draw
                loop, one of the core programming paradigms in Game Lab. To begin
                the lesson students look at some physical flipbooks to see that having
                many frames with different images creates the impression of motion.
                Students then watch a video explaining how the draw loop in Game Lab
                helps to create this same impression in their programs. Students combine
                the draw loop with random numbers to manipulate some simple animations
                with dots and then with sprites. At the end of the lesson students
                use what they learned to update their sprite scene from the previous
                lesson.
            The Counter Pattern Unplugged:
              name: The Counter Pattern Unplugged
              description_student: This unplugged lesson explores the underlying behavior
                of variables. Using notecards and string to simulate variables within
                a program, the class implements a few short programs. Once comfortable
                with this syntax, the class uses the same process with sprite properties,
                tracking a sprite's progress across the screen.
              description_teacher: Students explore the underlying behavior of variables
                through an unplugged activity. Using notecards and string to simulate
                variables within a program, students implement a few short programs.
                Once comfortable with this syntax, students use the same process with
                sprite properties, tracking a sprite's progress across the screen.
            Sprite Movement:
              name: Sprite Movement
              description_student: By combining the Draw Loop and the Counter Pattern,
                the class writes programs that move sprites across the screen, as
                well as animate other sprite properties.

            Booleans Unplugged:
              name: Booleans Unplugged
              description_student: This lesson introduces boolean values and logic,
                as well as conditional statements. The class starts by playing a simple
                game of Stand Up, Sit Down in which the boolean (true/false) statements
                describe personal properties (hair or eye color, clothing type, age,
                etc). The class then groups objects based on increasingly complex
                boolean statements, then looks at how conditionals can impact the
                flow of a program.
              description_teacher: |-
                In this lesson, students are introduced to boolean values and logic, as well as conditional statements. The class starts by playing a simple game of Stand Up, Sit Down in which the boolean (true/false) statements describe personal properties (hair or eye color, clothing type, age, etc). This gets students thinking about how they can frame a property with multiple potential values (such as age) with a binary question.

                From there students are provided a group of objects with similar, yet varying, physical properties. With a partner they group those objects based on increasingly complex boolean statements, including compound booleans with AND and OR.

                Finally we reveal Conditionals as a tool to make decisions or impact the flow of a program using boolean statements as input.
            Conditionals:
              name: Skilyrði
              description_student: Hópurinn byrjar á að nota boole-virkja til að bera
                saman gildið í eiginleika kvika við markgildi og nota þann samanburð
                til að ákveða hvenær kvikinn hefur náð tilteknum stað á skjánum, náð
                tiltekinni stærð eða náð öðru tilteknu gildi með því að nota teljaramynstrið.
                Eftir að hafa nota boole-virkja beint til að kanna gildi í eiginleikum
                kvika, bætir hópurinn við ef-yrðingum sem nota samanburð með boole-virkjum
                og skrifar kóða til að vinna úr þessum samanburði.
              description_teacher: Students start by using booleans to compare the
                current value of a sprite property with a target value, using that
                comparison to determine when a sprite has reached a point on the screen,
                grown to a given size, or otherwise reached a value using the counter
                pattern. After using booleans directly to investigate the values or
                sprite properties, students add conditional _if_ statements to write
                code that responds to those boolean comparisons.
            Keyboard Input:
              name: Keyboard Input
              description_student: Following the introduction to booleans and if statements
                in the previous lesson, students are introduced to a new block called
                keyDown() which returns a boolean and can be used in conditionals
                statements to move sprites around the screen. By the end of this lesson
                students will have written programs that take keyboard input from
                the user to control sprites on the screen.
              description_teacher: Following the introduction to booleans and _if_
                statements in the previous lesson, students are introduced to a new
                block called `keyDown()` which returns a boolean and can be used in
                conditionals statements to move sprites around the screen. By the
                end of this lesson students will have written programs that take keyboard
                input from the user to control sprites on the screen.
            Other Forms of Input:
              name: Other Forms of Input
              description_student: The class continues to explore ways to use conditional
                statements to take user input. In addition to the simple keyDown()
                command learned yesterday, the class learns about several other keyboard
                input commands as well as ways to take mouse input.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students continue to explore ways
                to use conditional statements to take user input. In addition to the

            Project - Interactive Card:
              name: Project - Interactive Card
              description_student: In this cumulative project for Chapter 1, the class
                plans for and develops an interactive greeting card using all of the
                programming techniques they've learned to this point.

                sample games. They will then complete a blank project guide where
                they will describe the game's behavior and scope out the variables,
                sprites, and functions they'll need to build. In Code Studio, a series
                of levels prompts them on a general sequence they can use to implement
                this plan. Partway through the process, students will share their
                projects for peer review and will incorporate feedback as they finish
                their game. At the end of the lesson, students will share their completed
                games with their classmates. This project will span multiple classes
                and can easily take anywhere from 3-5 class periods.

              description_student: This lesson covers the purposes that a website
                might serve, both for the users and the creators. The class explores
                a handful of the most-used websites in the United States and discusses
                how each of those sites is useful for users and how it might also
                serve its creators.

                a few exemplar websites made by students from a previous course. Finally
                everyone brainstorms and shares a list of topics and interests to
                include, creating a resource for developing a personal website in

                websites as a means of personal expression and develop a list of topics
                and interests that they would want to include on a personal website.
                To begin the lesson students brainstorm different ways that people
                express and share their interests and ideas. Students then look at
                a few exemplar websites made by students from a previous CS Discoveries
                course to identify ways they are expressing their ideas. Finally students
                brainstorm and share a list of topics and interests they might want
                to include on a personal website which they can reference for ideas

            Intro to HTML:
              name: Kynning á HTML
              description_student: This lesson introduces to HTML as a solution to
                the problem of how to communicate both the content and structure of
                a website to a computer. The lesson begins with a brief unplugged
                activity demonstrating the challenges of effectively communicating
                the structure of a web page. The class looks at an HTML page in Web
                Lab and discusses how HTML tags help solve this problem, then uses
                HTML to write the first web pages of the unit.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students are introduced HTML as
                a solution to the problem of how to communicate both the content and

                the structure of a web page. Students then look at an exemplar HTML
                page in Web Lab and discuss with their classmates how HTML tags help
                solve this problem. Students then write their first HTML. A wrap-up
                discussion helps to solidify the understanding of content vs. structure
                that was developed throughout the lesson.
            Headings:
              name: Headings
              description_student: This lesson continues the introduction to HTML
                tags, this time with headers.  The class practices using header tags
                to create page and section titles and learns how the different header
                elements are displayed by default.  Next, the class plans how to organize
                their content on the personal web pages that will be built across
                the unit and begins the first page of the project.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students continue to use HTML to
                structure text on web pages, this time with headings.  Students learn
                how the different heading elements are displayed by default and practice
                using them to create page and section titles.  Students then start
                to decide how they will organize their content on their own personal
                web pages.  In the last level, students begin the project that they
                will continue to work on throughout the unit.
            Digital Footprint:
              name: Digital Footprint
              description_student: This lesson takes a step back from creating the
                personal website to talk about personal information people choose
                to share digitally.  The class begins by discussing what types of
                information are good to share with other people, then looks at several
                sample social media pages to see what types of personal information
                could be shared intentionally or unintentionally.  Finally, the class
                comes up with a set of guidelines to follow when putting information
                online.
              description_teacher: |-
                As students have recently spent some time thinking about the actual content that will go into their personal website, this lesson takes a step back from the unit-long project (publication of a personal website) to help students articulate what personal information they choose to share digitally and with whom.  It also reinforces the notion that much of the information that they choose to share digitally falls largely out of their control the moment it is released.  \r
                \r
                Students begin by individually identifying appropriate audiences with whom they would be comfortable sharing given pieces of personal information.  They then look at several social media pages to determine what sorts of information people are sharing about themselves or one another.  Last, students reflect on what guidelines they think are appropriate for posting information online.\r
                \r
                The ultimate point of this lesson is not to scare students, but rather to experientially bring students to realizing precisely what level of control they don’t have in releasing information into the web.
            Lists:
              name: Listar
              description_student: This lesson introduces ordered and unordered lists
                and the associated  &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, and &lt;li&gt; HTML tags.  The
                class practices using the tags, then goes back to the personal web
                page project to add a new HTML page that includes the new tags.
              description_teacher: Students are introduced to ordered and unordered
                lists in HTML and work through a few levels in which they use the
                &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, and &lt;li&gt; tags.  They then go back to
                their project, where they add a new HTML page.  Inside the new page,
                they write the HTML to display a recipe, top ten list, or any other
                content that uses the new tags that they have learned.
            Intellectual Property and Images:
              name: Höfundarréttur og Myndir
              description_student: This lesson covers how to use media such as images,
                video, or music created by others a website while respecting the rights
                of the creator of that media. After first studying Creative Commons
                licensing, the class learns how to add images to web pages, and how
                to give proper attribution when doing so.
              description_teacher: |-
                Starting with an discussion of their personal opinions on how others should be allowed to use their work, the class explores the purpose and role of copyright for both creators and users of creative content.  They then move on to an activity exploring the various Creative Commons licenses as a solution to the difficulty in dealing with copyright. \r
                \r
                Finally, with a common understanding of the restrictions of various Creative Commons licenses, students learn how to add images to their web pages using the &lt;img&gt; tag.
            Clean Code and Debugging:
              name: Clean Code and Debugging
              description_student: In this lesson covers common issues that arise
                when designing web pages in HTML. The class will correct errors in
                a sequence of increasingly complex web pages found on Code Studio
                and learn the importance of comments, whitespace, and indentation
                as tools for making web pages easier to read.

                an opportunity to flex their analytical skills in a search for strange
                and unlikely animals.
              description_teacher: This lesson encourages students to think more critically
                about how web searches work and how to find relevant and trustworthy
                information online. After viewing and discussion a video about how
                search engines work, students will search for information about several
                unlikely animals. They'll need to analyze the sites they find for
                reliability in order to identify which of the animals is actually
                a hoax.
            RGB Colors and Classes:

                class first learns how to specify custom colors using RGB (red, green,
                blue) values, then applies these colors to a new Four Seasons web
                page, which uses CSS classes.  Using classes, the class adds more
                styles to the Four Seasons web page, then use them to style their
                personal websites.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students first learn how to specify

              description_teacher: Returning to loops, students learn to draw images
                by looping simple sequences of instructions. In the previous plugged
                lesson, loops were used to traverse a maze and collect treasure. Here,
                loops are creating patterns. At the end of this stage, students will
                be given the opportunity to create their own images using loops.

              description_teacher: Events are a great way to add variety to a pre-written
                algorithm. Sometimes you want your program to be able to respond to
                the user exactly when the user wants it to. That is what events are
                for.

          description: Unit 6 explores the role of hardware platforms in computing
            and how different sensors can provide more effective input and output
            than the traditional keyboard, mouse, and monitor. Using App Lab and Adafruit’s
            Circuit Playground, you’ll develop programs that utilize the same hardware
            inputs and outputs that you see in the smart devices, looking at how a
            simple rough prototype can lead to a finished product. The unit concludes
            with a design challenge to use the Circuit Playground as the basis for
            an innovation of your own design.

                point of view in this lesson on algorithms.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students will relate the concept
                of algorithms back to real-life activities by playing the Dice Race
                game. The goal here is to start building the skills to translate real-world
                situations to online scenarios and vice versa.
            Introduction:
              name: Kynning
              description_student: This fast-paced introduction will give you the
                chance to practice most of the skills that you will need to solve
                the puzzles in this course.
              description_teacher: In this progression, students will begin with an
                introduction (or review depending on the experience of your class)
                of Code.org's online workspace. Students will learn the basic functionality
                of the interface including the `Run`, `Reset`, and `Step` buttons.
                Dragging, deleting, and connecting Blockly blocks is also introduced
                in the beginning video. In the puzzles, students will practice their
                sequencing and debugging skills in Maze and Artist.
            Conditionals:
              name: Skilyrði
              description_student: You will get to tell the computer what to do under
                certain conditions in this fun and challenging series.
              description_teacher: This lesson introduces students to `while` loops
                and `if / else` statements. _While loops_ are loops that continue
                to repeat commands as long as a condition is true. While loops are
                used when the programmer doesn't know the exact number of times the
                commands need to be repeated, but the programmer does know what condition
                needs to be true in order for the loop to continue looping. `If /
                Else` statements offer flexibility in programming by running entire
                sections of code only if something is true, otherwise it runs something
                else.
            Private and Personal Information:
              name: Private and Personal Information
              description_student: The internet is fun and exciting, but it's important
                to stay safe too. This lesson teaches you the difference between information
                that is safe to share and information that is private.
              description_teacher: |-
                Developed by Common Sense Education, this lesson is about the difference between information that is safe to share online and information that is not.

                As students visit sites that request information about their identities, they learn to adopt a critical inquiry process that empowers them to protect themselves and their families from identity theft. In this lesson, students learn to think critically about the user information that some websites request or require. They learn the difference between private information and personal information, as well as how to distinguish what is safe or unsafe to share online.
            Build a Star Wars Game:
              name: Build a Star Wars Game
              description_student: Feel the force as you build your own Star Wars
                game in this lesson.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students will practice using events
                to build a game that they can share online. Featuring R2-D2 and other
                Star Wars characters, students will be guided through events, then
                given space to create their own game.
            'Functions: Songwriting':
              name: 'Functions: Songwriting'
              description_student: Even rockstars need programming skills. This lesson
                will teach you about functions using lyrics from songs.
              description_teacher: One of the most magnificent structures in the computer
                science world is the function. Functions (sometimes called procedures)
                are mini programs that you can use over and over inside of your bigger
                program. This lesson will help students intuitively understand why
                combining chunks of code into functions can be such a helpful practice.
            Functions in Artist:
              name: Functions in Artist
              description_student: Make complex drawings more easily with functions!
              description_teacher: Students will be introduced to using functions
                on Code.org. Magnificent images will be created and modified with
                functions in Artist. For more complicated patterns, students will
                learn about nesting functions by calling one function from inside
                another.
            Functions in Bee:

              description_teacher: This lesson brings together concepts from the previous
                lessons and gives students a chance to think critically about how
                they would solve each problem, but without telling them which concept
                to apply. Students will review basic algorithms, debugging, `repeat`
                loops, conditionals, `while` loops, and functions.
            Build a Play Lab Game:
              name: Build a Play Lab Game
              description_student: Practice making games to share with your friends
                and family.
              description_teacher: This lesson features Play Lab, a platform where
                students can create their own games and have interactions between
                characters and user input. Students will work with events to create
                keyboard controls. This set of puzzles will also loosely guide students
                through game development, but with freedom to add their own ideas.

              name: Explore Project Ideas
              description_student: Here are several games and drawings. Play with
                each of them to get ideas for projects of your own!
              description_teacher: "The next four lessons provide an opportunity for
                students to put their coding skills to use in a capstone project.
                This project will help individuals gain experience with coding and
                produce an exemplar to share with peers and loved ones. Intended to
                be a multi-lesson or multi-week experience, students will spend time
                exploring brainstorming, learning about the design process, building,
                and presenting their final work. \n\nIn the explore stage, students
                will be able to view pre-built examples of projects in both Artist
                and Play Lab for inspiration. Next, students will learn about the
                design process and how to implement it in their own projects. They

                algorithms. As long as you keep an algorithm simple, there are lots
                of ways to use it. However, if you want to make sure everyone produces
                the same outcome, then your algorithm needs more detail. Students
                will learn the difference between a detailed and general algorithm

                that can make them feel angry, hurt, sad, or fearful. They explore
                ways to handle cyberbullying and how to respond in the face of upsetting
                language online.\n\nStudents discuss all the ways they use technology
                for communication and explore the similarities and differences between
                in-person and online communication. Students then brainstorm ways

                how it was made? In these puzzles you will develop a video game of
                your own with friends from Ice Age!
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students are guided through a story
                featuring characters from Ice Age. Students will work with events
                and loops to make characters move on the screen, and will get the
                chance to create their own game or story after the guided levels.

                both can hold valuable things. Here you will learn what variables
                are and the awesome things they can do.'
              description_teacher: Variables are used as placeholders for values such
                as numbers or words. Variables allow for a lot of freedom in programming.
                Instead of having to type out a phrase many times or remember an obscure
                number, computer scientists can use variables to reference them. This
                lesson helps to explain what variables are and how we can use them
                in many different ways. The idea of variables isn't an easy concept
                to grasp, so we recommend allowing plenty of time for discussion at
                the end of the lesson.
            Variables in Artist:

              description_teacher: Students will get further practice with variables
                in this lesson by creating scenes in Play Lab. Students will work
                with user input to set the values of their variables, then get space
                to create their own mini-project with variables.
            For Loop Fun:

                `for` loops!
              description_teacher: 'We know that loops allow us to do things over
                and over again, but now we’re going to learn how to use loops that
                have extra structures built right in. These new structures will allow
                students to create code that is more powerful and dynamic. '

              description_student: Buzz buzz. In these puzzles you will be guiding
                a bee to nectar and honey using `for` loops!
              description_teacher: Featuring Bee, this lesson focuses on for loops
                and using an incrementing variable to solve more complicated puzzles.
                Students will begin by reviewing loops from previous lessons, then
                walked through using for loops to more effectively solve complicated
                problems.
            For Loops in Artist:

                loops, this time with Artist. Students will complete puzzles combining
                the ideas of variables, loops, and for loops to create complex designs.
                At the end, they will have a chance to create their own art in a freeplay
                level.

                In this lesson, you will be learning what parameters are and how they
                make some fantastic songs!
              description_teacher: One of the most magnificent structures in the computer
                science world is the function. Functions (sometimes called procedures)
                are mini programs that you can use over and over inside of your bigger
                program. This lesson will help students intuitively understand why
                combining chunks of code into functions is such a helpful practice,
                and how they can use those structures even when chunks of code are
                slightly different.

                parameters. This lesson will continue your practice with Bee!
              description_teacher: This lesson features the bee environment, and continues
                along the concept of functions with parameters from the previous Artist
                stage. Students will practice writing and using functions to follow
                complex paths and collect patterns of nectar and honey.
