            patterns, trends and possible meanings are important practical skills
            that computer scientists do every day. The data rich world we live in
            also introduces many complex questions related to public policy, law,
            ethics and societal impact. Understanding where data comes from, having
            intuitions about what could be learned or extracted from it, and being
            able to use computational tools to manipulate data and communicate about
            it are the primary skills addressed in the unit.

              description_teacher: Students learn to combine the velocity properties
                of sprites with the counter pattern to create more complex sprite
                movement. In particular students will learn how to simulate gravity,
                make a sprite jump, and allow a sprite to float left or right. In
                the final levels of the Code Studio progression students combine these
                movements to animate and control a single sprite and build a simple
                game in which a character flies around and collects a coin. Students
                are encouraged to make their own additions to the game in the final
                level.
            Collisions:
              name: "Árekstrar"
              description_student: Hópurinn forritar kvika til að eiga samskipti á
                nýjan hátt.  Eftir stutta upprifjun á hvernig isTouching() kubburinn
                var notaður, kannar hópurinn hvaða önnur samskipti kvikar gætu átt.
                Þeir nota síðan isTouching() til að láta einn kvika ýta öðrum yfir
                skjáinn og æfa síðan árekstrarkubbana fjóra (collide, displace, bounce
                og bounceOff).
              description_teacher: Students program their sprites to interact in new
                ways.  After a brief review of how they used the `isTouching` block,
                students brainstorm other ways that two sprites could interact.  They
                then use `isTouching` to make one sprite push another across the screen
                before practicing with the four collision blocks (`collide`, `displace`,
                `bounce`, and `bounceOff`).
            Functions:
              name: Föll
              description_student: This lesson covers functions as a way to organize
                their code, make it more readable, and remove repeated blocks of code.
                The class learns that higher level or more abstract steps make it
                easier to understand and reason about steps, then begins to create
                functions in Game Lab.  At the end of the lesson the class uses these
                skills to organize and add functionality to the final version of their
                side scroller game.
              description_teacher: Students learn how to create functions to organize
                their code, make it more readable, and remove repeated blocks of code.
                An unplugged warmup explores how directions at different levels of
                detail can be useful depending on context. Students learn that higher
                level or more abstract steps make it easier to understand and reason
                about steps. Afterwards students learn to create functions in Game
                Lab. They will use functions to remove long blocks of code from their
                draw loop and to replace repeated pieces of code with a single function.
                At the end of the lesson students use these skills to organize and
                add functionality to the final version of their side scroller game.
            The Game Design Process:
              name: Ferli leikjahönnunar
              description_student: This lesson introduces the process the class will
                use to design games for the remainder of the unit. The class walks
                through through this process in a series of levels. As part of this
                lesson the class also briefly learn to use multi-frame animations
                in Game Lab. At the end of the lesson they have an opportunity to
                make improvements to the game to make it their own.
              description_teacher: This lesson introduces students to the process
                they will use to design games for the remainder of the unit. This
                process is centered around a project guide which asks students to
                define their sprites, variables, and functions before they begin programming
                their game. In this lesson students begin by playing a game on Game
                Lab where the code is hidden. They discuss what they think the sprites,
                variables, and functions would need to be to make the game. They are
                then given a completed project guide which shows one way to implement
                the game. Students are then walked through this process through a
                series of levels. As part of this lesson students also briefly learn
                to use multi-frame animations in Game Lab. At the end of the lesson
                students have an opportunity to make improvements to the game to make
                it their own.
            Using the Game Design Process:
              name: Notkun leikjahönnunarferlisins
              description_student: In this multi-day lesson, the class uses the problem
                solving process from Unit 1 to create a platform jumper game.  After
                looking at a sample game, the class defines what their games will
                look like and uses a structured process to build them.  Finally, the
                class reflects on how the games could be improved, and implements
                those changes.
              description_teacher: In this multi-day lesson, students use the problem
                solving process from Unit 1 to create a platform jumper game.  They
                start by looking at an example of a platform jumper, then define what
                their games will look like.  Next, they use a structured process to
                plan the backgrounds, variables, sprites, and functions they will
                need to implement their game.  After writing the code for the game,
                students will reflect on how the game could be improved, and implement
                those changes.

            Programming for Entertainment:
              name: Programming for Entertainment
              description_student: The class is asked to consider the "problems" of
                boredom and self expression, and to reflect on how they approach those
                problems in their own lives. From there, they will explore how Computer
                Science in general, and programming specifically, plays a role in
                either a specific form of entertainment or as a vehicle for self expression.

            Plotting Shapes:
              name: Plotting Shapes
              description_student: Students explore the challenges of communicating
                how to draw with shapes and use a tool that introduces how this problem
                is approached in Game Lab. The warm up activity quickly demonstrates
                the challenges of communicating position without some shared reference
                point. In the main activity students explore a Game Lab tool that
                allows students to interactively place shapes on Game Lab's 400 by
                400 grid. They then take turns instructing a partner how to draw a
                hidden image using this tool, accounting for many challenges students
                will encounter when programming in Game Lab. Students optionally create
                their own image to communicate before a debrief discussion.

            Shapes and Randomness:
              name: Shapes and Randomness
              description_student: This lesson extends the drawing skills to include
                width and height and introduces the concept of random number generation.
                The class learns to draw with versions of ellipse() and rect() that
                include width and height parameters and to use the background() block
                to fill the screen with color. At the end of the progression the class
                is introduced to the randomNumber() block and uses the new blocks
                to draw a randomized rainbow snake.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students continue to develop their
                drawing skills. At the beginning of the lesson a teacher-led discussion
                connects expanded block functionality (e.g. different sized shapes)
                with the need for more block inputs, or "parameters". Students learn
                to draw with versions of `ellipse()` and `rect()` that include width
                and height parameters. They also learn to use the `background()` block.
                At the end of the progression students are introduced to the `randomNumber()`
                block. Combining all of these skills students will draw a randomized
                rainbow snake at the end of the lesson.
            Variables:
              name: Breytur
              description_student: This lesson introduces variables as a way to label
                a number in a program or save a randomly generated value. The class
                begins the lesson with a very basic description of the purpose of
                a variable and practices using the new blocks.  Afterwards, the class
                uses variables to save a random number, allowing the programs to use
                the same random number multiple times.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students learn how to use variables
                to label a number in their program or save a randomly generated value.
                Students begin the lesson with a very basic description of the purpose
                of a variable. Students then complete a level progression that reinforces
                the model of a variable as a way to label or name a number. Students
                use variables to save a random number to see that variables actually
                store or save their values, allowing them to use the same random number
                multiple times in their programs.
            Sprites:
              name: Sprites
              description_student: In order to create more interesting and detailed
                images, the class is introduced to the sprite object. Every sprite
                can be assigned an image to show, and sprites also keep track of multiple
                values about themselves, which will prove useful down the road when
                making animations.  At the end of the lesson, everyone creates a scene
                using sprites.

            The Draw Loop:
              name: The Draw Loop
              description_student: This lesson introduces the draw loop, one of the
                core programming paradigms in Game Lab.  The class combines the draw
                loop with random numbers to manipulate some simple animations with
                dots and then with sprites. Afterwards, everyone uses what they learned
                to update the sprite scene from the previous lesson.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students are introduced to the draw
                loop, one of the core programming paradigms in Game Lab. To begin
                the lesson students look at some physical flipbooks to see that having
                many frames with different images creates the impression of motion.
                Students then watch a video explaining how the draw loop in Game Lab
                helps to create this same impression in their programs. Students combine
                the draw loop with random numbers to manipulate some simple animations
                with dots and then with sprites. At the end of the lesson students
                use what they learned to update their sprite scene from the previous
                lesson.
            The Counter Pattern Unplugged:
              name: The Counter Pattern Unplugged
              description_student: This unplugged lesson explores the underlying behavior
                of variables. Using notecards and string to simulate variables within
                a program, the class implements a few short programs. Once comfortable
                with this syntax, the class uses the same process with sprite properties,
                tracking a sprite's progress across the screen.
              description_teacher: Students explore the underlying behavior of variables
                through an unplugged activity. Using notecards and string to simulate
                variables within a program, students implement a few short programs.
                Once comfortable with this syntax, students use the same process with
                sprite properties, tracking a sprite's progress across the screen.
            Sprite Movement:
              name: Sprite Movement
              description_student: By combining the Draw Loop and the Counter Pattern,
                the class writes programs that move sprites across the screen, as
                well as animate other sprite properties.
              description_teacher: By combining the Draw Loop and the Counter Pattern,
                students write programs that move sprites across the screen, as well
                as animate other sprite properties.
            Conditionals:
              name: Skilyrði
              description_student: The class starts by using booleans to compare the
                current value of a sprite property with a target value, using that
                comparison to determine when a sprite has reached a point on the screen,
                grown to a given size, or otherwise reached a value using the counter
                pattern. After using booleans directly to investigate the values or
                sprite properties, the class adds conditional if statements to write
                code that responds to those boolean comparisons.

                sprite properties, students add conditional _if_ statements to write
                code that responds to those boolean comparisons.
            Keyboard Input:
              name: Keyboard Input
              description_student: Following the introduction to booleans and if statements
                in the previous lesson, students are introduced to a new block called
                keyDown() which returns a boolean and can be used in conditionals
                statements to move sprites around the screen. By the end of this lesson
                students will have written programs that take keyboard input from
                the user to control sprites on the screen.
              description_teacher: Following the introduction to booleans and _if_
                statements in the previous lesson, students are introduced to a new
                block called `keyDown()` which returns a boolean and can be used in
                conditionals statements to move sprites around the screen. By the
                end of this lesson students will have written programs that take keyboard
                input from the user to control sprites on the screen.
            Other Forms of Input:
              name: Other Forms of Input
              description_student: The class continues to explore ways to use conditional
                statements to take user input. In addition to the simple keyDown()
                command learned yesterday, the class learns about several other keyboard
                input commands as well as ways to take mouse input.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students continue to explore ways
                to use conditional statements to take user input. In addition to the
                simple `keyDown()` command learned yesterday, students will learn
                about several other keyboard input commands as well as ways to take
                mouse input.
            Booleans Unplugged:
              name: Booleans Unplugged
              description_student: This lesson introduces boolean values and logic,
                as well as conditional statements. The class starts by playing a simple
                game of Stand Up, Sit Down in which the boolean (true/false) statements
                describe personal properties (hair or eye color, clothing type, age,
                etc). The class then groups objects based on increasingly complex
                boolean statements, then looks at how conditionals can impact the
                flow of a program.
              description_teacher: |-
                In this lesson, students are introduced to boolean values and logic, as well as conditional statements. The class starts by playing a simple game of Stand Up, Sit Down in which the boolean (true/false) statements describe personal properties (hair or eye color, clothing type, age, etc). This gets students thinking about how they can frame a property with multiple potential values (such as age) with a binary question.

                From there students are provided a group of objects with similar, yet varying, physical properties. With a partner they group those objects based on increasingly complex boolean statements, including compound booleans with AND and OR.

                Finally we reveal Conditionals as a tool to make decisions or impact the flow of a program using boolean statements as input.
            Project - Interactive Card:
              name: Project - Interactive Card
              description_student: In this cumulative project for Chapter 1, the class
                plans for and develops an interactive greeting card using all of the
                programming techniques they've learned to this point.
              description_teacher: In this cumulative project for Chapter 1, students
                plan for and develop an interactive greeting card using all of the

            Project - Design a Game:
              name: Project - Design a Game
              description_student: The class plans and builds original games using
                the project guide from the previous two lessons. Working individually
                or in pairs, the class plans, develops, and gives feedback on the
                games.  After incorporating the peer feedback, the class shares out
                the completed games.
              description_teacher: Students will plan and build their own game using
                the project guide from the previous two lessons to guide their project.
                Working individually or in pairs, students will first decide on the
                type of game they'd like to build, taking as inspiration a set of
                sample games. They will then complete a blank project guide where
                they will describe the game's behavior and scope out the variables,
                sprites, and functions they'll need to build. In Code Studio, a series
                of levels prompts them on a general sequence they can use to implement
                this plan. Partway through the process, students will share their
                projects for peer review and will incorporate feedback as they finish
                their game. At the end of the lesson, students will share their completed

                In this lesson students apply the problem solving process to three different problems in order to better understand the value of each step. They will solve a word search, arrange seating for a birthday party, and plan a trip. The problems grow increasingly complex and poorly defined to highlight how the problem solving process is particularly helpful when tackling these types of problems. The lesson concludes with students reflecting on their experience with the problem solving process. They will justify the inclusion of each step and will brainstorm questions or strategies that can help them better define open-ended problems, as this is often the most critical step.

                This lesson will likely take two class periods or more to complete. The first two problems may fit into a single class period but the third will need to be moved to a second day.

                more obvious physical inputs and outputs (e.g. a keyboard as an input
                or a screen as an output) but later discussions lead students to consider
                less obvious examples (e.g. that a touch screen is both an input and
                output, or the fact that the Internet can serve as both input and
                output). Throughout the lesson the teacher records inputs and outputs
                that are identified on a T-Chart at the front of the room. To conclude
                the lesson students examine common activities they do on a computing

            Processing:

              description_student: This lesson dives deeper into the concept of processing
                that was introduced as part of the definition of a computer.  Pairs
                work together to puta deck of cards in order, a form of processing
                information.  In the end, the class discusses what processing means
                within the context of solving information problems.
              description_teacher: Students complete two unplugged card sorting activities
                to explore the meaning of processing and its relationship to problem-solving.
                The first has few constraints and is used to introduce a high-level
                definition of processing. The next introduces more constraints that
                forces students to develop an algorithm that will always successfully
                process the cards. Students iteratively develop, test, and share their
                algorithms with classmates. A wrap-up discussion has students reflect
                on the different types of problem-solving they used in these activities
                and the value of producing an algorithm to solve a problem.
            Storage:
              name: Vistun
              description_student: This lesson focuses on the storage component of
                the definition of a computer, within the content of processing information.
                The class spends the majority of the lesson developing and sharing
                algorithms to process information, with an emphasis on how much storage
                is needed for any particular algorithm. The lesson concludes with
                a discussion of the importance of storage while processing information.
              description_teacher: Students explore the importance of storage within
                the Input-Storage-Processing-Output model of a computer. The warm-up
                activity asks students to reflect on the types of information they
                have seen computers store in the past, like documents, photographs,
                or videos. The unplugged main activity has students develop an algorithm
                to process a small pile of cards in search of specific cards within
                the deck. Constraints on how students can move the cards force them
                to consider the importance of storage even while they are processing
                the deck. The lesson concludes with a discussion of the two types
                of storage students saw in this lesson and the importance of storage
                while processing information.

                personal website to talk about personal information people choose
                to share digitally.  The class begins by discussing what types of
                information are good to share with other people, then looks at several
                sample social media pages to see what types of personal information
                could be shared intentionally or unintentionally.  Finally, the class
                comes up with a set of guidelines to follow when putting information
                online.
              description_teacher: |-
                As students have recently spent some time thinking about the actual content that will go into their personal website, this lesson takes a step back from the unit-long project (publication of a personal website) to help students articulate what personal information they choose to share digitally and with whom.  It also reinforces the notion that much of the information that they choose to share digitally falls largely out of their control the moment it is released.  \r
                \r
                Students begin by individually identifying appropriate audiences with whom they would be comfortable sharing given pieces of personal information.  They then look at several social media pages to determine what sorts of information people are sharing about themselves or one another.  Last, students reflect on what guidelines they think are appropriate for posting information online.\r
                \r
                The ultimate point of this lesson is not to scare students, but rather to experientially bring students to realizing precisely what level of control they don’t have in releasing information into the web.

                and unlikely animals.
              description_teacher: This lesson encourages students to think more critically
                about how web searches work and how to find relevant and trustworthy
                information online. After viewing and discussion a video about how
                search engines work, students will search for information about several
                unlikely animals. They'll need to analyze the sites they find for
                reliability in order to identify which of the animals is actually
                a hoax.

            Exploring Websites:
              name: Könnun Vefsetra
              description_student: This lesson covers the purposes that a website
                might serve, both for the users and the creators. The class explores
                a handful of the most-used websites in the United States and discusses
                how each of those sites is useful for users and how it might also
                serve its creators.
              description_teacher: Every website has a purpose, a reason someone created
                it and others use it. In this lesson, students will start to consider
                the purposes a website might serve, both for the users and the creators.
                Students will explore a handful of the most-used websites in the United
                States and try to figure out how each of those sites is useful for
                users and how they might also serve their creators.

                people express and share their interests and ideas, then looks at
                a few exemplar websites made by students from a previous course. Finally
                everyone brainstorms and shares a list of topics and interests to
                include, creating a resource for developing a personal website in
                the rest of the unit. '
              description_teacher: In this lesson students investigate ways to use
                websites as a means of personal expression and develop a list of topics
                and interests that they would want to include on a personal website.
                To begin the lesson students brainstorm different ways that people
                express and share their interests and ideas. Students then look at
                a few exemplar websites made by students from a previous CS Discoveries
                course to identify ways they are expressing their ideas. Finally students
                brainstorm and share a list of topics and interests they might want
                to include on a personal website which they can reference for ideas
                as they progress through the unit.
            Intro to HTML:
              name: Kynning á HTML
              description_student: This lesson introduces to HTML as a solution to
                the problem of how to communicate both the content and structure of
                a website to a computer. The lesson begins with a brief unplugged
                activity demonstrating the challenges of effectively communicating
                the structure of a web page. The class looks at an HTML page in Web
                Lab and discusses how HTML tags help solve this problem, then uses
                HTML to write the first web pages of the unit.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students are introduced HTML as
                a solution to the problem of how to communicate both the content and

                unplugged activity demonstrating the challenges of effectively communicating
                the structure of a web page. Students then look at an exemplar HTML
                page in Web Lab and discuss with their classmates how HTML tags help
                solve this problem. Students then write their first HTML. A wrap-up
                discussion helps to solidify the understanding of content vs. structure
                that was developed throughout the lesson.
            Headers:
              name: Fyrirsagnir
              description_student: This lesson continues the introduction to HTML
                tags, this time with headers.  The class practices using header tags
                to create page and section titles and learns how the different header
                elements are displayed by default.  Next, the class plans how to organize
                their content on the personal web pages that will be built across
                the unit and begins the first page of the project.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students continue to use HTML to
                structure text on web pages, this time with headers.  Students learn
                how the different header elements are displayed by default and practice
                using them to create page and section titles.  Students then start
                to decide how they will organize their content on their own personal
                web pages.  In the last level, students begin the project that they
                will continue to work on throughout the unit.
            Lists:

                and the associated  &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, and &lt;li&gt; HTML tags.  The
                class practices using the tags, then goes back to the personal web
                page project to add a new HTML page that includes the new tags.
              description_teacher: Students are introduced to ordered and unordered
                lists in HTML and work through a few levels in which they use the
                &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, and &lt;li&gt; tags.  They then go back to
                their project, where they add a new HTML page.  Inside the new page,
                they write the HTML to display a recipe, top ten list, or any other
                content that uses the new tags that they have learned.

                video, or music created by others a website while respecting the rights
                of the creator of that media. After first studying Creative Commons
                licensing, the class learns how to add images to web pages, and how
                to give proper attribution when doing so.
              description_teacher: "Starting with an exploration of the song \"Happy
                Birthday\" and its history of copyright protection, the class explores
                the purpose and role of copyright for both creators and users of creative
                content. After a brief discussion about the purpose of copyright,
                we move on to an activity exploring the various Creative Commons licenses
                as a solution to the difficulty in dealing with copyright. \n\nFinally,
                with a common understanding of the restrictions of various Creative
                Commons licenses, students will learn how to add images to their web
                pages using the &lt;img&gt; tag."

            Through a series of design challenges, you will learn how to better understand
            the needs of others while developing a solution to a problem. The second
            half of the unit consists of an iterative team project, during which teams
            have the opportunity to identify a need that they care about, prototype
            solutions both on paper and in App Lab, and test solutions with real users
            to get feedback and drive further iteration.

                might have been designed with needs of specific users in mind, students
                can begin to see how taking a user-centered approach to designing
                products (both physical and digital) can make those products more
                useful and usable.

              description_student: In this lesson students will use feedback from

                to develop improvements to the user interface of that paper prototype.
                The lesson begins with a reflection on the fact that designers need
                to translate human needs with technology into changes to the user
                interface or experience. Students are then given a collection of feedback
                and requests from users of the app from the previous lesson. In groups
                students categorize the feedback and identify ways the needs expressed
                in the feedback could be met by changes to the interface of the app.
                Then in groups students will implement some of these changes to meet
                one of the needs they identified.

                end user and ask questions to better inform their design.

          description: Unit 6 explores the role of hardware platforms in computing
            and how different sensors can provide more effective input and output
            than the traditional keyboard, mouse, and monitor. Using App Lab and Adafruit’s
            Circuit Playground, you’ll develop programs that utilize the same hardware
            inputs and outputs that you see in the smart devices, looking at how a
            simple rough prototype can lead to a finished product. The unit concludes
            with a design challenge to use the Circuit Playground as the basis for
            an innovation of your own design.

              description_teacher: To kick off the final unit of this course, students
                will do some research into interesting innovations in computing. This
                lesson will expose students to wider variety of computing form factors
                (what a computer looks like) and fields that are impacted by computing.
                Later in this unit students will look back on the devices they encountered
                in this lesson as they develop their own physical computing devices.

                can take input from a user, and learn more about the event-driven
                programming model used in App Lab.
              description_teacher: In preparation for delving deeper into programming
                with App Lab, students will explore how a handful of different programs
                written in both Game Lab and App Lab handle taking input from the
                user. After comparing and contrasting the approaches they saw in the
                example apps, students group up to act out the two different models
                for input (conditionals in an infinite and asynchronous events) to
                gain a better understanding of how they work.

                learned about creating apps in App Lab from Unit 4 in order to prepare
                for a return to App Lab in this unit. This review should be modified
                to best meet the needs of your students and their experience and familiarity
                with programming in App Lab. In addition to the review the students
                will also experiment with a variety of new event types that they likely

                to write programs that use the Circuit Playground for output. After
                first inspecting the board visually and hypothesizing possibly functionalities,
                students move online where they will learn to write applications that
                blink an LED and make noise with a buzzer.

                loop repeats, and other code (such as event handlers) can be run between
                iterations of the loop. This allows us to create interesting animations
                that repeat infinitely, while still allowing other code to run alongside
                it.

                Þeir vinna síðan í litlum hópum við að búa til kerfi sem getur geymt
                hvaða staf stafrófsins sem er með aðeins einum bunka af spjöldum.
                Á hverju spjaldi er ein af 6 mögulegum teikningum (6 dýr, 6 litir,
                o. s. frv.) þannig að nemendur verða að nota fleiri en eitt spjald
                til að tákna hvern staf stafrófsins. Nemendur búa til skilaboð með
                kerfi sínu og prófa með öðrum hópum til að tryggja að kerfið virki
                eins og til er ætlast. Í samantekt ræða nemendur um kosti og galla
                hvers kerfis. Þeir ræða hvað er sameiginlegt með kerfum sem virkuðu
                og uppgötva að það eru margar mögulegar lausnir á þessu verkefni og
                að það sem skiptir máli er ekki endilega kerfið sjálft heldur að allir

                images) to decode information in a record.  After seeing a series
                of bits and being asked to decode them, students are introduced to
                the idea that in order to understand binary information, they must
                understand both the system that is being used and the meaning of the
                information encoded.  They then decode a record representing a pet
                based on a given structure.

                their perfect day using the binary representation systems they've
                learned in this chapter. Students will first write a short description
                of their perfect day and then review with a partner to identify the
                key pieces of information they think a computer could capture. As
                a class students will decide how a punch card of bytes of information
                will be interpreted to represent those pieces of information. Students
                will then use the ASCII, binary number, and image formats they have
                learned to represent their perfect days. Students then trade punch
                cards and try to decipher what the other student's perfect day is

                with data based on some problems designed to be familiar to middle
                school students. Students work in groups discussing how they would
                use the data presented to make a decision before the class discusses
                their final choices. Not all questions have right answers and in some
                cases students can and should decide that they should collect more
                data. The lesson concludes with a discussion of how different people
                could draw different conclusions from the same data, or how collecting
                different data might have affected the decisions they made.

                of data, including cleaning and visualizing raw data sets.  Students
                first look at the how presenting data in different ways can help people
                to understand it better.  They then visualize their own raw data set,
                in the context of a pizza topping survey, deciding what to do with
                data that does not easily fit into the visualization scheme that they
                have chosen.  Last, students look at what parts of this process can
                be automated, and what need a human to make decisions.

              description_student: In this lesson students look at a simple example
                of how a computer could be used to complete essentially every step
                of the data problem solving process. To begin students are given the
                clean data they collected about their ice cream preferences. They
                use a spreadsheet to visualize this data using simple charts and discuss
                in groups the decision they would make with this data. Students then
                create rules, or an algorithm, that a computer could use to make this
                decision automatically. Groups share their rules and what choices
                their rules would make with the class data. They then use their rules
                on data from another class to reinforce the fact that the rules they
                create should be useful for any data set. The lesson concludes with
                a discussion about the benefits and drawbacks of using computers to
                automate the data problem solving process.

              name: Problem Solving with Big Data
              description_student: In this lesson, students look at how data is collected
                and used by a organizations to solve problems in the real world. The
                lesson begins with a quick review of the data problem solving process
                they have explored in this unit. Then students are presented three
                scenarios that could be solved using data and they brainstorm the
                types of data they would want to solve them and how they could collect
                the data. Each problem is designed to reflect a real-world service
                that exists. After brainstorming students will watch a video about
                a real-world service and will record notes about what data is collected
                by the real-world service and how it is used. At the end of the lesson
                students record whether data was provided actively by a user, was
                recorded passively, or is collected by sensors.

                problem. Students will follow a project guide to complete this multi-day
                activity. In the first several steps students brainstorm problems,
                perform simple research, and define a problem of their choosing. They
                will then decide what kind of data they would want to collect, how
                it could be collected, and how it could be used. Students will perform
                a peer review and make any necessary updates to their project before
                preparing a presentation to their classmates.

                turn bits "on" or "off" by turning cards face up and face down, then
                observe the numbers that result from these different patterns.  Eventually,
                student extend the pattern to a generic 4-bit system.

              description_student: Students review the concept of binary numbers,
                and discuss that they need to know the bit-length of each number in
                order to decode a series of bits.  They then made a flippy-do, a paper
                manipulative that will help them to encode and decode 8-bit numbers
                (0-255).  After practicing with the flippy-do, students discuss how
                they could extend that standardization to the other types of data.
