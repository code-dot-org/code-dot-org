        text: ¡Bienvenido a tu primera hora de código! Vamos a sumergirnos bien en
          tu primera experiencia de programación.
      2:
        image: notes/hoc1_2.jpg
        text: Usaremos Blockly, un lenguaje de programación visual donde puedes arrastrar
          y soltar bloques para escribir código.
      3:
        image: notes/hoc1_3.jpg
        text: La mayoría del código se escribe a mano, en cambio Blockly es visual.
          Cada bloque corresponde a una línea de código "real".
      4:
        image: notes/hoc1_4.jpg
        text: Aprenderás los fundamentos de la informática, los conceptos que se utilizan
          en cualquier lugar, desde hacer aplicaciones hasta controlar el Mars rover.
      5:
        image: notes/hoc1_5.jpg
        text: Un programa es un conjunto de instrucciones que tu ordenador sigue.
      6:
        image: notes/hoc1_6.jpg
        text: El objetivo de tu primer programa es guiar un Angry Bird a través de
          un laberinto para golpear al cerdo verde.
      7:
        image: notes/hoc1_7.jpg
        text: El lado izquierdo es el laberinto donde se ejecuta tu programa. Las
          instrucciones para cada rompecabezas están debajo del laberinto.
      8:
        image: notes/hoc1_8.jpg
        text: La barra de herramientas del medio contiene los comandos para el Angry
          Bird. Puedes usarlos para construir tu código.
      9:
        image: notes/hoc1_9.jpg
        text: A la derecha está tu área de trabajo donde podrás arrastrar los bloques
          del cuadro de herramientas para construir tu programa. Para eliminar un
          bloque, arrástralo a la papelera que se encuentra en la esquina.
      10:
        image: notes/hoc1_10.jpg
        text: Cada bloque es una instrucción. Si arrastras el bloque "avanzar" a tu
          espacio de trabajo y oprimes el botón "Ejecutar Programa", el pájaro se
          mueve una casilla en el laberinto.
      11:
        image: notes/hoc1_11.jpg
        text: Para hacer más de una acción, puedes arrastrar muchos bloques en tu
          espacio de trabajo y adjuntarlos juntos. El pájaro hará las acciones de
          arriba hacia abajo.
      12:
        image: notes/hoc1_12.jpg
        text: Si ejecutas un programa y quieres arreglarlo e intentar de nuevo, presiona
          el botón "Reiniciar".

        text: Hola, me llamo JR! Cada equipo de coches de carrera necesita programadores
          de computadoras para ganar. Ellos analizan datos del coche para hacerlo
          más rápido.
      2:
        image: notes/stage5_2.jpg
        text: En estos rompecabezas, serás un artista que dibuja una línea detrás
          de ellos dondequiera que vayan.
      3:
        image: notes/stage5_3.jpg
        text: Este bloque dice "avanzar 100 pixeles". Los pixeles son pequeños puntos
          en tu pantalla.
      4:
        image: notes/stage5_4.jpg
        text: Este bloque dice "girar a la derecha 90 grados". Esto girará a tu artista
          la misma cantidad como los bloques "girar" en los rompecabezas laberinto.
      5:
        image: notes/stage5_5.jpg
        text: Haga clic en la flecha en cualquiera de estos bloques para cambiar la
          cantidad que el artista se mueve hacia adelante o gira. Juega para familiarizarte
          con estos nuevos bloques.

        text: Tienes que ayudarla a quitar todos los montones de tierra y rellenar
          todos los huecos.
      3:
        image: notes/stage9_3.jpg
        text: Los nuevos bloques eliminan una palada llena de tierra de un montón
          y rellanan  con una palada de tierra un hueco.
      4:
        image: notes/stage9_4.jpg
        text: Los montones y los huecos son de diferente tamaño así que tienes que
          decir al granjero cuantas palas debe usar.
    flappy_intro:
      1:
        image: notes/flappy01.jpg
        text: Hola, ¡Soy Katie! Una de las cosas más excitantes de la computación
          es que un programa de ordenador puede ser interactivo.
      2:
        image: notes/flappy02.jpg
        text: Siempre que alguien hace click, pulsa o teclea en un ordenador o teléfono
          genera un EVENTO, y hay un código que decide qué ejecutar cuando ocurre
          un EVENTO.
      3:
        image: notes/flappy03.jpg
        text: 'Por ejemplo, tienes un CONTROLADOR DE EVENTOS que dice "cuando se hace
          clic en el ratón, reproduce un sonido" '
      4:
        image: notes/flappy04.jpg
        text: ¿Has oído del juego FlappyBird? Mediante el uso de controladores de
          eventos, vamos a aprender a programar nuestra propia versión personalizada
          de FlappyBird!
      5:
        image: notes/flappy05.jpg
        text: El código que escribirás consiste de arrastrar y soltar bloques que
          representan los comandos de la computadora. Sin que puedas verlo, cada uno
          de estos bloques está representado por código real.
      6:
        image: notes/flappy06.jpg
        text: 'Si echas un vistazo en el espacio de trabajo, hay algunos bloques verdes
          que son rellenados por ti - son "los controladores de eventos" '
      7:
        image: notes/flappy07.jpg
        text: Si deseas que el pájaro ALETEE cuando haces CLIC en el ratón, puedes
          hacerlo uniendo el bloque "ALETEAR" al manejador de eventos adecuado, y
          ahora en tu juego cada vez que haces clic en el ratón, el pájaro aleteará.
      8:
        image: notes/flappy08.jpg
        text: En cada puzzle de esta actividad te presentamos nuevos tipos de eventos
          como bloques verdes en el espacio de trabajo, tu puedes decidir los bloques
          apropiados para agregar en respuesta a esos eventos.
      9:
        image: notes/flappy09.jpg
        text: Cuando ves un menú desplegable como este, significa que puedes cambiar
          los ajustes - como qué sonido usar cuando flappy caiga al suelo.
      10:
        image: notes/flappy10.jpg
        text: En el puzzle final serás capaz de crear tu propio juego y compartirlo
          con tus amigos. ¡Que te diviertas!
    loop_times:
      1:
        image: notes/hoc2_1.jpg
        text: Hola, soy Mark! Aprendamos acerca de las iteraciones. Usando iteraciones
          puedes decirle a una computadora que repita una y otra vez cualquier conjunto
          de acciones, miles o incluso millones de veces.
      2:
        image: notes/hoc2_2.jpg
        text: En este puzzle, queremos que el pájaro se mueva hacia adelante 5 espacios
          para llegar al cerdo.
      3:
        image: notes/hoc2_3.jpg
        text: Podemos usar el nuevo bloque "repetir" para ayudarnos.
      4:
        image: notes/hoc2_4.jpg
        text: En lugar arrastrar 5 bloques "avanzar"...
      5:
        image: notes/hoc2_5.jpg
        text: Podemos poner el bloque "avanzar" dentro del bloque "repetir" y escribir
          un número en el bloque para decirle cuántas veces repetirlo.
      6:
        image: notes/hoc2_6.jpg
        text: 'Y esto es importante: puedes poner más de un comando dentro de un bloque
          "repetir".'
      7:
        image: notes/hoc2_7.jpg
        text: ¡Disfruta usando tu nuevo bloque "repetir"!
    loop_until:
      1:
        image: notes/hoc3_1.jpg
        text: Hola, soy Chris. Antes de unirme a los Miami Heat, fui a Georgia Tech
          a estudiar Ciencias de la Computación. Vamos a probar nuestro nuevo bloque,
          el bloque "repetir hasta".
      2:
        image: notes/hoc3_2.jpg
        text: ¿Qué sucedería si no supiéramos cuanto debería moverse el pájaro para
          llegar al cerdo?
      3:
        image: notes/hoc3_3.jpg
        text: Si ponemos un bloque "avanzar" dentro del bloque "repetir hasta" , el
          pájaro avanzará HASTA que alcance al cerdo (o choque con una pared).
      4:
        image: notes/hoc3_4.jpg
        text: Y esto es importante; así como antes, podemos poner múltiples bloques
          dentro del bloque "repetir hasta" y todo ello se repetirá.
    if:
      1:
        image: notes/hoc4_1.jpg
        text: '¡Hola, soy Bill! Aprendamos un nuevo concepto fundamental: las declaraciones
          "si". A través de ellas las computadoras toman decisiones.'
      2:
        image: notes/hoc4_2.jpg
        text: Tu mismo usas declaraciones "sí", "If", diariamente.  Antes de salir
          afuera cada mañana, dices "sí", "IF", lloviera afuera, yo me pondría una
          chubasquero.
      3:
        image: notes/hoc4_3.jpg
        text: Podemos decirle al zombie que compruebe si hay un camino a la izquierda,
          y si encuentra un camino a la izquierda, podemos hacerlo girar en esa dirección.
      4:
        image: notes/hoc4_4.jpg
        text: Para escribir el código para esto, vamos a sacar nuestro bloque "si"
          y colocaremos un bloque "gira a la izquierda" en su interior.
      5:
        image: notes/hoc4_5.jpg
        text: Ahora, si ponemos un bloque "avanzar" encima de este, y un bloque "repetir"
          alrededor de todo, cada vez que el zombie se mueva, el comprobará si hay
          un camino a la izquierda y girará. El comando "repetir" es crítico, para
          comprobar si tiene que girar en cada paso.
      6:
        image: notes/hoc4_6.jpg
        text: Las declaraciones "si" son muy importantes en las ciencias de la computación.
          Uno de los primeros programas que escribí era un juego de tic-tac-toe, y
          había una declaración "Si" que decía que si la otra persona está a punto
          de ganar, bloquea el lugar que le permite ganar.
      7:
        image: notes/hoc4_7.jpg
        text: ¡Diviértete cuando uses el bloque "if" (si)!
    if_else:

        image: notes/hoc5_1.jpg
        text: Hola, mi nombre es Saloni. Yo uso la informática para ayudar a resolver
          problemas en salud y medicina. Vamos a aprender acerca del bloque "si sino".
          Se parece al bloque "si", pero tiene una parte extra al final que dice "sino".
      2:
        image: notes/hoc5_2.jpg
        text: Si pongo el bloque "avanzar" en el lugar donde dice "hacer" y un bloque
          "girar a la izquierda" donde dice "sino" el zombie va a elegir entre dos
          opciones. Si hay un camino adelante, el zombie va a avanzar, y SINO (si
          no hay un camino adelante), el zombie va a girar hacia la izquierda.
      3:
        image: notes/hoc5_3.jpg
        text: Al igual que el bloque "si", podemos poner el bloque "si sino" dentro
          de un bloque "repetir" para que el zombie siga moviéndose y el bloque "si
          sino" seguirá comprobando si hay espacio para girar.
      4:
        image: notes/hoc5_4.jpg
        text: ¡Ahora llevemos a esos zombies a donde pertenecen!
    if_else_scrat:
      1:
        image: notes/saloni_ifelse_scrat1.jpg
        text: Una instrucción si-sino es una decisión entre dos cosas. Vamos a ver
          cómo podemos utilizar una instrucción si-sino con nuestro amigo Scrat la
          ardilla.
      2:
        image: notes/saloni_ifelse_scrat2.jpg
        text: Este bloque se ve igual que el bloque "si", pero hay una pieza extra
          en la parte inferior que dice "sino". Si ponemos un bloque "avanzar" donde
          dice "hacer" y un bloque "girar a la izquierda" donde dice "sino", eso significa
          que la ardilla Scrat avanzará si hay un camino delante. Si no hay un camino
          a seguir, Scrat girará a la izquierda.
      3:
        image: notes/saloni_ifelse_scrat3.jpg
        text: Es tomar una decisión y hacer una de las dos acciones en base a esa
          decisión. Y al igual que los bloques "si", puedes poner bloques "si-sino"
          dentro de bloques "repetir".
      4:

        text: '!Hola! soy Brina, una ingeniera de Instagram. Una función es un conjunto
          de líneas de código que quieres usar una y otra vez, así que en vez de escribir
          ese código cada vez, puedes usar solo un bloque.'
      2:
        image: notes/stage13_2.jpg
        text: Vamos a aprender cómo definir funciones. Las definiciones de funciones
          tienen una estrella en la esquina. El nombre de la función está escrito
          en la línea superior.
      3:
        image: notes/stage13_3.jpg
        text: Los bloques que se encuentran dentro de la definición nos dicen qué
          hace. Así que esta definición de función se llama "rellena 5" y está formada
          por un bloque "repetir" y un bloque "rellenar".
      4:
        image: notes/stage13_4.jpg
        text: La definición se encuentra en el espacio de trabajo, pero nuestro agricultor
          no ejecutará la función hasta que arrastremos el bloque "llenar 5" desde
          la categoría de funciones.
      5:
        image: notes/stage13_5.jpg
        text: '¡Volvamos a hacer divertidas las funciones! '
    loop_while:

        text: '¡Hola! soy Makinde. Vamos a aprender acerca del bloque "mientras". '
      2:
        image: notes/stage9_6.jpg
        text: El "bloque mientras que (While)" hará todo lo que pones en su interior
          mientras la declaración en la parte superior es verdadera.
      3:
        image: notes/stage9_7.jpg
        text: Por ejemplo, si la granjera está sobre un montón, continuará eliminando
          una palada llena mientras(WHILE) quede tierra debajo de ella.

          películas incluyendo Shrek.'
      2:
        image: notes/stage11_2.jpg
        text: Esta es nuestra nueva iteración "contador". Realizará acciones una y
          otra ves y puedes hacer que las acciones cambien un poco cada vez.
      3:
        image: notes/stage11_3.jpg
        text: En este ejemplo, nuestra iteración "contador" dice "cuenta con un contador
          de 50 a 90 de 10 en 10" y dentro de ella tenemos un bloque "dibuja un cuadrado".
          Arrastra el bloque "contador" desde la sección "Variables" al sitio "longitud".
      4:
        image: notes/stage11_4.jpg
        text: Esto significa que nuestro artista dibujará un cuadrado que tiene lados
          de 50 píxeles de longitud, luego agregará 10 para dibujar un cuadrado con
          lados de 60 píxeles de longitud, Después continuará agregando 10 para dibujar
          cuadrados hasta que alcance 90. Así que tendremos cuadrados de 50, 60, 70,
          80 y 90.

        text: ¿Qué pasa si queremos dibujar un montón de triángulos y sus lados tienen
          que ser de longitudes diferentes?
      3:
        image: notes/stage15_3.jpg
        text: Podemos escribir a mano ese código o podemos usar una función con parámetros.
      4:
        image: notes/stage15_4.jpg
        text: Para hacer esto, haz clic en la estrella azul sobre la definición de
          la función "dibuja un triángulo". Después arrastra "nombre de entrada" en
          el bloque "entrada".
      5:
        image: notes/stage15_5.jpg
        text: Después si escribes "longitud" en el lugar que dice "x" y presionas
          "Enter" crearás una entrada longitud para tu función.
      6:
        image: notes/stage15_6.jpg
        text: Después haz clic en la estrella. Ahora, haz clic en la categoría de
          las variables y arrastrar el bloque "longitud" dentro del bloque "avanzar"
          de la definición de tu función. Y arrastra hacia afuera el antiguo bloque
          número.
      7:
        image: notes/stage15_7.jpg
        text: Para usar tu función con parámetros, haz clic en la categoría funciones
          y arrastra tu función "dibuja un triángulo con longitud".
      8:
        image: notes/stage15_8.jpg

        text: En la próxima hora, vas a aprender lo básico para poder programar. La
          programación tradicional es generalmente en texto escrito, pero usaremos
          Blockly, que utiliza bloques visuales que puedes arrastrar y soltar para
          escribir programas. De esta forma incluso aprenden las bases los estudiantes
          universitarios. Pero en realidad, todavía estás generando código.

          block into the "repeat" block and hit "Run" to see if you got it right.
          Congratulations, you got it!

          write for a computer. Programs are really good for that but they're also
          helpful in other places. You can make your own game or even program a robot
          to do things for you.

          you work as a team. Why should two people use one computer? Because two
          heads are better than one. In pair programming you and your partner are
          going to sit down together at one computer and you are both going to work
          on the same project.

        text: In pair programming, one person is the driver and the other person is
          the navigator, just like driving a car. The driver sits at the computer
          and is the one using the keyboard and mouse or touchscreen and controlling
          the main actions of the computer. The other person is the navigator. The
          navigator helps the driver by answering the driver's questions and pointing
          out potential problems or mistakes.

        text: Communication is key to successful pair programming. No insults, be
          respectful, don't be a bossy navigator, because nobody likes a backseat
          driver. You and your partner should always be talking. The driver can explain
          what she or he is doing. And the navigator can help suggest what to do next.
      4:
        image: notes/C1_pair_programming_4.png
        text: The navigator should be thinking about the big picture and the driver

        text: This lesson is called planting a seed and it's going to help us understand
          algorithms. Algorithms are specific instructions that explain the order
          in which to do something. Even everyday things like eating breakfast or
          brushing your teeth are algorithms that require small steps to get a job
          done.

        text: Computers can be really smart but they can only understand you if you
          tell them exactly what you want step by step. The great thing about algorithms
          is that if you follow the instructions in order, you can do something that
          you didn't know how to do ahead of time. It's like following a recipe.

          order.

        text: Now, it's time for you to see if your algorithm works. Follow the steps
          in the algorithm very carefully. Are they in the correct order? Did you
          succeed in planting a seed by following the algorithm? It's like programming
          with pictures!

        text: When we want to make chocolate, there are many big steps to that process
          and each of those big steps has a set of smaller steps and there are different
          recipes or algorithms depending on how we want the chocolate to taste. Each
          step is important, even the small ones, so that without one step, the rest
          of them cannot be completed. Creating algorithms that others can understand
          is really important. That's why each step has to be written down so that
          no matter who does it, the result is the same.

          a move forward command five times in order to advance the bird one step
          each time to the pig or you can just tell the computer to move forward once,
          and then tell it to repeat that five times and it'll do the same thing.

        text: One more thing is you can put as many commands as you want inside the

          we have a set of robots, we can say that the first robot is the 1s place
          and the second robot is the 2s place, the third robot is the 4s place and
          so on. That's how you represent a binary number. The robots will do it with
          their binary eyes and count it out for you.

        text: An algorithm is a list of instructions for completing a task. We'll
          follow this set of instructions to make the bowl. Algorithms are really
          helpful when you need someone else to understand how to do something.
      3:
        image: notes/C2_graph_paper_3.png
        text: If you're writing an algorithm for a computer, you have to break it
          down to little tiny steps. So finish this row and go to the next, then the
          next one, and you'll be done.

          recreate that same piece again, or I can teach someone else to do it. Put
          the glass in the kiln, fuse it together, follow the rest of the instructions
          to make the bowl. Algorithms give you a road map for getting something done.

          we are programming our artist. We already have some blocks out on our stage
          but they are just there to get us started.
      2:
        image: notes/C2_artist_loops_2.png
        text: To loop those blocks four times to draw the whole square, we just drag
          out the repeat block and put the moveforward and turn right blocks inside
          the repeat block. When we hit run, the artist will repeat those steps four
          times to complete the square.
    C2_bee_loops:
      1:

        text: A loop is a repetition of activity. Going into a hive to inspect, I
          look at a frame, and then I put it back. I repeat that same activity multiple
          times. It's looping around, doing the same activity multiple times.
      2:
        image: notes/C2_bee_loops_2.png
        text: This is the repeat block. Whatever you put inside the repeat block will
          repeat those actions the number of times that you tell it to. For example,
          in this level, rather than drag out move forward and get nectar three times,
          we're going to just drag them out once each and repeat the action three
          times. That made it easy!

        text: Usually programming is all in text but we'll use Blockly which uses
          visual blocks that you drag and drop to write programs. Under the hood,
          you're still creating code. To start off, we're going to build code for
          a program that will help this Angry Bird move through a maze to get to the
          evil pigs that stole its eggs.
      2:
        image: notes/C2_maze_intro_2.png
        text: Blockly is split into three main parts. On the left is the bird's maze,
          where your program will run. The instructions for each level are written
          below the maze. This middle area is the toolbox and each of these blocks
          is a command that the bird can understand. The white space on the right
          is called the workspace and this is where we'll build our program.
      3:

        text: If I drag the move block to our work space and press "Run", what happens?
          The bird moves forward one box on the grid. And what if I want the bird
          to do something after it moves forward one box? I can add another block
          to our program.
      4:

        text: I'm going to choose the "turn right" block and I'll drag it under my
          move block until the yellow arrow appears. Then I'll drop it and the two
          blocks will snap together. When I press "Run" again,  the bird will perform
          the commands that are stacked from top to bottom on our work space.
      5:

        text: If you ever want to delete a block, just remove it from the stack and
          drag it to the trash can. After you've hit run, you can always hit the reset
          button to get the bird back to the start. Now let's get those pigs!

        text: Today we're gonna make, create, and test an algorithm for a paper airplane.
          But first, we need to break this big project into easy to follow small steps.
          For making a paper airplane, we need to decide what steps to take and in
          what order to take them.
      3:

        text: You'll create your algorithm by first cutting apart the pictures. Next,
          you'll select the 6 pictures that show the steps needed to make a paper
          airplane and arrange those pictures in the correct order. After you have
          everything in order, you will trade algorithms with another student team
          to test out the algorithm to see if the algorithm works. A well designed
          algorithm is super important to making the best paper airplane.

        text: When we want to make chocolate, there are many big steps to that process.
          And each of those big steps has its own set of smaller steps. And there
          are different recipes, or algorithms, depending on how we want the chocolate
          to taste. Each step is important, even the small ones. So without one step,
          the rest of them cannot be completed. Creating algorithms that others can
          understand is really important. That's why each step has to be written down,
          so no matter who does it, the result is the same.

          tried another back handspring on the beam with my new hand position, and
          I stuck it! I was really glad I debugged my back  handspring. We figured

        text: One thing that computers are really good at is repeating commands. As
          a person, you'd get really bored if you had to do the same thing lots of
          times in a row. But a computer can do the same thing millions or even billions
          of times, and not get bored and be able to carry that out really well.

        text: So for example if I wanted to wish everyone on Facebook a happy birthday
          by sending them an email, it might take me more than a century to actually
          write out all of those emails to everyone. But with just a few lines of
          code, I can have a system send an email to everyone on Facebook wishing
          them a happy birthday. So that's what loops are, and why they're valuable,
          and something that computers can do very well.
      3:
        image: notes/C2_zuck_repeat_loop_3.png
        text: In this example your goal is going to be to move the bird to get the
          pig.  Now we're gonna be able to use the "repeat" block in order to be able
          to do this very easily. You can either do this by giving the computer a
          "move forward" command five times in order to advance the bird one step
          each time to the pig.
      4:
        image: notes/C2_zuck_repeat_loop_4.png
        text: Or you can just tell the computer to "move forward" once, and then tell
          it to "repeat" that 5 times, and it will do the same thing. So in order
          to do this you drag your "move forward" command, and then you put it inside
          the "repeat" block.And you can click on it and tell it how many times you
          want to repeat the block to tell it how many steps you want it to take forward.
      5:
        image: notes/C2_zuck_repeat_loop_5.png
        text: Now one more thing is you can put as many commands as you want inside
          the "repeat" block. So in this example you're telling it to move forward
          and turn left, which it will do five times. All right good job and have
          fun!

          a computer how to do an action, you can call that function again. You give
          it a name and then you can call it. That's really like extending the language.
      2:
        image: notes/C3_artist_functions_2.png
        text: In the program we built, we learned how to draw a square by moving and
          turning four times. We can take that function and give it a name, draw a
          square, so that any time we want to do that, we simply say draw a square
          and it will go back and invoke that function, that code. It will get done
          for us. We've added that concept to our programming language.

        text: To move around the canvas, you'll use the move forward block. Here the
          move forward block says move forward by 100 pixels. When we hit run, what
          happens? The artist moves forward a certain amount and that amount is 100
          pixels. Pixels are basically very tiny squares on your computer screen.
      4:

        text: The other block we have in this puzzle says turn right by 90 degrees.
          And when we drag that out that makes our artist turn a certain amount. So
          you can play around with how far you want the artist to turn. This is a
          90 degree turn.
      5:

          learned these really basic moves, you learn new moves and put together these
          building blocks, like a pick and roll or give and go. You can then go from
          there to do more complex plays. Once you learn that play and give it a name,

          We all work together to create a piece of software that actually creates
          an image, creates the final image that you see on screen. That's a tool
          that artists and other developers can use as part of their teamwork and
          their process to be able to create the images that they want on screen.

        text: This lesson is called dice race. Almost everyone likes to play computer
          games. Have you ever thought about how computer programmers turn the steps
          of a game into a program? The first step in creating computer games and
          in solving any problem requires thinking and planning.
      2:

        text: The thinking step of problem solving produces an algorithm, which is
          a step by step plan for solving a problem or finishing a task. In this lesson,
          you'll create an algorithm for a dice race game. Then you'll ask your friends
          to try out your plan to see if they can follow the steps to play the game.
          After the programmer is sure the steps are correct, it's time to translate
          the algorithm into a program with language that the computer can understand.
      3:
        image: notes/C3_dice_race_3.png
        text: Almost everything we do every day requires an algorithm, a list of steps
          you can follow to finish a task. Think about getting ready for school or
          planning a fun day with your friends or fixing a snack. To complete any
          of those tasks, you'll need to break it down into smaller steps and sometimes
          the steps must be in a specific order.

          get out of the cabinet first. But you can't spread the peanut butter until
          you open the jar. Computers need algorithms and programs to show them how
          to do even simple things that we can do without thinking about it.
      5:
        image: notes/C3_dice_race_5.png
        text: An algorithm is the thinking behind what needs to happen while the program
          is the actual instructions given to the computer to make it happen. An algorithm
          has to be translated into a program before a computer can run it. Breaking
          a task into steps called an algorithm is sometimes difficult. But like any
          new skill, it gets easier and easier with practice.

          internet breaks the message into smaller parts so it can be sent more easily.
          These small parts are called packets. Each packet of the message is delivered
          to the destination one at a time. These packets are all put together in
          the right order so that the receiver can read the message correctly. Of
          course, there are many more things to learn about how the internet works
          but this is a great start. You're on your way to becoming a savvy internet

          In my job, we think a lot about how contacts can be sent to other devices,
          such as your phone. Most people have a lot of contacts, you might have say,
          1000 contacts and we don't want to send all of those contacts at once to
          your phone because it's too large of a message. Similar to the way the internet
          breaks large messages down into packets, we use a concept called paging
          where we might only send your phone 100 contacts at a time and let your
          phone respond to us and ask for the next 100.

          that they can reliably execute those things and unbelievable speed. A computer

          For example, let's use the block that says if there's a path to the left,
          and put a turn left command inside it. We're telling the zombie to check
          its surroundings, see if there's a path on the left and if so, make that

          see that if we do that, if we take the turn to the left and otherwise moving

          now there's a new part at the bottom that says else. The if/else block lets
          the bee make a decision between two sets of actions. If the bee is at a
          flower, the bee will do the set of actions you put in the first part where
          it says do. If the bee is not at a flower, the bee will do the set of actions

          The top of our if/else block says if at flower. But the top of our block
          could say other things, like if nectar equals 2 or if there's a path ahead,
          our block will behave in the same way. That if the statement at the top
          is true it will do the first set of actions. But if the statement at the
          top is false, it will do the second set of actions.

          with sides of 100 pixels? We shouldn't have to make two separate functions

          In the function editor, you can edit the name and description like before
          but now you can also add a parameter. Write the name of your parameter in
          the space and click Add Parameter. This will create a red block with the
          name of the parameter you just created. Now we can replace the move forward

          next to length because the function wants to know what value the parameter
          Length should have. Drag a number block from the Math category and place
          it in this space. See how you can use the function again and again with
          different lengths to make squares of different sizes? Try it for yourself!

          height to fifty and then change my algorithm to tell the artist to go up
          by height, turn right and then go over by height times 2, which gives us

          those details. For instance, one monster in the catalog has vegitas eyes
          and another has spritem eyes. But they both have eyes so we can write a

          instead of a semi-colon. This gives us space to put other commands in the
          middle. Every command that we place inside these brackets will run when
          the player presses the up arrow.

          a stone in front of our character before we can move forward. That way we
          can safely move on. Time for more mining! And remember to use the if statement

          are just a few basics of programming and you can start playing a game that
          you created.

        text: Do you have a favorite video game? We're going to take one step toward
          creating games just like that in PlayLab. Good games have a story and every
          story has actors. Actors that do things like speak, move and interact with
          each other. Maybe even score points based on the rules of the game. Today,
          we'll be learning how to do all these things one by one with fun actors
          and then build a game from scratch that can be shared and played on a phone.

        text: To start off, you'll need to link your blocks to the orange when run
          block. You can link multiple blocks together by dragging them out until
          you see the yellow line and then they'll snap together.

        text: In this first puzzle, we'll make the actors say something by linking
          the "say" block to the when run block and typing in your message. Once you
          have your blocks in place, hit the run button to see what you programmed.

        text: Get started and by the end you'll be able to create your own game with
          all kinds of players that can interact, score points, throw things, and
          vanish each other. It's all up to you!

        text: Now we're going to learn about something all game programmers use everyday.
          They're called events. An event tells your program to listen for when something
          happens and then when it does, the game performs an action.
      2:
        image: notes/gumball_events_2.JPG
        text: Some examples of events are listening for a mouse click or an up or
          down arrow key or even a tap on the screen.

        image: notes/gumball_events_3.JPG
        text: Here, we're going to make the actor say something when the player clicks
          on it. We will use the when clicked block and attach the "say" block to
          it. When the player clicks, all the blocks attached to this block will be
          performed.
      4:
        image: notes/gumball_events_4.JPG
        text: There are also when arrow blocks. If you link move blocks to those,
          you can start to move your actors up, down, left, right, with the arrow
          keys. Little by little your game is getting more interactive.
    gumball_repeat:

        image: notes/gumball_repeat_1.JPG
        text: Can you imagine if you had to repeat something forever and ever? Hopefully
          you never have to because computers are really good at repeating things.
      2:
        image: notes/gumball_repeat_2.JPG
        text: This is the repeat forever block. Anything inside this block will happen
          forever in the game. If we want an actor to do something repeatedly without
          the player having to do anything, we'll put those blocks inside the repeat
          forever block.

        text: In this next puzzle, our goal is to help the actor do a job continuously.
          Learning how the repeat commands work will save you a ton of time later
          when you build your own game.
