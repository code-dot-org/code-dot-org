          title: Tečaj 1
          description: Golf 1 namijenjen je učenicima koji su tek naučili čitati da
            stvaraju računalne programe koji će im pomoći naučiti surađivati s drugima,
            razvijati sposobnost rješavanja problema i ustrajati kroz teške zadatke.
            Do kraja ovog tečaja, učenici će stvoriti vlastitu igru ili priču koju
            mogu podijeliti. Preporučuje se za uzrast do 1. razreda.

          description: |
            In this unit, students extend their understanding of the internet and how it functions by building off the concepts learned when sending bits in Unit 1. The unit largely explores the
            structure and design of the internet and the implications of those design decisions including
            the reliability of network communication, the security of data, and personal privacy. Topics
            include the Internet Protocol (IP), DNS, TCP/IP, cryptography and other security and hacking
            concerns.

            intuitions about what could be learned or extracted from it, and being
            able to use computational tools to manipulate data and communicate about
            it are the primary skills addressed in the unit.

            is encoded, represented and manipulated. Being able to digitally manipulate
            data, visualize it, and identify patterns, trends and possible meanings
            are important practical skills that computer scientists do every day.
            Understanding where data comes from, having intuitions about what could
            be learned or extracted from it, and being able to use computational tools
            to manipulate data and communicate about it are the primary skills addressed

          description: Course B is for early readers. Students will create computer
            programs that will help them learn to collaborate with others, develop
            problem-solving skills, and persist through difficult tasks. By the end
            of this course, students create their very own custom game or story that
            they can share. Recommended for 1st grade.
