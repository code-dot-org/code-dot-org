        you like, and then click finish to move on.
      Big Game Animation 2 (copy 1)_instruction: |
        The function 'update-target'
        function takes the target's current x value, and returns an updated value.
        Complete the 'update-target' function so that it adds to the x value each
        time it is called. The more you add to x, the faster the target will go.
      Big Game Animation 2_instruction: |
        The update-target function takes the target's
        current x value, and returns an updated value. Complete the update-target
        function so that it adds to the x value each time it is called. The more you
        add to x, the faster the target will go.
      Big Game Animation 3_instruction: |
        The update-danger function should work just
        like update-target, except that the danger should move from the right side
        over towards the left. Complete update-danger to make the danger fly across
        the screen.
      Big Game Animation 4_instruction: |
        At this point your game your danger should
        run across the screen from right to left, and your target should run across
        from left to right. They don't ever come back on screen once they've left,
        but we'll take care of that later. Take a minute to make sure your game is
        working like you want it to, and then click finish to move on.
      Big Game Booleans 1_instruction: |
        When you last worked on your game we got
        our target and danger sprites to fly across the screen, but they never come
        back. Click run to see how your game is currently working, and then click
        finish and we'll work on making those sprites reappear on screen after they've
        left.
      Big Game Booleans 2_instruction: |
        Go to the Functions section of the toolbox
        and complete the safe-left? function so that it returns true if the sprite's
        x coordinate is greater than -50. If you're successful you should see the
        Danger go off the left side and then return on right side.
      Big Game Booleans 3_instruction: |
        Now that you've got safe-left?, let's fill
        in safe-right? - it should take in a sprite's x coordinate and return true
        if that coordinate is less than 450. Once your safe-right? is complete you
        should see the Target go off the right side of the screen and return on the
        left.
      Big Game Booleans 4_instruction: |
        Complete the onscreen? function so that it
        checks whether both safe-left? and safe-right? are true.
      Big Game Booleans 5_instruction: |
        At this point your danger should run across
        the screen from right to left, your target should run across from left to
        right, and they should both return to the opposite side, repeatedly. Take
        a minute to make sure your game is working like you want it to, and then click
        Finish to move on.
      Big Game Collision 1 (copy 1)_instruction: |

        see how your game is currently working, and then we'll dig into the final
        missing piece - collision detection!
      Big Game Collision 2_instruction: |
        To move the player up and down, we'll need
        to use a conditional block to figure out which key is pressed and respond
        accordingly. Computers read keypresses as numeric key codes - the up arrow
        is 38 and the down arrow is 40. You can lookup other key codes in your student
        workbook. Edit the 'update-player' function so that if moves the player
        up when the up arrow is pressed, or down when the down arrow is pressed.
      Big Game Collision 3_instruction: |
        Use the Distance Formula, so the distance
        function returns the distance between the player's center coordinates (px,
        py) and another sprite's center coordinates (cx, cy).
      Big Game Collision 4_instruction: |

      Course 4 Artist Params 11_instruction: |
        How about a function called "pinwheel"
        that takes three parameters - "sides," "length" and "repeat." You can
        calculate how much to turn after each shape using the same math you used to
        figure out the turns for a shape of "sides". Can you recreate this picture?
        Here's a tip each shape is 100 pixel's in length.
      Course 4 Artist Params 12_instruction: |
        Use your "pinwheel" function to draw
        each of these shapes. The side length for each image is 50.

      Course 4 Artist Params 2_instruction: |
        That triangle function would be a whole
        lot more useful if it could draw triangles of different sizes. I've added
        a parameter for line length, but it doesn't do anything yet. Can you update
        the function so it uses the "length" parameter when it draws each side?
        The triangle sizes are 150 pixels, 75 pixels and 25 pixels.
      Course 4 Artist Params 3_instruction: "Awesome, can you draw each of these\ntriangles
        with that new function? The first is 25 pixels long, the second\nis 50, and
        the third is 75. \n"
      Course 4 Artist Params 4_instruction: |
        Can you add a new function called square?
        It should also take a length parameter, just like the triangle. This time
        draw 3 squares 25, 50 and 75 pixels in length,100 pixels apart.
      Course 4 Artist Params 5_instruction: |
        Use both of your new functions to draw
        this picture. To make this easier you use a loop with a "counter" parameter.
      Course 4 Artist Params 6_instruction: "Let's edit this \"draw a shape\" function.\nIt

      Course 4 Artist Params 9_instruction: |
        Do you remember when we used the counter
        loop but removed a loop within? Let's have some fun and use the "draw a
        shape" function with "sides" and "length" parameters. Can you re create
        these shapes? The square counter should be 5/100/5, the triangle counter should
        be 10/100/10 and the hexagon is 2/100/2.
      Course 4 Artist Var 9_instruction: |
        Here's the algorithm to draw a triangle,
        modify it so it uses the "sides" variable instead. Replace the number 3

        "sider" til å tegne hvert triangel. Se gjennom koden og hver gang du ser tallet
        3 erstatter du det med en "sider" variabel. Huske å bruke "set sider" blokken.
      Course 4 Artist Vars 11_instruction: Her er samme algoritmen som vi kom opp
        med for den forrige gåten –  hva bør du sette variabelen "sider" til for å
        tegne dette bildet av kvadrater?
      Course 4 Artist Vars 12_instruction: La oss sette variabelen "sider" til 5.
        Dess flere  sidene vi legge til denne algoritmen, dess større blir hele dette
        mønsteret! La oss legge til en ny variabel kalt "lengde" og bruke det hvor
        du har en "flytte fremover." Angi variabelen "lengde" til 75 for figuren.
      Course 4 Artist Vars 13_instruction: Jo flere sider en figur har, jo kortere
        må hver side være for at hele mønsteret skal passe på skjermen. I stedet for

      Course 4 Artist Vars 2_instruction: I stedet for "går fremover med 100," refererer
        "Flytt" blokken nå variabelen "lengde". Kan du sette "lengde" til 150 for
        å  tegne den nye trekanten?
      Course 4 Artist Vars 3_instruction: 'Her er en løkke som tegner et kvadrat,
        men noe mangler. Får du til å fikse det slik at den bruker variabelen lengde

      Course 4 Artist Vars 4_instruction: Nå ønsker jeg å lage et rektangel som er
        dobbelt så høyt som det er bredt. Vi har en variabel kalt "bredde" som er

        din. (360 delt "sider" på to steder nå) '
      Course 4 Artist Vars 9_instruction: Endre denne algoritmen bruker variabelen
        "sider" i stedet for et for å tegne en trekant. Erstatt nummer 3 med variabelen

        nectar.
      Course 4 Bee 7_instruction: |
        Use everything you have learned so far to collect
        all the nectar. The purple flower may have either 3, 2, or 1 nectar.
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 1_instruction: |
        Use a loop to collect the nectar from
        each flower.
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 10_instruction: |
        If your loop is counting down, the
        increment is subtracted from your counter variable each loop. What should
        your increment be to collect 9, then 6, and then 3 nectar?
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 11_instruction: |
        What's wrong with this loop? See if
        you can fix it and make the bee collect all the nectar.
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 2_instruction: |
        Here's a new kind of loop, called the
        "for" loop. This particular for loop will count from 1 to 5 by 1, and run
        the contents of the loop each time it counts. Help the Bee get the nectar.
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 3_instruction: |
        You can solve this puzzle by using a
        for loop to count from 1 to 3 by 1. Now let's go get some nectar!
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 4_instruction: |
        Collect all of the nectar from these
        flowers. I wonder if there's an easier way to do this...
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 5_instruction: "Ah, the for loop makes this much easier!\nUsing
        the \"counter\" variable from the for loop to loop the \"get nectar\"\nblock
        the same number of times as the loop. Whew! That's a lot of loops.\nAll the

        on Run and see how it works. \n"
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 6_instruction: |
        You can also use a for loop to count
        down. Try gathering this nectar by counting down from 5 to 1 by 1.
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 7_instruction: |
        Use your for loop "counter" variable
        to control how far to move horizontally.
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 8_instruction: |
        Can you use the loop variable to control
        movement and nectar collection?
      Course 4 Bee For Loops 9_instruction: |
        The last number in your for loop is
        called the "increment,"  and each time the loop is run the counter variable
        changes by the increment. Try collecting these flowers using an increment
        of 2.
      Course 4 Bee Params 1_instruction: |
        Use the function "get 3 nectar" which
        turns, moves to collect the nectar, and then returns to the original location.
        Write a sequence to collect all of the nectar using "get 3 nectar."
      Course 4 Bee Params 2_instruction: |
        Modify the "get 3 nectar" function so
        it makes me turn right instead of left to the flowers.
      Course 4 Bee Params 3 (copy 1)_instruction: |
        Now there are flowers on both
        sides! Maybe you can use a parameter so that the same function works for flowers
        on either side. I've added a parameter called "direction" to the function.
        If the "direction" parameter equals 0 I should turn left, if it's 1 I should
        turn right.
      Course 4 Bee Params 3_instruction: |
        Now there are flowers on both sides! I've
        added a parameter called "direction" to the function. Use the "left" and
        "right" variables to control direction. Fill in the rest of the function
        definition and then click "Save and Close."
      Course 4 Bee Params 4 (copy 1)_instruction: |
        Try using your new function to
        collect all of the flowers. Remember, 0 = left and 1 = right.
      Course 4 Bee Params 4 backup_instruction: |
        Wouldn't it be nice if we could
        collect all of these nectars with the a single function? Try adding a new
        parameter to your function called "nectars" to control the amount of nectar
        to collect. You'll probably want to rename the function too!
      Course 4 Bee Params 4_instruction: |
        Try using your new function to collect
        all of the flowers. Remember to use the left and right variables.
      Course 4 Bee Params 5_instruction: |

      Course 4 Bee Params 6_instruction: |
        Wouldn't it be nice if we could collect
        all of these nectars with the a single function? Try adding a new parameter
        to your function called "nectar units" to control the amount of nectar to
        collect. You'll probably want to rename the function too!
      Course 4 Bee Params 7 (copy 1)_instruction: |

        all of this nectar.
      Course 4 Bee Params 8_instruction: |
        Challenge: Now there's honey to deal with
        too! Rewrite your function to take in both the number of honey units and the
        number of nectar units.  How would you use those numbers to decide what you
        should do?
      Course 4 Binary 1_instruction: |
        Here's a function that takes a binary string
        of 1's and 0's and instructs the farmer to turn on the go from left to right,
        top to bottom, turning on the squares where the number has a zero. Run the
        code provided to see how the farmers uses binary to draw an image.
      Course 4 Binary 2_instruction: |
        What binary string could you loop 8 times to
        draw this image? Hint: the number "1" fills a hole.
      Course 4 Binary 3_instruction: |
        Can you draw this pattern by looping a single
        binary string?

        Cool, now we've got our score
        variable, but how are we going to make it useful? How about adding to your
        score variable each time you hit the enemy with a fireball? Use the "when
        actor 2 touches anything" event to trigger an update to your score when your
        fireballs hit the cat. You can increment the score by setting score = score
        + 1. Get your score up to 10 (going one at a time!) to pass the level.

        Let's make the dog speak every
        number from 1 to 100. Use a for loop and the counter block to speak the counter
        variable each time the loop is run.
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 2_instruction: |
        This time, let's try counting
        the odd numbers from 1 to 100.
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 3_instruction: |
        If we count by larger numbers,
        we count even higher in the same amount of time. Try making the dog count
        from 10 up to 1000, by 10 at a time.
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 4_instruction: |
        Changing the increment can be
        helpful, but we're still counting linearly (each number is the same distance
        from the last) What if I wanted to count exponentially? Without changing the
        settings in this for loop, can you count 1, 4, 9 , 16, 25... (counter squared)?

      Eval Booleans 5_instruction: |
        This OR block returns true if either of its parameters
        is true. Otherwise, if both parameters are false it will return false. Set
        the y variable to a value that will cause this expression to return false.
      Eval Booleans 6_instruction: |
        Here's one more boolean block called NOT. This
        block flips true to false, or false to true. If you wrap this block of code
        in a NOT block, it should return true (because we are asking if the two expressions
        do NOT produce equal values).

        so you don't keep drawing over the same diamond.
      Standalone_Artist_5_instruction: |
        How many times do you need to loop this diamond
        to draw the flower?
      Standalone_Artist_6_instruction: |
        Loop this hexagon code 6 times to create
        the design. How many degrees will you need to turn each time? Hint: divide
        the number of degrees in a circle by the number of times you are looping.
      Standalone_Artist_7_instruction: |
        A function is another programming tool to
        help you avoid repeating yourself. This function draws a flower, so you can
        use it any time you want to draw a flower. Use this and the new jump block
        to draw these flowers. Hint: The flowers are 150 pixels apart
      Standalone_Artist_8_instruction: |
        Here's a function called "Draw a shape"
        that we've programmed to draw hexagons. Run the code to see what it does
        and then experiment with the function to see what happens. Can you make it
        draw a pattern of squares, triangles, or octagons?
      Standalone_Artist_9_instruction: |
        Now go ahead and make whatever picture you'd
        like! You've even got an empty function that you can make do whatever you
        want!
      Standalone_Artist_v2_instruction: |
        Welcome to Artist! First off, let's try
        to make a simple square using the turn right block and move forward block.
        Each side should be 100 pixels long.
      Test Play Lab_instruction: This is a test play lab level.
      Text Compression Peter Piper_instruction: |
        This poem has been compressed by
        replacing two common phrases with symbols in the dictionary. Can you identify
        another common pattern to compress the poem further?

      U2L10 NetSim Automatic DNS_instruction: |
        In this version of the Internet Simulator,
        a Domain Name System (DNS) is provided for you and knows the IP addresses
        of all connected computers. Send a message in the form GET [hostname] to the
        DNS service at address <yourRouterNumber>.15 to get a student's address.
      U2L10 NetSim Manual DNS_instruction: |
        In this version of the simulator you
        can't see the other students' addresses.  Instead, one of you must act as
        a name service, to help share addresses with each other.
      U2L2 NetSim Hub Mode_instruction: "Now use the Internet Simulator to send the\nbattleship
        moves. For setup, join a Room with your group, and add ships to\nyour paper
        board for each opponent. When playing, all communication must be\ndone through
        the tool, so no talking, but have fun!\r\n"
      U2L3 NetSim Hub Mode_instruction: |
        Use the Internet Simulator to test out your
        group's binary communication protocol for battleship. How short can you make
        the message and response?
      U2L4 NetSim Routers Addresses_instruction: "For this activity, connect to a\nrouter
        with the others in your group. Important note: The router will only\nproperly
        route messages where the first 4 bits are the To: address and the\nsecond

      U2L7 NetSim Need for Packets_instruction: |
        Transfer your favicon to a partner
        across a network in which the larger a packet grows, the more likely it is
        to be dropped.
      U313 Two Buttons with Ids_instruction: |
        Now you try it! We've given you some
        starting code with two buttons and two event handlers on the screen, but we've
        just left the default Ids of "id".  You need to change the ids to connect
        the right event handler to the right button. (Interestingly, the incorrect
        program does work, but exhibits some bizarre behavior.  We'll discuss this
        more in the next lesson.  Make the buttons work correctly for now).
      U3L03 choose your own drawing_instruction: |
        Now choose your own!  Pick one
        of the three drawings shown here and attempt to create it on your own, making
        smart decisions about how to break the problem down into re-usable functions.  You
        will review your work with a peer using "procedures peer review rubric."  Check
        it for the requirements.  GIF: U3L3-ProceduresChooseOne.png
      U3L03 Creating Procedures 1_instruction: |
        Write the turnAround() function and
        use it to make the turtle move as depicted. see: U3L03-turnAndDown.gif
      U3L03 Define and use turnAround_instruction: |
        Write the turnAround() function
        and use it to make the turtle move as depicted.
      U3L03 define turnRight and draw a rectangle_instruction: "Create a turnRight()\nfunction
        and draw a rectangle twice as tall as it is wide by having the turtle\nnavigate
        clockwise to draw the rectangle. \n"
      U3L03 Draw a T using turnAround_instruction: |
        The turnAround function is now
        provided for you in the code.  Use the turnAround() function to draw a T as
        depicted.
      U3L03 draw diamond_instruction: "Use any and all of the functions you wrote\npreviously
        to make a 'diamond' shape as shown in the image.\r\n\r\nNOTE:\nthis is another
        tricky one.  The 4 sides of the diamond are made by drawing\nthree steps with
        other movement made between calls.  HINT: you might want\nto make another
        function that handles drawing one side of the diamond. "
      U3L03 Three Steps_instruction: |
        Draw 3 "steps" moving up and to the right.  Notice
        the pattern in the movement. You should define a function called drawStep()
        which draws one of the steps, and then call it 3 times to achieve the effect.
      U3L04 choose your own drawing_instruction: |
        Now choose your own!  Pick one
        of the three drawings shown here and attempt to create it on your own, making
        smart decisions about how to break the problem down into re-usable functions.  You
        will review your work with a peer using "procedures peer review rubric."  Check
        it for the requirements.
      U3L04 diamond solution_instruction: |
        Study this solution to the drawDiamond
        problem.  Notice that the whole program starts by calling drawDiamond() at
        the top.  The program then follows a chain of function calls.  You can trace
        what's happening in the code to see the functions reused.  It's also easy
        to read because the function names describe the expected behavior.
      U3L05_3x3GridEfficiencyChallenge_instruction: |
        Let's revisit the 3x3 grid
        problem you did a few lessons ago.  This time the challenge is to program
        the solution "as efficiently as possible."  Now that you know how to write
        functions, it should be easier to break the problem down, and your code should
        be easier to read and debug.  See the rubric for more details about requirements
        and expectations.
      U3L05_draw3x3GridEfficiently_instruction: |
        Draw a 3x3 grid above and to the
        right of the turtle. Try to do so with the fewest number of commands possible.
        NOTE: This is a very challenging problem.  You may need to play with it for
        a while and tweak it.  You might also consider using pencil and paper to sketch
        your ideas.
      U3L06 Challenge 1 triangle_instruction: |
        Check out the extended Turtle palette
        now made available to you. These new commands accept parameters, allowing
        you to specify precisely how the function operates rather than only being
        able to move or turn a predetermined amount. Make use of these functions to
        draw the triangle as shown.
      U3L06 Challenge 2 purple square_instruction: |
        This time we're going to learn
        a little bit about changing the turtle's pen. Read through the documentation
        for penWidth() and penColor(), and then draw the purple square as shown.
      U3L06 Challenge 3 fill pink_instruction: |
        Now let's try to fill in the entire
        background of the screen. To make it a little easier for you, we can tell
        you the color we chose is one of the 140 named colors.  If you don't know
        what the named colors are, take a closer look at the documentation for penColor()
        again. Hint: you need to use dot().
      U3L06 Challenge 4 bullseye_instruction: |
        Let's try this out one more time.
        This time the colors are NOT named colors - you need to use the hex-color
        number to set the color.  So that you're not randomly guessing, we'll give
        you a hint -- each of the colors shown in the target image is one of these
        one of the five in the following list:  #00ABDC, #CC4400, #1188CC, #006699,
        #11CC00  You might be able to guess correctly if you apply what you know about
        RGB colors.
      U3L06 Challenge 5 overlapping circles_instruction: |
        This image is created just
        using dot() and penColor() but, how are we going to get those circles to be
        transparent?  If you haven't gotten the hint yet: check out the documentation!
      U3L06 Challenge 6 squiggles_instruction: |
        Next we're going to be adding some
        curves to our drawing. Read the documentation for the "arc" commands and
        then draw the squiggles as shown. To make things easier here's a hint: all
        the parameters are multiples of 10, and the colors are from the following
        list of named colors: PowderBlue, lightBlue, Indigo, Purple, Magenta.
      U3L06 Challenge 7 smiley face_instruction: |
        To make this smiley face you'll
        need to look at the documentation for the move() command and then use it with
        the others you've learned.  You can make reasonable guesses about the colors.
      U3L06 Challenge 8 make your own_instruction: |
        Use the tools you've learned
        today to create a drawing of your own creation. If you have time, challenge
        your friends to see if they can duplicate your image.  We'll show you the
        drawing we made for ourselves.  You can try to duplicate that if you want
        to, otherwise, have fun making your own!
      U3L07 - Free Play Loops and Random_instruction: |
        Free Play!  Use what you learned
        from loops and random to make your own little scene.  Have fun.
      U3L07 - Starry Night Starter Code_instruction: "You are going to use loops\nand
        random numbers to generate an image of starry night sky similar to one\nshown
        here.  We have given you some starter code to generate the ground and\nsky
        (just two giant dots), you will add code to this project to make the stars,\ngrass,
        and moon.  All of the effects are clever applications of turtle dots,\nlines,
        and colors.  To get started, follow the series of steps suggested in\nthe
        accompanying worksheet. \n"
      U3L08 - Enchantment Under the Sea_instruction: |
        You have been provided with
        starter code for an “Under the Sea” scene which includes three functions,
        one each for the starfish, sea grass, and fish. Create versions of these functions
        which accept parameters to allow you to add more variation to your scene.  The
        student worksheet provides more details and guidance.
      U3L13 - Button with ID_instruction: |
        Drag a button out onto the screen and
        set its text to "Go forth!".  Run the program to make sure you can see the
        button.
      U3L13 - Debug Id plus logic problem_instruction: "The last problem was an example\nof
        syntax error.  App Lab did not understand which object it should be listening\nto
        for a \"click\" event so it showed an error message in the console to let\nyou
        know.  Another kind of error is a logical error - the program is valid,\nbut
        it's not doing what you want it to do.\r\n\r\nThis program has 2 errors.\nA
        (tricky) syntax error and logical error.  Find them, fix them, and make\nthe
        program work as expected."
      U3L13 - Debug Id Problem_instruction: |
        This program has problem!  Can you figure
        it out?  Run the program and see if you can figure out from the error messages
        in the console what the issue is.  There is not much code, so you might be
        able to figure it out just by reading carefully.  Make a change that will
        make the program work as expected.
      U3L13 - Turtle Driver Project_instruction: |
        Challenge: Create a “turtle driver”
        with at least three buttons on the screen to move the turtle forward, and
        turn the turtle right and left. You can copy/paste code from a previous level
        if you like but it will help build your coding muscles if you create this
        small program from scratch.  If you have time, try adding additional buttons!  You
        can also have fun changing the parameters on the turtle functions, using colors,
        etc.
      U3L13 - Turtle move with button_instruction: "Drag a button out onto the screen\nand
        set its text to \"Go forth!\".  Add an event handler for the button, that\nmakes
        the turtle move forward.  Run the program to make sure it works. \n"

      U3L16 - hideAndShow_instruction: |
        Introducing textInput, getText and write.  First
        run the starter code several times.  Try to change what's written to the
        screen when the button is clicked. Then use getText to write to the screen
        what the user entered in the text box. GIF: U3L16 - useGetText.gif
      U3L16 - hideAndShowPractice_instruction: |
        You are given some starting code
        that puts an image and two buttons on the screen.  The image is initially
        hidden. Add two new event handlers: one for each button, that when clicked
        hide and show the image.
      U3L16 - image and text labels_instruction: |
        Introducing the setPosition command!  Replace
        the moveTo in the button-click event handler to use setPosition to move the
        button itself to a random location when it's clicked.
      U3L16 - images and text labels_instruction: "Introducing objects other than\nbuttons!
        - textLabels and images.  First try replacing your button with a\ntextLabel.

      U3L16 - quick double click_instruction: |
        Mini-Project.  The Quick Double-Click
        game.  In this simple game an object (an image) moves around, or pops up randomly
        on the screen, as the user clicks it.  The goal of our game will be to try
        to double-click the object before it moves.  Part of the challenge (and fun)
        here is creating this app from scratch.  You can look back at your previous
        work for examples, but it's fun to create something from scratch, too.  Try
        it!  For more details see the Activity guide for this lesson.
      U3L16 - setPosition to move button_instruction: |
        Introducing the setPosition
        command!  Replace the moveTo in the button-click event handler to use setPosition

      U3L19 - Clicker Game Freeplay Area_instruction: |
        Use this App Lab area to improve
        your clicker game.  You should start by copy/pasting the code from your old
        game here.  We're showing a more full set of blocks in the toolbox - some
        of the things you might not have used yet.  Feel free to explore then and
        experiment if you want to.  Everything else you need should be shown.  Have
        fun!
      U3L19 - Debugging with consoleLog_instruction: |
        This example shows how you
        might insert console.log statements in your code to verify for yourself how
        the values in the variables change during the running of the code.  This is
        an important debugging technique to use when each line in your program doesn't
        have a visual effect on the app that you can see to verify things are working
        right.  Run the code to see the output in the console.
      U3L19 - DEMO up down count practice app_instruction: |
        This is a demonstration
        of a simple App that uses variables, arithmetic and setText.  Play with it
        a little bit here to see what it does.  You can also come back to experiment
        if you want.  You are going to try to create this app yourself on the next
        screen.  Don't worry, we'll start you out with some of the code and leave
        the rest for you to complete.
      U3L19 - do concatenate string with var_instruction: "We've given you a piece\nof
        code from the previous screen.  Try changing the value assigned to foo\nto
        see the string change. \r\nDo this: \r\n1. Try changing the value assigned\nto
        foo to see the string change. \r\n2. By only modifying the lines of code\nthat

        come up at some point later in your life.\r\n\r\n"
      U3L19 - practice with setText_instruction: |
        We've started you out with the
        code shown on the previous screen.  First experiment with the app.  Identify
        where setText is being used.  CHALLENGE: modify the code to also use setText
        to change the text on the button itself when it's clicked.  GIF: U3L19 -
        setTextOfButton.gif
      U3L19 - Target Clicker App_instruction: "# A motivating example\r\n\r\nHere\nis
        an example of the kind of app we want to make.  Study this for the elements\ncontained

        seem like you need to learn a lot in order to get this simple thing\nworking.
        \ But it's worth taking the time to understand at a deeper level\nwhat is
        going on.  Because this one topic: controlling memory leads to many\npossible
        misunderstandings about coding, and how computers work.  We want\nto make
        sure you get it right from the outset.  \r\n\r\nSo take your time.  Work\nthrough
        the issues.  Read the explanations.  You'll come out on the other\nside a
        better programmer with much deeper knowledge and understanding of how\nthings
        work.  \r\n\r\nAre you ready?  Click 'finish' to move to the next\npage and
        start the lesson."
      U3L19 - test reassignment of two vars_instruction: |
        Why is this happening?
        The code given here is the same as the example from the previous page where
        we asked you to make a prediction about what will happen.  Run this code to
        find out if you were right.  If you weren't, that's okay.  You might experiment  a
        little if you want to, but bon't spend too much time here. We'll explain
        more on the next page.
      U3L19 - three basic ops of variables_instruction: "Do this:\r\nWe've given\nyou
        the three lines of code shown in the previous page.  Add three lines of\ncode
        just below the ones shown here to make your own variable, assign it a\nvalue
        and write it to the screen.  NOTE: change the variable name from the\ndefault
        x to something else.\r\n"
      U3L19 - try out console log_instruction: "Try out console.log.  Do this: replace\nthe
        statement write(\"foo is: \" + foo) with console.log(\"foo is: \" + foo).
        \ Run\nthe program and you should see the output show up in the console area
        below\nthe workspace.  Then try adding a few more console.log statements.
        \ Display\nsome text.  Make another variable and display that.  \r\nThe app
        screen will\nbe blank -- that's the point.  With console.log you can test
        output behind\nthe scenes in a way the user cannot see.  \r\n\r\n\r\nGIF:

      U3L19 - up down count practice app_instruction: |
        This app is only SLIGHTLY
        different from the previous one, but much more dynamic.  See if you can figure
        out how and why the count is going up.  Once you've figured it out then you
        should be able to DO THIS: add a button to the app that when clicked makes
        the count go down, and updates the label.  When you're done the app should
        work as shown in the demonstration.  GIF: U3L19 - upDownCountApp.gif
      U3L19 - updating variables pt1_instruction: |
        This app is only SLIGHTLY different
        from the previous one, but much more dynamic.  See if you can figure out how

      U3L19 - variable reassignment challenge pt2_instruction: |
        We've given you
        the code from the previous page.  Right now, because the code only sets the
        values of variables, the app doesn't display anything. DO THIS: insert write
        or console.log statements into the code to figure out what the values of a,
        b, and c are after the code has executed.  You should have first made a prediction
        to see if your mental model of how the computer works is correct.  We'll
        ask for the answer on the next page.
      U3L19 - variable scope problem 2_instruction: |
        First run the program to see
        the problem.  You don't need to write code to solve any problem here.  But
        you do need to investigate the code and come up with an explanation for WHY
        what's happening is happening.  Why aren't 3 things being written to the
        screen?  Why does the variable foo seem to exist once but not the other times?  If
        you switch to code mode you'll see some warning messages next to two lines
        of code -- why do you get those messages?  Once you think you have a good
        answer, continue to the next page.
      U3L19 - variable scoping problem debugging_instruction: "Here is the code from\nprevious
        page that has a subtle problem with it.  FIRST: run the app and try\nit to
        see the problem. NOTE: NaN stands for \"Not a Number\".   DO THIS: figure\nout
        what's happening, where, and fix the problem.  We'll explain the issue\non
        the next page. \n"
      U3L19 - write var and string with same name_instruction: |
        Now look at this
        example. We’ve added another write statement.  Before you run the code, see
        if you can predict what the output will be.  Seriously, write it down. THEN
        run the code, mess with it if you like, and continue to the next page for
        an explanation.
