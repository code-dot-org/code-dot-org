                and size properties and math to detect whether two sprites are touching.  The
                class then uses the isTouching() block to create different effects
                when sprites collide, including playing sounds.  Last, they use their
                new skills to improve the sidescroller game that they started in the

              description_student: 'The class learns to combine the velocity properties
                of sprites with the counter pattern to create more complex sprite
                movement, such as simulating gravity, making a sprite jump, and allowing
                a sprite to float left or right. In the final levels the class combine
                these movements to animate and control a single sprite and build a
                simple game in which a character flies around and collects coins. '

                make a sprite jump, and allow a sprite to float left or right. In
                the final levels of the Code Studio progression students combine these
                movements to animate and control a single sprite and build a simple
                game in which a character flies around and collects a coin. Students

                new ways.  After a brief review of how they used the isTouching block,
                the class brainstorms other ways that two sprites could interact.  They
                then use isTouching to make one sprite push another across the screen
                before practicing with the four collision blocks (collide, displace,
                bounce, and bounceOff).
              description_teacher: Students program their sprites to interact in new
                ways.  After a brief review of how they used the `isTouching` block,

                their code, make it more readable, and remove repeated blocks of code.
                The class learns that higher level or more abstract steps make it
                easier to understand and reason about steps, then begins to create
                functions in Game Lab.  At the end of the lesson the class uses these
                skills to organize and add functionality to the final version of their
                side scroller game.
              description_teacher: Students learn how to create functions to organize
                their code, make it more readable, and remove repeated blocks of code.
                An unplugged warmup explores how directions at different levels of
                detail can be useful depending on context. Students learn that higher
                level or more abstract steps make it easier to understand and reason
                about steps. Afterwards students learn to create functions in Game
                Lab. They will use functions to remove long blocks of code from their
                draw loop and to replace repeated pieces of code with a single function.
                At the end of the lesson students use these skills to organize and
                add functionality to the final version of their side scroller game.
            The Game Design Process:
              name: The Game Design Process
              description_student: This lesson introduces the process the class will
                use to design games for the remainder of the unit. The class walks
                through through this process in a series of levels. As part of this
                lesson the class also briefly learn to use multi-frame animations
                in Game Lab. At the end of the lesson they have an opportunity to
                make improvements to the game to make it their own.
              description_teacher: This lesson introduces students to the process
                they will use to design games for the remainder of the unit. This
                process is centered around a project guide which asks students to
                define their sprites, variables, and functions before they begin programming
                their game. In this lesson students begin by playing a game on Game
                Lab where the code is hidden. They discuss what they think the sprites,
                variables, and functions would need to be to make the game. They are
                then given a completed project guide which shows one way to implement
                the game. Students are then walked through this process through a
                series of levels. As part of this lesson students also briefly learn
                to use multi-frame animations in Game Lab. At the end of the lesson
                students have an opportunity to make improvements to the game to make
                it their own.
            Using the Game Design Process:
              name: Using the Game Design Process
              description_student: In this multi-day lesson, the class uses the problem
                solving process from Unit 1 to create a platform jumper game.  After
                looking at a sample game, the class defines what their games will
                look like and uses a structured process to build them.  Finally, the
                class reflects on how the games could be improved, and implements
                those changes.
              description_teacher: In this multi-day lesson, students use the problem
                solving process from Unit 1 to create a platform jumper game.  They
                start by looking at an example of a platform jumper, then define what
                their games will look like.  Next, they use a structured process to
                plan the backgrounds, variables, sprites, and functions they will
                need to implement their game.  After writing the code for the game,
                students will reflect on how the game could be improved, and implement
                those changes.

              name: Programming for Entertainment
              description_student: The class is asked to consider the "problems" of
                boredom and self expression, and to reflect on how they approach those
                problems in their own lives. From there, they will explore how Computer
                Science in general, and programming specifically, plays a role in
                either a specific form of entertainment or as a vehicle for self expression.

            Plotting Shapes:
              name: Plotting Shapes
              description_student: Students explore the challenges of communicating
                how to draw with shapes and use a tool that introduces how this problem
                is approached in Game Lab. The warm up activity quickly demonstrates
                the challenges of communicating position without some shared reference
                point. In the main activity students explore a Game Lab tool that
                allows students to interactively place shapes on Game Lab's 400 by
                400 grid. They then take turns instructing a partner how to draw a
                hidden image using this tool, accounting for many challenges students
                will encounter when programming in Game Lab. Students optionally create
                their own image to communicate before a debrief discussion.

            Shapes and Randomness:
              name: Shapes and Randomness
              description_student: This lesson extends the drawing skills to include
                width and height and introduces the concept of random number generation.
                The class learns to draw with versions of ellipse() and rect() that
                include width and height parameters and to use the background() block
                to fill the screen with color. At the end of the progression the class
                is introduced to the randomNumber() block and uses the new blocks
                to draw a randomized rainbow snake.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students continue to develop their
                drawing skills. At the beginning of the lesson a teacher-led discussion
                connects expanded block functionality (e.g. different sized shapes)
                with the need for more block inputs, or "parameters". Students learn
                to draw with versions of `ellipse()` and `rect()` that include width
                and height parameters. They also learn to use the `background()` block.
                At the end of the progression students are introduced to the `randomNumber()`
                block. Combining all of these skills students will draw a randomized
                rainbow snake at the end of the lesson.
            Variables:
              name: Variables
              description_student: This lesson introduces variables as a way to label
                a number in a program or save a randomly generated value. The class
                begins the lesson with a very basic description of the purpose of
                a variable and practices using the new blocks.  Afterwards, the class
                uses variables to save a random number, allowing the programs to use
                the same random number multiple times.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students learn how to use variables
                to label a number in their program or save a randomly generated value.
                Students begin the lesson with a very basic description of the purpose
                of a variable. Students then complete a level progression that reinforces
                the model of a variable as a way to label or name a number. Students
                use variables to save a random number to see that variables actually
                store or save their values, allowing them to use the same random number
                multiple times in their programs.
            Sprites:
              name: Sprites
              description_student: In order to create more interesting and detailed
                images, the class is introduced to the sprite object. Every sprite
                can be assigned an image to show, and sprites also keep track of multiple
                values about themselves, which will prove useful down the road when
                making animations.  At the end of the lesson, everyone creates a scene
                using sprites.

            The Draw Loop:
              name: The Draw Loop
              description_student: This lesson introduces the draw loop, one of the
                core programming paradigms in Game Lab.  The class combines the draw
                loop with random numbers to manipulate some simple animations with
                dots and then with sprites. Afterwards, everyone uses what they learned
                to update the sprite scene from the previous lesson.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students are introduced to the draw
                loop, one of the core programming paradigms in Game Lab. To begin
                the lesson students look at some physical flipbooks to see that having
                many frames with different images creates the impression of motion.
                Students then watch a video explaining how the draw loop in Game Lab
                helps to create this same impression in their programs. Students combine
                the draw loop with random numbers to manipulate some simple animations
                with dots and then with sprites. At the end of the lesson students
                use what they learned to update their sprite scene from the previous
                lesson.
            The Counter Pattern Unplugged:
              name: The Counter Pattern Unplugged
              description_student: This unplugged lesson explores the underlying behavior
                of variables. Using notecards and string to simulate variables within
                a program, the class implements a few short programs. Once comfortable
                with this syntax, the class uses the same process with sprite properties,
                tracking a sprite's progress across the screen.
              description_teacher: Students explore the underlying behavior of variables
                through an unplugged activity. Using notecards and string to simulate
                variables within a program, students implement a few short programs.

            Sprite Movement:
              name: Sprite Movement
              description_student: By combining the Draw Loop and the Counter Pattern,
                the class writes programs that move sprites across the screen, as
                well as animate other sprite properties.

                as animate other sprite properties.
            Conditionals:
              name: Conditionals
              description_student: The class starts by using booleans to compare the
                current value of a sprite property with a target value, using that
                comparison to determine when a sprite has reached a point on the screen,
                grown to a given size, or otherwise reached a value using the counter
                pattern. After using booleans directly to investigate the values or
                sprite properties, the class adds conditional if statements to write
                code that responds to those boolean comparisons.

                code that responds to those boolean comparisons.
            Keyboard Input:
              name: Keyboard Input
              description_student: Following the introduction to booleans and if statements
                in the previous lesson, students are introduced to a new block called
                keyDown() which returns a boolean and can be used in conditionals
                statements to move sprites around the screen. By the end of this lesson
                students will have written programs that take keyboard input from
                the user to control sprites on the screen.
              description_teacher: Following the introduction to booleans and _if_
                statements in the previous lesson, students are introduced to a new
                block called `keyDown()` which returns a boolean and can be used in
                conditionals statements to move sprites around the screen. By the
                end of this lesson students will have written programs that take keyboard
                input from the user to control sprites on the screen.
            Other Forms of Input:
              name: Other Forms of Input
              description_student: The class continues to explore ways to use conditional
                statements to take user input. In addition to the simple keyDown()
                command learned yesterday, the class learns about several other keyboard
                input commands as well as ways to take mouse input.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students continue to explore ways
                to use conditional statements to take user input. In addition to the

                about several other keyboard input commands as well as ways to take
                mouse input.
            Booleans Unplugged:
              name: Booleans Unplugged
              description_student: This lesson introduces boolean values and logic,
                as well as conditional statements. The class starts by playing a simple
                game of Stand Up, Sit Down in which the boolean (true/false) statements
                describe personal properties (hair or eye color, clothing type, age,
                etc). The class then groups objects based on increasingly complex
                boolean statements, then looks at how conditionals can impact the
                flow of a program.
              description_teacher: |-
                In this lesson, students are introduced to boolean values and logic, as well as conditional statements. The class starts by playing a simple game of Stand Up, Sit Down in which the boolean (true/false) statements describe personal properties (hair or eye color, clothing type, age, etc). This gets students thinking about how they can frame a property with multiple potential values (such as age) with a binary question.

                From there students are provided a group of objects with similar, yet varying, physical properties. With a partner they group those objects based on increasingly complex boolean statements, including compound booleans with AND and OR.

                Finally we reveal Conditionals as a tool to make decisions or impact the flow of a program using boolean statements as input.
            Project - Interactive Card:
              name: Project - Interactive Card
              description_student: In this cumulative project for Chapter 1, the class
                plans for and develops an interactive greeting card using all of the
                programming techniques they've learned to this point.

            Project - Design a Game:
              name: Project - Design a Game
              description_student: The class plans and builds original games using
                the project guide from the previous two lessons. Working individually
                or in pairs, the class plans, develops, and gives feedback on the
                games.  After incorporating the peer feedback, the class shares out
                the completed games.
              description_teacher: Students will plan and build their own game using
                the project guide from the previous two lessons to guide their project.
                Working individually or in pairs, students will first decide on the
                type of game they'd like to build, taking as inspiration a set of
                sample games. They will then complete a blank project guide where
                they will describe the game's behavior and scope out the variables,
                sprites, and functions they'll need to build. In Code Studio, a series
                of levels prompts them on a general sequence they can use to implement
                this plan. Partway through the process, students will share their
                projects for peer review and will incorporate feedback as they finish
                their game. At the end of the lesson, students will share their completed
                games with their classmates. This project will span multiple classes
                and can easily take anywhere from 3-5 class periods.

                for a computer, the class works in groups to sort pictures into “is
                a computer” or “is not a computer” on poster paper and explain their
                motivations for choosing some of the most difficult categorizations.  The
                teacher then introduces a definition of the computer and allows groups
                to revise their posters according to the new definition.

                use. Groups are assigned to a computing device and based on a teacher-provided

                device. Earlier in the activity students are prompted to focus on
                more obvious physical inputs and outputs (e.g. a keyboard as an input
                or a screen as an output) but later discussions lead students to consider
                less obvious examples (e.g. that a touch screen is both an input and
                output, or the fact that the Internet can serve as both input and
                output). Throughout the lesson the teacher records inputs and outputs
                that are identified on a T-Chart at the front of the room. To conclude
                the lesson students examine common activities they do on a computing
                device and select the inputs and outputs used for that activity from
                the chart.
            Processing:
              name: Processing
              description_student: This lesson dives deeper into the concept of processing
                that was introduced as part of the definition of a computer.  Pairs
                work together to puta deck of cards in order, a form of processing
                information.  In the end, the class discusses what processing means
                within the context of solving information problems.
              description_teacher: Students complete two unplugged card sorting activities
                to explore the meaning of processing and its relationship to problem-solving.
                The first has few constraints and is used to introduce a high-level
                definition of processing. The next introduces more constraints that
                forces students to develop an algorithm that will always successfully
                process the cards. Students iteratively develop, test, and share their
                algorithms with classmates. A wrap-up discussion has students reflect
                on the different types of problem-solving they used in these activities
                and the value of producing an algorithm to solve a problem.
            Storage:
              name: Storage
              description_student: This lesson focuses on the storage component of
                the definition of a computer, within the content of processing information.
                The class spends the majority of the lesson developing and sharing
                algorithms to process information, with an emphasis on how much storage
                is needed for any particular algorithm. The lesson concludes with
                a discussion of the importance of storage while processing information.
              description_teacher: Students explore the importance of storage within
                the Input-Storage-Processing-Output model of a computer. The warm-up
                activity asks students to reflect on the types of information they
                have seen computers store in the past, like documents, photographs,
                or videos. The unplugged main activity has students develop an algorithm
                to process a small pile of cards in search of specific cards within
                the deck. Constraints on how students can move the cards force them
                to consider the importance of storage even while they are processing
                the deck. The lesson concludes with a discussion of the two types
                of storage students saw in this lesson and the importance of storage
                while processing information.

                Students begin by individually identifying appropriate audiences with whom they would be comfortable sharing given pieces of personal information.  They then look at several social media pages to determine what sorts of information people are sharing about themselves or one another.  Last, students reflect on what guidelines they think are appropriate for posting information online.\r
                \r
                The ultimate point of this lesson is not to scare students, but rather to experientially bring students to realizing precisely what level of control they don’t have in releasing information into the web.

                about how web searches work and how to find relevant and trustworthy
                information online. After viewing and discussion a video about how
                search engines work, students will search for information about several
                unlikely animals. They'll need to analyze the sites they find for
                reliability in order to identify which of the animals is actually
                a hoax.

              description_teacher: 'Before starting to design apps, we need to help
                students to better scope their expectations. Because students will
                eventually be prototyping these apps in App Lab, they will be in better
                shape if their ideas align with the kinds of apps that are easily
                prototyped in App Lab. Teams start this scoping by looking through
                several example apps designed to demonstrate apps that can be created

          description: Unit 6 explores the role of hardware platforms in computing
            and how different sensors can provide more effective input and output
            than the traditional keyboard, mouse, and monitor. Using App Lab and Adafruit’s
            Circuit Playground, you’ll develop programs that utilize the same hardware
            inputs and outputs that you see in the smart devices, looking at how a
            simple rough prototype can lead to a finished product. The unit concludes
            with a design challenge to use the Circuit Playground as the basis for
            an innovation of your own design.

                platforms while expanding your understanding of what a computer can
                be.
              description_teacher: To kick off the final unit of this course, students
                will do some research into interesting innovations in computing. This
                lesson will expose students to wider variety of computing form factors
                (what a computer looks like) and fields that are impacted by computing.
                Later in this unit students will look back on the devices they encountered
                in this lesson as they develop their own physical computing devices.
            Input Unplugged:
              name: Input Unplugged
              description_student: Explore some of the different ways that an app
                can take input from a user, and learn more about the event-driven
                programming model used in App Lab.
              description_teacher: In preparation for delving deeper into programming
                with App Lab, students will explore how a handful of different programs
                written in both Game Lab and App Lab handle taking input from the
                user. After comparing and contrasting the approaches they saw in the
                example apps, students group up to act out the two different models
                for input (conditionals in an infinite and asynchronous events) to
                gain a better understanding of how they work.
            Event Types:
              name: Event Types
              description_student: Review the basics of programming in App Lab and
                explore some new event types that can be used in your programs.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students review the material they
                learned about creating apps in App Lab from Unit 4 in order to prepare
                for a return to App Lab in this unit. This review should be modified
                to best meet the needs of your students and their experience and familiarity
                with programming in App Lab. In addition to the review the students
                will also experiment with a variety of new event types that they likely
                have not seen before.
            Getters and Setters:
              name: Getters and Setters
              description_student: To expand the kinds of interactions that students
                can use in App Lab we introduce the concept of "getters" and "setters",
                commands which can get and set (or change) the content and properties
                of various design elements.

            The Circuit Playground:
              name: The Circuit Playground
              description_student: Students are introduced to the Circuit Playground,
                a microcomputer that will be the platform used throughout the rest
                of this unit.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students get their first opportunity
                to write programs that use the Circuit Playground for output. After
                first inspecting the board visually and hypothesizing possibly functionalities,
                students move online where they will learn to write applications that
                blink an LED and make noise with a buzzer.
            Lists:
              name: Lists
              description_student: Students learn to use lists to store a series of
                related values in a single variable.
              description_teacher: Students learn to use lists to store a series of
                related values in a single variable. From there, students will explore
                ways to extract either a specific or random value from a list using
                its index.
            Lights:
              name: Lights
              description_student: 'Now that students have learned how lists can be
                used to deal with groups of related values, we''ll return to the board
                and look at the color LEDs, which are accessed through the list `colorLeds`. '

              description_student: Students are introduced to the for loop in this
                lesson as a way to repeat some code a certain numbers of times. They
                spend time practicing in an unplugged context with simple robot commands
                and then take their knowledge into App Lab.

            Lists and For Loops:
              name: Lists and For Loops
              description_student: 'In this lesson students combine what they have
                learned about lists and for loops. Students use for loops to go through
                each element in a list one at a time without having to write code
                for each element. Towards the end of the lesson students will apply

              description_student: In this lesson we build on students understanding
                of for loops to learn about a more sophisticated structure called
                a timed loop. Unlike for loops, you can control how quickly a timed
                loop repeats, and other code (such as event handlers) can be run between
                iterations of the loop. This allows us to create interesting animations
                that repeat infinitely, while still allowing other code to run alongside
                it.
              description_teacher: In this lesson we build on students understanding

              name: Physical Input
              description_student: Using the hardware buttons and switch, students
                learn to use onBoardEvent(), analogously to onEvent(), in order to
                take input from their Circuit Playgrounds.
              description_teacher: Using the hardware buttons and switch, students
                learn to use `onBoardEvent()`, analogously to `onEvent()`, in order
                to take input from their Circuit Playgrounds.
            Analog Input:
              name: Analog Input
              description_student: Students explore the three analog sensors on the
                Circuit Playground which measure sound, light, and temperature.

              description_student: Following up on the sensor investigations from
                the previous day, students will work to develop three simple applications
                - one for each of the analog sensors.

            Designing Screens with Code:
              name: Designing Screens with Code
              description_student: By reading and changing the content on the screen
                of an app, the class starts to build apps that only need a single
                screen. Even with just one screen, these techniques allow for lots
                of user interaction and functionality.
              description_teacher: In Unit 4 students learned a very simple approach
                to app development in App Lab that required a separate screen for
                most interactions. To expand the kinds of apps that students can make,
                and to encourage them to think in new ways about how users interact
                with apps, we introduce the `setProperty()` block. This command can
                be used to set the content and properties of various UI elements,
                allowing students to write programs that update information on a single
                screen, instead of manually creating duplicate screens. In this lesson
                students build up simple apps that only require a single screen, the
                content of which is changed using `setProperty()`.
            Board Events:
              name: Board Events
              description_student: Using the hardware buttons and switch, the class
                develops programs that use the Circuit Playground as an input.
              description_teacher: This lesson transitions students from consider
                the Circuit Playground as strictly an output device towards using
                it as a tool for both input and output. Starting with the hardware
                buttons and switch,sing the hardware buttons and switch, students
                learn to use `onBoardEvent()`, analogously to `onEvent()`, in order
                to take input from their Circuit Playgrounds.
            Getting Properties:
              name: Getting Properties
              description_student: This lesson introduces students to the getProperty
                block, which allows them to access the properties of different elements
                with code.  Students first practice using the block to determine what
                the user has input in various user interface elements. Students later
                use getProperty and setProperty together with the counter patters
                to make elements move across the screen.  A new screen element, the
                slider, and a new event trigger, onChange, are also introduced.
              description_teacher: This lesson introduces students to the `getProperty`
                block, which allows them to access the properties of different elements

            The Program Design Process:
              name: The Program Design Process
              description_student: This lesson introduces students to the process
                they will use to design programs of their own throughout this unit.
                This process is centered around a project guide which asks students
                to sketch out their screens, identify elements of the Circuit Playground
                to be used, define variables, and describe events before they begin
                programming. This process is similar to the Game Design Process that
                we used in Unit 3. In this lesson students begin by playing a tug
                o' war style game where the code is hidden. They discuss what they
                think the board components, events, and variables would need to be
                to make the program. They are then given a completed project guide
                which shows one way to implement the project. Students are then walked
                through this process through a series of levels. At the end of the
                lesson students have an opportunity to make improvements to the program
                to make it their own.

              name: Arrays
              description_student: Learn how lists can be used to store multiple values
                in a single variable name.
              description_teacher: An array is an ordered collection of items, usually
                of the same type. In this lesson, students learn ways to access either
                a specific or random value from a list using its index.  They then
                learn how to access the colorLEDs array that controls the behavior
                of the color LEDs on the Circuit Playground.  Students will control
                the color and intensity of each LED, then use what they have learned
                to program light patterns to create a light show on their Circuit
                Playground.
            Making Music:
              name: Making Music
              description_student: In this lesson students will use the buzzer to
                its full extent by producing sounds, notes, and songs with the buzzer.
                Students start with a short review of the buzzer's frequency and duration
                parameters, then move on to the concept of notes.  Notes allow students
                to constrain themselves to frequencies that are used in Western music
                and provide a layer of abstraction that helps them to understand which
                frequencies might sound good together.  Onces students are able to
                play notes on the buzzer, they use arrays to hold and play sequences
                of notes, forming simple songs.

            Arrays and For Loops:
              name: Arrays and For Loops
              description_student: Combining _lists_ and _for loops_ allows you to
                write code that impacts every element of a list, regardless of how
                long it is. The class uses this structure to write programs that process
                all of the elements in lists, include the list of color LEDs.
              description_teacher: Using a _for loop_ to iterate over all of the elements
                in an array is a really useful construct in most programming languages.
                In this lesson, students learn the basics of how a _for loop_ can
                be used to repeat code, and then combine it with what they've already
                learned about arrays to write programs that process all elements in
                an array. Students use for loops to go through each element in a list
                one at a time without having to write code for each element. Towards
                the end of the lesson students will apply this with the `colorLed`
                list on the board to create an app that changes all of the LEDs each
                time a button is clicked.
            Accelerometer:
              name: Accelerometer
              description_student: In this lesson, students will explore the accelerometer
                and its capabilities. They’ll become familiar with its events and
                properties, as well as create multiple programs utilizing the accelerometer
                similar to those they’ve likely come across in real world applications.

              description_student: The lesson starts with a quick review of parameters,
                in the context of App Lab blocks that they students have seen recently.  Students
                then look at examples of parameters within user-created functions
                in App Lab and create and call functions with parameters for themselves,
                using them to control multiple elements on a screen.  Afterwards,
                students use for loops to iterate over an array, passing each element
                into a function.  Last, students use what they have learned to create
                a star catching game.

                using them to control multiple elements on a screen.  Afterwards,
                students use for loops to iterate over an array, passing each element
                into a function.  Last, students use what they have learned to create
                a star catching game.

                students will learn how to develop a prototype of a physical object
                that includes a Circuit Playground. Using a modelled project planning
                guide, students will learn how to wire a couple of simple circuits
                and to build prototypes that can communicate the intended design of
                a product, using cheap and easily found materials such as cardboard
                and duct tape.

          description_short: Learn how people use computers to solve data problems.
          description: Unit 5 is about the importance of data in solving problems
            and highlights how computers can help in this process. The first chapter
            explores different systems used to represent information in a computer
            and the challenges and tradeoffs posed by using them. In the second chapter
            you’ll learn how collections of data are used to solve problems, and how
            computers help to automate the steps of this process. The chapter concludes
            by considering how the data problem solving process can be applied to
            an area of the your choosing.

              description_student: In the first lesson of the data unit, students
                will get an overview of what data is and how it is used to solve problems.  Students
                will start off with a brief discussion to come to a common understanding
                of data.  They then split into groups and use a data set to make a
                series of meal recommendations for people with various criteria.  Each
                group has the choices of meal represented in a different way (pictures,
                recipes, menu, nutrition) that gives an advantage for one of the recommendations.  Afterwards,
                groups compare their responses and discuss how the different representations
                of the meal data affected how the students were able to solve the
                different problems.

            Patterns and Representation:
              name: Patterns and Representation
              description_student: In this lesson students create their own system
                for representing information. They begin by brainstorming all the
                different systems they already use to represent yes-no responses.
                They then work in small groups to create a system that can represent
                any letter in the alphabet using only a single stack of cards. The
                cards used have one of 6 different possible drawings (6 animals, 6
                colors, etc.) and so to represent the entire alphabet students will
                need to use patterns of multiple cards to represent each letter. Students
                will create messages with their systems and exchange with other groups
                to ensure the system worked as intended. In the wrap-up discussion
                the class will review any pros and cons of the different systems.
                They will discuss commonalities between working systems and recognize
                that there are many possible solutions to this problem and what's
                important is that everyone use the same arbitrary system to communicate.

            ASCII and Binary Representation:
              name: ASCII and Binary Representation
              description_student: In this lesson students learn to use their first
                binary system for encoding information, the ASCII system for representing
                letters and other characters. At the beginning of the lesson the teacher
                introduces the fact that computers must represent information using
                either "on" or "off". Then students are introduced to the ASCII system
                for representing text using binary symbols. Students practice using
                this system before encoding their own message using ASCII. At the
                end of the lesson a debrief conversation helps synthesize the key
                learning objectives of the activity.

            Representing Images:
              name: Representing Images
              description_student: In this lesson students learn how computers represent
                images. To begin the lesson they consider the challenge of turning
                all the complexity of vision into a binary pattern. Through a series
                of images showing how this transformation is made students are introduced
                to the concept of splitting images into squares or "pixels" which
                can then be turned on or off individually to make the entire image.
                Students then do a short set of challenges using the Pixelation Widget
                in order to draw black and white images. Puzzles are designed to call
                out some of the challenges of representing images in this way. In
                the wrap up students make connections between the system for representing
                images and the system for representing text they learned in the previous
                lesson.

              description_student: In this lesson, students use all three types of
                binary representation systems (ASCII characters, binary number, and
                images) to decode information in a record.  After seeing a series
                of bits and being asked to decode them, students are introduced to
                the idea that in order to understand binary information, they must
                understand both the system that is being used and the meaning of the
                information encoded.  They then decode a record representing a pet
                based on a given structure.

              description_student: In this lesson students design a structure to represent
                their perfect day using the binary representation systems they've
                learned in this chapter. Students will first write a short description
                of their perfect day and then review with a partner to identify the
                key pieces of information they think a computer could capture. As
                a class students will decide how a punch card of bytes of information
                will be interpreted to represent those pieces of information. Students
                will then use the ASCII, binary number, and image formats they have
                learned to represent their perfect days. Students then trade punch
                cards and try to decipher what the other student's perfect day is
                like. The lesson ends with a reflection.

                with data based on some problems designed to be familiar to middle
                school students. Students work in groups discussing how they would
                use the data presented to make a decision before the class discusses
                their final choices. Not all questions have right answers and in some
                cases students can and should decide that they should collect more
                data. The lesson concludes with a discussion of how different people
                could draw different conclusions from the same data, or how collecting
                different data might have affected the decisions they made.

              description_student: In this lesson, students go further into the interpretation
                of data, including cleaning and visualizing raw data sets.  Students
                first look at the how presenting data in different ways can help people
                to understand it better.  They then visualize their own raw data set,
                in the context of a pizza topping survey, deciding what to do with
                data that does not easily fit into the visualization scheme that they
                have chosen.  Last, students look at what parts of this process can
                be automated, and what need a human to make decisions.

            Automating Data Decisions:
              name: Automating Data Decisions
              description_student: In this lesson students look at a simple example
                of how a computer could be used to complete essentially every step
                of the data problem solving process. To begin students are given the
                clean data they collected about their ice cream preferences. They
                use a spreadsheet to visualize this data using simple charts and discuss
                in groups the decision they would make with this data. Students then
                create rules, or an algorithm, that a computer could use to make this
                decision automatically. Groups share their rules and what choices
                their rules would make with the class data. They then use their rules
                on data from another class to reinforce the fact that the rules they
                create should be useful for any data set. The lesson concludes with
                a discussion about the benefits and drawbacks of using computers to
                automate the data problem solving process.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students look at a simple example
                of how a computer could be used to complete essentially every step
                of the data problem solving process. To begin students are given the
                clean data they collected about their ice cream preferences. They
                use a spreadsheet to visualize this data using simple charts and discuss
                in groups the decision they would make with this data. Students then
                create rules, or an algorithm, that a computer could use to make this
                decision automatically. Groups share their rules and what choices
                their rules would make with the class data. They then use their rules
                on data from another class to reinforce the fact that the rules they
                create should be useful for any data set. The lesson concludes with
                a discussion about the benefits and drawbacks of using computers to
                automate the data problem solving process.
            Problem Solving with Big Data:
              name: Problem Solving with Big Data
              description_student: In this lesson, students look at how data is collected
                and used by a organizations to solve problems in the real world. The
                lesson begins with a quick review of the data problem solving process
                they have explored in this unit. Then students are presented three
                scenarios that could be solved using data and they brainstorm the
                types of data they would want to solve them and how they could collect
                the data. Each problem is designed to reflect a real-world service
                that exists. After brainstorming students will watch a video about
                a real-world service and will record notes about what data is collected
                by the real-world service and how it is used. At the end of the lesson
                students record whether data was provided actively by a user, was
                recorded passively, or is collected by sensors.

            Project - Solve a Data Problem:
              name: Project - Solve a Data Problem
              description_student: To conclude this unit students will design a way
                to use data to make a recommendation or prediction to help solve a
                problem. Students will follow a project guide to complete this multi-day
                activity. In the first several steps students brainstorm problems,
                perform simple research, and define a problem of their choosing. They
                will then decide what kind of data they would want to collect, how
                it could be collected, and how it could be used. Students will perform
                a peer review and make any necessary updates to their project before
                preparing a presentation to their classmates.

            Representing Numbers:
              name: Representing Numbers
              description_student: In this lesson, students learn about the binary
                number system.  With a set of cards that represent the place values
                in a binary (base-2) number system by a collection of dots, students
                turn bits "on" or "off" by turning cards face up and face down, then
                observe the numbers that result from these different patterns.  Eventually,
                student extend the pattern to a generic 4-bit system.

            8-bit Numbers:
              name: 8-bit Numbers
              description_student: Students review the concept of binary numbers,
                and discuss that they need to know the bit-length of each number in
                order to decode a series of bits.  They then made a flippy-do, a paper
                manipulative that will help them to encode and decode 8-bit numbers
                (0-255).  After practicing with the flippy-do, students discuss how
                they could extend that standardization to the other types of data.

            Encryption:
              name: Encryption
              description_student: Students have a discussion on the different levels
                of security they would like for personal data.  Once the class has
                developed an understanding of the importance of privacy, they learn
                about the process of encrypting information by enciphering a note
                for a partner and deciphering the partner's note.  The class concludes
                with a discussion about the importance of both physical and digital
                security.

            Structuring Data:
              name: Structuring Data
              description_student: This lesson goes further into the interpretation
                of data, including cleaning and visualizing raw data sets.  The class
                first looks at the how presenting data in different ways can help
                people to understand it better.  After seeing how cleaning and visualization
                can help people make better decisions, the class looks at what parts
                of this process can be automated, and what need a human.

                their own raw data set, in the context of a pizza topping survey,
                deciding what to do with data that does not easily fit into the visualization
                scheme that they have chosen.  Last, students look at what parts of
                this process can be automated, and what need a human to make decisions.

              description_teacher: This activity will begin with a short review of
                "Graph Paper Programming," then will quickly move to a race against
                the clock, as students break into teams and work together to write
                a program one instruction at a time.

            While Loops in Farmer:
              name: While Loops in Farmer
              description_student: 'Loops are so useful in coding. This lesson will
                teach you about a new kind of loop: while loops!'
              description_teacher: "By the time students reach this lesson, they should
                already have plenty of practice using `repeat` loops, so now it's
                time to mix things up. \n\n_While loops_ are loops that continue to
                repeat commands while a condition is met. While loops are used when
                the programmer doesn't know the exact number of times commands need
                to be repeated, but does know what condition needs to be true in order
                for the loop to continue repeating. For example, students will be
                working to fill holes and dig dirt in Farmer. They will not know the
                size of the holes or the height of the mountains of dirt, but the
                students will know they need to keep filling the holes and digging
                the dirt as long as the ground is not flat."

                only under certain conditions!
              description_teacher: 'This lesson demonstrates how conditionals can
                be used to tailor a program to specific information. We don’t always
                have all of the information we need when writing a program. Sometimes
                you will want to do something different in one situation than in another,
                even if you don''t know what situation will be true when your code
                runs. That is where conditionals come in. Conditionals allow a computer
                to make a decision, based on the information that is true any time
                your code is run.

                to program Bee to use them when collecting honey and nectar. '
              description_teacher: Up until this point students have been writing
                code that executes exactly the same way each time it is run - reliable,
                but not very flexible. In this lesson, your class will begin to code
                with conditionals, allowing them to write code that functions differently
                depending on the specific conditions the program encounters.

                and loops together!
              description_teacher: 'In this lesson, students will be pairing together
                two key concepts: loops and conditionals. This set of puzzles bridges
                the gaps in understanding that occur when working on puzzles that
                use multiple kinds of blocks. By bringing two ideas together, students
                will create more complex code that shows both impressive creativity
                and critical thinking!'
            Conditionals & Loops in Farmer:
              name: Conditionals & Loops in Farmer
              description_student: It's not always clear when to use each conditional.  This
                lesson will help you get practice deciding what to do.
              description_teacher: Students will practice `while` loops, `until` loops,
                and `if / else` statements. All of these blocks use conditionals.
                By practicing all three, students will learn to write complex and
                flexible code.

                lesson will help you learn the difference between safe and private
                information.
              description_teacher: |-
                In collaboration with Common Sense Education, this lesson helps students learn to think critically about the user information that some websites request or require. Students learn the difference between private information and personal information, distinguishing what is safe and unsafe to share online.

                Students will also explore what it means to be responsible and respectful to their offline and online communities as a step toward learning how to be good digital citizens.

              description_student: 'Learn how computers store pictures using simple
                ideas like on and off. '
              description_teacher: Though many people think of binary as strictly
                zeros and ones, students will be introduced to the idea that information
                can be represented in a variety of binary options. This lesson takes
                that concept one step further as it illustrates how a computer can
                store even more complex information (such as images and colors) in
                binary, as well.
            Artist Binary:

              description_student: Direct your own artist to create a binary image
                using only commands to turn pixels on and off.
              description_teacher: Binary is extremely important in the world of computers.
                The majority of computers today store all sorts of information in
                binary form. This lesson helps demonstrate how it is possible to take
                something from real life and translate it into a series of ons and
                offs. Students will build binary images in Artist by translating 0s
                and 1s to offs and ons (or blacks and whites).
            Nested Loops Project in Artist:
              name: Nested Loops Project in Artist
              description_student: Here you will be using nested loops to make cool
                projects to show to your family and friends.
              description_teacher: Now that students know how to layer their loops,
                they can create so many beautiful things.  This lesson will take students
                through a series of exercises to help them create their own portfolio-ready
                images.
            Debugging in Collector:

              description_student: Have you ever run into problems while coding? In
                this lesson, you will learn about the secrets of debugging. Debugging
                is the process of finding and fixing problems in your code.
              description_teacher: In this online activity, students will practice
                debugging in the "collector" environment. Students will get to practice
                reading and editing code to fix puzzles with simple algorithms, loops
                and nested loops.

                This project will help individuals gain experience with coding and
                produce an exemplar to share with peers and loved ones. Intended to
                be a multi-lesson or multi-week experience, students will spend time
                exploring brainstorming, learning about the design process, building,
                and presenting their final work. \n\nIn the explore stage, students
                will be able to view pre-built examples of projects in both Artist
                and Play Lab for inspiration. Next, students will learn about the
                design process and how to implement it in their own projects. They
                will then be given the space to create their own project in either
                Artist or Play Lab (this is likely the longest stage of the project).

                be building up to programming a project of their own design using
                either Play Lab or Artist as their programming environment. In this
                portion of the project, students will learn about the design process
                and how to implement it in their own projects. The lesson guide for
                all four stages of the process can be found in the first stage of

              description_teacher: This lesson introduces students to `while` loops
                and `if / else` statements. _While loops_ are loops that continue
                to repeat commands as long as a condition is true. While loops are
                used when the programmer doesn't know the exact number of times the
                commands need to be repeated, but the programmer does know what condition
                needs to be true in order for the loop to continue looping. `If /
                Else` statements offer flexibility in programming by running entire
                sections of code only if something is true, otherwise it runs something
                else.

              description_student: Even rockstars need programming skills. This lesson
                will teach you about functions using lyrics from songs.
              description_teacher: One of the most magnificent structures in the computer
                science world is the function. Functions (sometimes called procedures)
                are mini programs that you can use over and over inside of your bigger
                program. This lesson will help students intuitively understand why
                combining chunks of code into functions can be such a helpful practice.
            Functions in Artist:
              name: Functions in Artist
              description_student: Make complex drawings more easily with functions!
              description_teacher: Students will be introduced to using functions
                on Code.org. Magnificent images will be created and modified with
                functions in Artist. For more complicated patterns, students will
                learn about nesting functions by calling one function from inside
                another.

              description_teacher: Students have practiced creating impressive designs
                in Artist and navigating mazes in Bee, but today they will use functions
                to harvest crops in Farmer. This lesson will push students to use
                functions in the new ways by combining them with `while` loops and
                `if / else` statements.

                lessons and gives students a chance to think critically about how
                they would solve each problem, but without telling them which concept
                to apply. Students will review basic algorithms, debugging, `repeat`
                loops, conditionals, `while` loops, and functions.
            Build a Play Lab Game:
              name: Build a Play Lab Game

                students can create their own games and have interactions between
                characters and user input. Students will work with events to create
                keyboard controls. This set of puzzles will also loosely guide students
                through game development, but with freedom to add their own ideas.

                internet? It's not magic! This lesson will teach you the basics of
                how the internet works.
              description_teacher: Even though many people use the internet daily,
                not very many know how it works. In this lesson, students will pretend
                to flow through the internet, all the while learning about connections,
                URLs, IP Addresses, and the DNS.
            Crowdsourcing:

                the process of building a project with a team.
              description_teacher: In computer science, we face some big, daunting
                problems. Challenges such as finding large prime numbers or sequencing
                DNA are almost impossible to do as an individual. Adding the power
                of others makes these tasks manageable. This lesson will show your
                students how helpful teamwork can be in the industry of computer science.

          description: Created with fourth grade students in mind, this course begins
            with a brief review of concepts previously taught in courses C and D.
            This introduction is intended to inspire beginners and remind the experts
            of the wonders of computer science. Students will practice coding with
            algorithms, loops, conditionals, and events before they are introduced
            to functions. At the end of the course, students will have the opportunity
            to create a capstone project that they can proudly share with peers and
            loved ones.

          stages:
            'Algorithms: Tangrams':
              name: 'Algorithms: Tangrams'
              description_student: Here you will learn about algorithms using puzzles
                called tangrams!
              description_teacher: This lesson shows us something important about
                algorithms. As long as you keep an algorithm simple, there are lots
                of ways to use it. However, if you want to make sure everyone produces
                the same outcome, then your algorithm needs more detail. Students
                will learn the difference between a detailed and general algorithm
                while playing with tangrams.
            Introduction:
              name: Introduction
              description_student: This lesson will give you a brief introduction
                to some of the amazing things you will learn in this course!
              description_teacher: 'In this lesson, students will be introduced to
                sequences, loops, and nested loops to prepare them for more complicated
                concepts in the later part of the course. This "ramp up" lesson equalizes
                the playing field between the experts and the beginners in your class. '
            The Power of Words:
              name: The Power of Words
              description_student: Bullying is never okay. This lesson will teach
                you about what is and isn't okay to say online.
              description_teacher: "Students consider that while they are enjoying
                their favorite websites they may encounter messages from other kids
                that can make them feel angry, hurt, sad, or fearful. They explore
                ways to handle cyberbullying and how to respond in the face of upsetting
                language online.\n\nStudents discuss all the ways they use technology
                for communication and explore the similarities and differences between
                in-person and online communication. Students then brainstorm ways
                to respond to cyberbullying. "
            Ice Age Play Lab:
              name: Ice Age Play Lab
              description_student: Think of your favorite video game. Ever wondered
                how it was made? In these puzzles you will develop a video game of
                your own with friends from Ice Age!
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students are guided through a story
                featuring characters from Ice Age. Students will work with events
                and loops to make characters move on the screen, and will get the
                chance to create their own game or story after the guided levels.
            Envelope Variables:
              name: Envelope Variables
              description_student: 'Envelopes and variables have something in common:
                both can hold valuable things. Here you will learn what variables
                are and the awesome things they can do.'
              description_teacher: Variables are used as placeholders for values such
                as numbers or words. Variables allow for a lot of freedom in programming.
                Instead of having to type out a phrase many times or remember an obscure
                number, computer scientists can use variables to reference them. This
                lesson helps to explain what variables are and how we can use them
                in many different ways. The idea of variables isn't an easy concept
                to grasp, so we recommend allowing plenty of time for discussion at
                the end of the lesson.
            Variables in Artist:
              name: Variables in Artist
              description_student: Don't forget to bring creativity to class! In these
                puzzles you will be making fantastic drawings using variables.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students will explore the creation
                of repetitive designs using variables in the Artist environment. Students
                will learn how variables can be used to make code easier to write
                and easier to read. After guided puzzles, students will end in a freeplay
                level to show what they have learned and create their own designs.
            Variables in Play Lab:
              name: Variables in Play Lab
              description_student: Soon you will learn about making characters interact
                in a game using variables!
              description_teacher: Students will get further practice with variables
                in this lesson by creating scenes in Play Lab. Students will work
                with user input to set the values of their variables, then get space
                to create their own mini-project with variables.
            For Loop Fun:
              name: For Loop Fun
              description_student: You're going to have loads of fun learning about
                `for` loops!
              description_teacher: 'We know that loops allow us to do things over
                and over again, but now we’re going to learn how to use loops that
                have extra structures built right in. These new structures will allow
                students to create code that is more powerful and dynamic. '
            For Loops in Bee:
              name: For Loops in Bee
              description_student: Buzz buzz. In these puzzles you will be guiding
                a bee to nectar and honey using `for` loops!
              description_teacher: Featuring Bee, this lesson focuses on for loops
                and using an incrementing variable to solve more complicated puzzles.
                Students will begin by reviewing loops from previous lessons, then
                walked through using for loops to more effectively solve complicated
                problems.
            For Loops in Artist:
              name: For Loops in Artist
              description_student: Get ready to make your next masterpiece. Here you
                will be using `for` loops to make some jaw-dropping pictures.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students continue to practice for
                loops, this time with Artist. Students will complete puzzles combining
                the ideas of variables, loops, and for loops to create complex designs.
                At the end, they will have a chance to create their own art in a freeplay
                level.
            Songwriting with Parameters:
              name: Songwriting with Parameters
              description_student: You just might release the next big hit single!
                In this lesson, you will be learning what parameters are and how they
                make some fantastic songs!
              description_teacher: One of the most magnificent structures in the computer
                science world is the function. Functions (sometimes called procedures)
                are mini programs that you can use over and over inside of your bigger
                program. This lesson will help students intuitively understand why
                combining chunks of code into functions is such a helpful practice,
                and how they can use those structures even when chunks of code are
                slightly different.
            Conditionals and Functions in Bee:
              name: Conditionals and Functions in Bee
              description_student: The bee needs your help again! Here you will be
                using functions to get nectar and make honey!
              description_teacher: 'This lesson teaches students how to create simple
                functions using our sophisticated “modal” function editor, preparing
                the way for them to incorporate parameters in future lessons. '
            Functions with Parameters in Artist:
              name: Functions with Parameters in Artist
              description_student: Get your programming fingers ready. In these puzzles
                you will make impressive drawings in Artist using functions with parameters.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students continue working with
                functions with and without parameters. Students will get the chance
                to create their own drawings with and without parameters, before modifying
                functions in a freeplay level.
            Functions with Parameters in Bee:
              name: Functions with Parameters in Bee
              description_student: You've had a little practice using functions with
                parameters. This lesson will continue your practice with Bee!
              description_teacher: This lesson features the bee environment, and continues
                along the concept of functions with parameters from the previous Artist
                stage. Students will practice writing and using functions to follow
                complex paths and collect patterns of nectar and honey.
            Explore Project Ideas:
              name: Explore Project Ideas
              description_student: Time to get some inspiration! These puzzles will
                show you a handful of pre-built games and illustrations to help develop
                your plan for your BIG project.
              description_teacher: "The next five lessons provide an opportunity for
                students to put their coding skills to use in a capstone project.
                This project will help individuals gain experience with coding and
                produce an exemplar to share with peers and loved ones. This is intended
                to be a multi-lesson or multi-week project where students spend time
                brainstorming, learning about the design process, building, and then
                presenting their final work. \n\nIn the explore stage, students will
                be able to view examples of projects in both Artist and Play Lab for
                inspiration. Next, students will learn about the design process and
                how to implement it in their own projects. They will then be given
                the space to create their own project in either Artist or Play Lab
                (this is most likely the longest stage of the project). Students will
                then revise their projects, after testing and extra thought. Finally,
                students will be able to present their finished work to their peers."
            The Design Process:
              name: The Design Process
              description_student: Projects this big take time and plenty planning.
                Here, you will learn about the design process that you'll use to build
                your own creation.
              description_teacher: Over the course of five lessons, students will
                be building up to building a project of their own design using either
                Play Lab or Artist as their programming environment. In this portion
                of the project, students will learn about the design process and how
                to implement it in their own projects. The lesson guide overviewing
                all five stages of the process can be found in the beginning of the

          description_short: Learn how people use computers to solve data problems.
          description: Unit 5 is about the importance of data in solving problems
            and highlights how computers can help in this process. The first chapter
            explores different systems used to represent information in a computer
            and the challenges and tradeoffs posed by using them. In the second chapter
            you’ll learn how collections of data are used to solve problems, and how
            computers help to automate the steps of this process. The chapter concludes
            by considering how the data problem solving process can be applied to
            an area of the your choosing.

                allows students to interactively place shapes on Game Lab's 400 by
                400 grid. They then take turns instructing a partner how to draw a

                will encounter when programming in Game Lab. Students optionally create

                on the screen. Thee lesson covers the basics of sequencing and debugging,
                as well as a few simple commands. At the end of the lesson, the class

                a number in a program or save a randomly generated value. The class
                begins the lesson with a very basic description of the purpose of
                a variable and practices using the new blocks.  Afterwards, the class
                uses variables to save a random number, allowing the programs to use
                the same random number multiple times.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students learn how to use variables
                to label a number in their program or save a randomly generated value.
                Students begin the lesson with a very basic description of the purpose
                of a variable. Students then complete a level progression that reinforces
                the model of a variable as a way to label or name a number. Students
                use variables to save a random number to see that variables actually
                store or save their values, allowing them to use the same random number
                multiple times in their programs.

              description_student: In order to create more interesting and detailed
                images, the class is introduced to the sprite object. Every sprite
                can be assigned an image to show, and sprites also keep track of multiple
                values about themselves, which will prove useful down the road when
                making animations.  At the end of the lesson, everyone creates a scene
                using sprites.

            The Draw Loop:
              name: The Draw Loop
              description_student: This lesson introduces the draw loop, one of the
                core programming paradigms in Game Lab.  The class combines the draw
                loop with random numbers to manipulate some simple animations with
                dots and then with sprites. Afterwards, everyone uses what they learned
                to update the sprite scene from the previous lesson.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students are introduced to the draw
                loop, one of the core programming paradigms in Game Lab. To begin
                the lesson students look at some physical flipbooks to see that having
                many frames with different images creates the impression of motion.
                Students then watch a video explaining how the draw loop in Game Lab
                helps to create this same impression in their programs. Students combine
                the draw loop with random numbers to manipulate some simple animations
                with dots and then with sprites. At the end of the lesson students
                use what they learned to update their sprite scene from the previous
                lesson.
            The Counter Pattern Unplugged:

              description_student: This unplugged lesson explores the underlying behavior
                of variables. Using notecards and string to simulate variables within
                a program, the class implements a few short programs. Once comfortable
                with this syntax, the class uses the same process with sprite properties,
                tracking a sprite's progress across the screen.

                as animate other sprite properties.
            Booleans Unplugged:
              name: Booleans Unplugged
              description_student: This lesson introduces boolean values and logic,
                as well as conditional statements. The class starts by playing a simple
                game of Stand Up, Sit Down in which the boolean (true/false) statements
                describe personal properties (hair or eye color, clothing type, age,
                etc). The class then groups objects based on increasingly complex
                boolean statements, then looks at how conditionals can impact the
                flow of a program.
              description_teacher: |-
                In this lesson, students are introduced to boolean values and logic, as well as conditional statements. The class starts by playing a simple game of Stand Up, Sit Down in which the boolean (true/false) statements describe personal properties (hair or eye color, clothing type, age, etc). This gets students thinking about how they can frame a property with multiple potential values (such as age) with a binary question.

                From there students are provided a group of objects with similar, yet varying, physical properties. With a partner they group those objects based on increasingly complex boolean statements, including compound booleans with AND and OR.

                Finally we reveal Conditionals as a tool to make decisions or impact the flow of a program using boolean statements as input.
            Conditionals:
              name: Conditionals
              description_student: The class starts by using booleans to compare the
                current value of a sprite property with a target value, using that
                comparison to determine when a sprite has reached a point on the screen,
                grown to a given size, or otherwise reached a value using the counter
                pattern. After using booleans directly to investigate the values or
                sprite properties, the class adds conditional if statements to write
                code that responds to those boolean comparisons.

                sprite properties, students add conditional _if_ statements to write
                code that responds to those boolean comparisons.
            Keyboard Input:
              name: Keyboard Input
              description_student: Following the introduction to booleans and if statements
                in the previous lesson, students are introduced to a new block called
                keyDown() which returns a boolean and can be used in conditionals
                statements to move sprites around the screen. By the end of this lesson
                students will have written programs that take keyboard input from
                the user to control sprites on the screen.
              description_teacher: Following the introduction to booleans and _if_
                statements in the previous lesson, students are introduced to a new
                block called `keyDown()` which returns a boolean and can be used in
                conditionals statements to move sprites around the screen. By the
                end of this lesson students will have written programs that take keyboard
                input from the user to control sprites on the screen.
            Other Forms of Input:
              name: Other Forms of Input
              description_student: The class continues to explore ways to use conditional
                statements to take user input. In addition to the simple keyDown()
                command learned yesterday, the class learns about several other keyboard
                input commands as well as ways to take mouse input.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students continue to explore ways
                to use conditional statements to take user input. In addition to the
                simple `keyDown()` command learned yesterday, students will learn
                about several other keyboard input commands as well as ways to take
                mouse input.
            Project - Interactive Card:
              name: Project - Interactive Card
              description_student: In this cumulative project for Chapter 1, the class
                plans for and develops an interactive greeting card using all of the
                programming techniques they've learned to this point.

            Velocity:
              name: Velocity
              description_student: After a brief review of how the counter pattern
                is used to move sprites, the class is introduced to the properties
                that set velocity and rotation speed directly.   As they use these
                new properties in different ways, they build up the skills they need
                to create a basic side scroller game.
              description_teacher: After a brief review of how they used the counter
                pattern to move sprites in previous lessons, students are introduced
                to the properties that set velocity and rotation speed directly.   As
                they use these new properties in different ways, they build up the
                skills they need to create a basic side scroller game.
            Collision Detection:
              name: Collision Detection
              description_student: The class learns about collision detection on the
                computer.  Pairs explore how a computer could use sprite location
                and size properties and math to detect whether two sprites are touching.  The
                class then uses the isTouching() block to create different effects
                when sprites collide, including playing sounds.  Last, they use their
                new skills to improve the sidescroller game that they started in the
                last lesson.

            Complex Sprite Movement:
              name: Complex Sprite Movement
              description_student: 'The class learns to combine the velocity properties
                of sprites with the counter pattern to create more complex sprite
                movement, such as simulating gravity, making a sprite jump, and allowing
                a sprite to float left or right. In the final levels the class combine
                these movements to animate and control a single sprite and build a
                simple game in which a character flies around and collects coins. '
              description_teacher: Students learn to combine the velocity properties
                of sprites with the counter pattern to create more complex sprite
                movement. In particular students will learn how to simulate gravity,
                make a sprite jump, and allow a sprite to float left or right. In
                the final levels of the Code Studio progression students combine these
                movements to animate and control a single sprite and build a simple
                game in which a character flies around and collects a coin. Students
                are encouraged to make their own additions to the game in the final
                level.
            Collisions:
              name: Collisions
              description_student: The class programs their sprites to interact in
                new ways.  After a brief review of how they used the isTouching block,
                the class brainstorms other ways that two sprites could interact.  They
                then use isTouching to make one sprite push another across the screen
                before practicing with the four collision blocks (collide, displace,
                bounce, and bounceOff).
              description_teacher: Students program their sprites to interact in new
                ways.  After a brief review of how they used the `isTouching` block,
                students brainstorm other ways that two sprites could interact.  They
                then use `isTouching` to make one sprite push another across the screen
                before practicing with the four collision blocks (`collide`, `displace`,
                `bounce`, and `bounceOff`).
            Functions:
              name: Functions
              description_student: This lesson covers functions as a way to organize
                their code, make it more readable, and remove repeated blocks of code.
                The class learns that higher level or more abstract steps make it
                easier to understand and reason about steps, then begins to create
                functions in Game Lab.  At the end of the lesson the class uses these
                skills to organize and add functionality to the final version of their
                side scroller game.
              description_teacher: Students learn how to create functions to organize
                their code, make it more readable, and remove repeated blocks of code.
                An unplugged warmup explores how directions at different levels of
                detail can be useful depending on context. Students learn that higher
                level or more abstract steps make it easier to understand and reason
                about steps. Afterwards students learn to create functions in Game
                Lab. They will use functions to remove long blocks of code from their
                draw loop and to replace repeated pieces of code with a single function.
                At the end of the lesson students use these skills to organize and
                add functionality to the final version of their side scroller game.
            The Game Design Process:
              name: The Game Design Process
              description_student: This lesson introduces the process the class will
                use to design games for the remainder of the unit. The class walks
                through through this process in a series of levels. As part of this
                lesson the class also briefly learn to use multi-frame animations
                in Game Lab. At the end of the lesson they have an opportunity to
                make improvements to the game to make it their own.
              description_teacher: This lesson introduces students to the process
                they will use to design games for the remainder of the unit. This
                process is centered around a project guide which asks students to
                define their sprites, variables, and functions before they begin programming
                their game. In this lesson students begin by playing a game on Game
                Lab where the code is hidden. They discuss what they think the sprites,
                variables, and functions would need to be to make the game. They are
                then given a completed project guide which shows one way to implement
                the game. Students are then walked through this process through a
                series of levels. As part of this lesson students also briefly learn
                to use multi-frame animations in Game Lab. At the end of the lesson
                students have an opportunity to make improvements to the game to make
                it their own.
            Using the Game Design Process:
              name: Using the Game Design Process
              description_student: In this multi-day lesson, the class uses the problem
                solving process from Unit 1 to create a platform jumper game.  After
                looking at a sample game, the class defines what their games will
                look like and uses a structured process to build them.  Finally, the
                class reflects on how the games could be improved, and implements
                those changes.
              description_teacher: In this multi-day lesson, students use the problem
                solving process from Unit 1 to create a platform jumper game.  They
                start by looking at an example of a platform jumper, then define what
                their games will look like.  Next, they use a structured process to
                plan the backgrounds, variables, sprites, and functions they will
                need to implement their game.  After writing the code for the game,
                students will reflect on how the game could be improved, and implement
                those changes.
            Project - Design a Game:
              name: Project - Design a Game
              description_student: The class plans and builds original games using
                the project guide from the previous two lessons. Working individually
                or in pairs, the class plans, develops, and gives feedback on the
                games.  After incorporating the peer feedback, the class shares out
                the completed games.
              description_teacher: Students will plan and build their own game using
                the project guide from the previous two lessons to guide their project.
                Working individually or in pairs, students will first decide on the
                type of game they'd like to build, taking as inspiration a set of
                sample games. They will then complete a blank project guide where
                they will describe the game's behavior and scope out the variables,
                sprites, and functions they'll need to build. In Code Studio, a series
                of levels prompts them on a general sequence they can use to implement
                this plan. Partway through the process, students will share their
                projects for peer review and will incorporate feedback as they finish
                their game. At the end of the lesson, students will share their completed
                games with their classmates. This project will span multiple classes
                and can easily take anywhere from 3-5 class periods.

                might serve, both for the users and the creators. The class explores
                a handful of the most-used websites in the United States and discusses
                how each of those sites is useful for users and how it might also

                the problem of how to communicate both the content and structure of
                a website to a computer. The lesson begins with a brief unplugged
                activity demonstrating the challenges of effectively communicating
                the structure of a web page. The class looks at an HTML page in Web
                Lab and discusses how HTML tags help solve this problem, then uses
                HTML to write the first web pages of the unit.

                page in Web Lab and discuss with their classmates how HTML tags help
                solve this problem. Students then write their first HTML. A wrap-up
                discussion helps to solidify the understanding of content vs. structure
                that was developed throughout the lesson.

                to create page and section titles and learns how the different header
                elements are displayed by default.  Next, the class plans how to organize
                their content on the personal web pages that will be built across
                the unit and begins the first page of the project.

                structure text on web pages, this time with headings.  Students learn
                how the different heading elements are displayed by default and practice
                using them to create page and section titles.  Students then start
                to decide how they will organize their content on their own personal
                web pages.  In the last level, students begin the project that they

                to share digitally.  The class begins by discussing what types of
                information are good to share with other people, then looks at several
                sample social media pages to see what types of personal information
                could be shared intentionally or unintentionally.  Finally, the class
                comes up with a set of guidelines to follow when putting information
                online.
              description_teacher: |-
                As students have recently spent some time thinking about the actual content that will go into their personal website, this lesson takes a step back from the unit-long project (publication of a personal website) to help students articulate what personal information they choose to share digitally and with whom.  It also reinforces the notion that much of the information that they choose to share digitally falls largely out of their control the moment it is released.  \r

                Students begin by individually identifying appropriate audiences with whom they would be comfortable sharing given pieces of personal information.  They then look at several social media pages to determine what sorts of information people are sharing about themselves or one another.  Last, students reflect on what guidelines they think are appropriate for posting information online.\r
                \r
                The ultimate point of this lesson is not to scare students, but rather to experientially bring students to realizing precisely what level of control they don’t have in releasing information into the web.
            Lists:
              name: Lists
              description_student: This lesson introduces ordered and unordered lists
                and the associated  &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, and &lt;li&gt; HTML tags.  The
                class practices using the tags, then goes back to the personal web
                page project to add a new HTML page that includes the new tags.
              description_teacher: Students are introduced to ordered and unordered
                lists in HTML and work through a few levels in which they use the
                &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, and &lt;li&gt; tags.  They then go back to
                their project, where they add a new HTML page.  Inside the new page,
                they write the HTML to display a recipe, top ten list, or any other
                content that uses the new tags that they have learned.
            Intellectual Property and Images:

                video, or music created by others a website while respecting the rights
                of the creator of that media. After first studying Creative Commons
                licensing, the class learns how to add images to web pages, and how
                to give proper attribution when doing so.
              description_teacher: |-
                Starting with an discussion of their personal opinions on how others should be allowed to use their work, the class explores the purpose and role of copyright for both creators and users of creative content.  They then move on to an activity exploring the various Creative Commons licenses as a solution to the difficulty in dealing with copyright. \r
                \r
                Finally, with a common understanding of the restrictions of various Creative Commons licenses, students learn how to add images to their web pages using the &lt;img&gt; tag.

                an opportunity to flex their analytical skills in a search for strange
                and unlikely animals.
              description_teacher: This lesson encourages students to think more critically
                about how web searches work and how to find relevant and trustworthy
                information online. After viewing and discussion a video about how
                search engines work, students will search for information about several
                unlikely animals. They'll need to analyze the sites they find for
                reliability in order to identify which of the animals is actually
                a hoax.
            RGB Colors and Classes:

                class first learns how to specify custom colors using RGB (red, green,
                blue) values, then applies these colors to a new Four Seasons web
                page, which uses CSS classes.  Using classes, the class adds more
                styles to the Four Seasons web page, then use them to style their
                personal websites.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students first learn how to specify

                apply these colors to a new Four Seasons web page, which uses CSS
                classes.  CSS classes allow web developers to treat groups of elements
                they want styled differently than other elements of the same type.
                Using classes, students add more styles to the Four Seasons web page,
                then use them to style their personal websites.
