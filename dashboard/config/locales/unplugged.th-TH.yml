          the vocabulary words that are associated with the lessons that follow, but
          presenting them in a fun and playful light now is far more productive than
          waiting for more advanced opportunities."

          understand what programming is really about. The class will begin by students
          instructing each other to color squares in on graph paper in an effort to
          reproduce an existing picture.  If there's time, the lesson can conclude
          with images that the students create themselves.

          the first exercise will show how important it is to make each instruction
          as clear and unambiguous as possible.  Afterward, the class will explore
          how many ways you can fold paper into a rectangle, noting how some methods
          can take more or fewer folds than others.

        title: "ฟังก์ชัน"
        desc: In this lesson, students will make a suncatcher out of string, beads,
          and a special charm. The students will follow a series of repetitive steps,
          then be asked to identify certain sets of "skills" that are duplicated several
          times. Once those skills are defined, they will be called from a main program
          and the whole beautiful process of creation will be recorded on a single
          sheet of paper. The final program will be geared toward the entire class,
          whatever their type of string, beads, and charms. To effectively allow for
          this, students will need to "abstract out" the details of their specific
          materials and create vague terms for an individual's supplies.  This use
          of generic placeholders is a wonderful introduction to variables.

          education on defining and calling functions. Once students are familiar
          with the define/call process, we will add the extra capabilities that come
          along with passing parameters within those function calls.

          functions is such a helpful practice.  '
      BinaryImages:
        title: Binary Images
        desc: Though many people think of binary as strictly zeros and ones, our previous
          courses taught students that information can be represented in a variety
          of binary options.  This lesson takes that concept one step further as it
          illustrates how a computer can store even more complex information (such
          as images and colors) in binary, as well.
