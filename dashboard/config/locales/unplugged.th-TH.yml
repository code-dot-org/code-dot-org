        desc: บทนี้จะแนะนำหลักการของวิทยาการคอมพิวเตอร์ และ อธิบายสิ่งที่ นักวิทยาศาสตร์คอมพิวเตอร์ทำ.  เป็นโอกาสที่นักเรียนจะได้เห็นว่า
          ตัวเขาเหมาะจะเป็น นักวิทยาศาสตร์คอมพิวเตอร์แขนงใด.  By the end of the activity,
          each student will have a take-home reminder of what he or she learned.  You
          may be tempted to skip teaching young children the vocabulary words that
          are associated with the lessons that follow, but presenting them in a fun
          and playful light now is far more productive than waiting for more advanced
          opportunities.

        desc: โดยใช้เพียงแค่กระดาษและปากกา นักเรียนจะได้เรียนรู้เกี่ยวกับสี่ขั้นตอนของการคิดเชิงคำนวณอย่างเป็นระบบ
          (Computational Thinking) หลังจากบทนำสั้นๆ นักเรียนจะได้แบ่งกลุ่ม และออกคำสั่งให้นักเรียนคนอื่นๆ
          วาดมอนสเตอร์ตัวใดตัวหนึ่งจากรายการของมอนสเตอร์ที่มีจัดไว้ให้ กิจกรรมนี้จะถูกแยกออกเป็นส่วนๆ
          แต่ละกลุ่มจะวิเคราะห์มอนสเตอร์ในรายการ จากรูปแบบและรายละเอียดนามธรรมต่างๆของมอนสเตอร์
          แล้วนำข้อมูลที่ได้มาสร้างเป็นอัลกอริทึม (Algorithm) เพื่อให้อีกทีมหนึ่งวาด
          แต่ละทีมจะเปลี่ยนอัลกอริทึมเมื่อเปลี่ยนกลุ่มที่เล่นด้วย และวาดมอนสเตอร์ตามอัลกอริทึมที่ได้รับ
          ภาพที่วาดออกมาจะเหมือนกับที่ทีมที่ออกคำสั่งต้องการหรือไม่

          understand what programming is really about. The class will begin by students
          instructing each other to color squares in on graph paper in an effort to
          reproduce an existing picture.  If there's time, the lesson can conclude
          with images that the students create themselves.

          the first exercise will show how important it is to make each instruction
          as clear and unambiguous as possible.  Afterward, the class will explore
          how many ways you can fold paper into a rectangle, noting how some methods
          can take more or fewer folds than others.

        title: ฟังก์ชัน
        desc: In this lesson, students will make a suncatcher out of string, beads,
          and a special charm. The students will follow a series of repetitive steps,
          then be asked to identify certain sets of "skills" that are duplicated several
          times. Once those skills are defined, they will be called from a main program
          and the whole beautiful process of creation will be recorded on a single
          sheet of paper. The final program will be geared toward the entire class,
          whatever their type of string, beads, and charms. To effectively allow for
          this, students will need to "abstract out" the details of their specific
          materials and create vague terms for an individual's supplies.  This use
          of generic placeholders is a wonderful introduction to variables.

          courses taught students that information can be represented in a variety
          of binary options.  This lesson takes that concept one step further as it
          illustrates how a computer can store even more complex information (such
          as images and colors) in binary, as well.

          For this session we'll use a tool called "Swipe Right for CS", which has been developed by our partners at MIT. In Swipe Right for CS, you will read through some student profiles and consider specific statements that you might use to convince him or her to enroll in your CS Principles course. \r
          \r
          ### How it Works\r
          When playing the Swipe Right for CS game you will see a series of quotes that you might say to each student. You will swipe right on quotes that you think would be effective in convincing students to enroll in the course and swipe left on statements that you think will not be effective. During the session we will discuss as a group your thoughts on the types of statements that are most effective in getting a student to enroll in CS, and you will have a chance to see how other people in your workshop swiped on each of the arguments. \r

          ## Swipe Right for CS\r
          For this session we'll use a tool called "Swipe Right for CS", which has been developed by our partners at MIT. In Swipe Right for CS, you will read through some student profiles and consider specific statements that you might use to convince him or her to enroll in your CS Principles course. \r
          \r
          ### How it Works\r
          When playing the Swipe Right for CS game you will see a series of quotes that you might say to each student. You will swipe right on quotes that you think would be effective in convincing students to enroll in the course and swipe left on statements that you think will not be effective. During the session we will discuss as a group your thoughts on the types of statements that are most effective in getting a student to enroll in CS, and you will have a chance to see how other people in your workshop swiped on each of the arguments. \r

          When you click continue below, we'll send you to the game, and pass along the Code.org email address you're logged in with.

          process as follows:\r
          1. started with an `unplugged` level. populated with info. hit save and publish.\r
          2. “destroyed” the level\r
          3. made a `markdown` level with the same content and same name. checked to box to encrypt it. hit save and plush

      PlantASeed_2018:
        title: 'วิธีคิด (Algorithms)ในชีวิตจริง: ต้นไม้ และ เมล็ดพันธุ์'
        desc: This lesson calls out ways we use algorithms in our daily lives, using
          the act of planting a seed as an example. It also focuses on the bigger
          picture of computer science and how algorithms play an essential part.
      UnplugHappyMaps_2018:
        title: แผนที่แห่งความสุข
        desc: Students create simple algorithms (sets of instructions) to move a character
          through a maze using a single command.
      GoingPlacesSafely_2018:
        title: Going Places Safely
        desc: The Internet is a powerful, but sometimes dangerous place. Teachers
          introduce how to stay safe while navigating the Internet.
      courseA_unplugged_loops_2018:
        title: Loops Unplugged
        desc: In this lesson, you will learn about loops!
      BigEvent_2018:
        title: เหตุการณ์ใหญ่
        desc: Students are introduced to the programming concept of "events," which
          are actions that a computer constantly monitors for. The teacher will press
          buttons on a paper remote and students will react depending on which button
          is pressed.
      GraphPaperProgramming_2018:
        title: การเขียนกระดาษกราฟ
        desc: Students write an algorithm (a set of instructions) using a set of predefined
          commands to direct their classmates to reproduce a drawing.

      Conditionals_2018:
        title: เงื่อนไข
        desc: To learn about conditional statements, students play a card game and
          create rules like "If I draw a red card, I get a point" and "If I draw a
          black card, you get a point."
      DigitalFootprint_2018:
        title: Your Digital Footprint
        desc: Teachers introduce to students the idea that putting information about
          themselves online creates a digital footprint or "trail" that has consequences.
      BinaryImages_2018:
        title: Binary Images
        desc: Though many people think of binary as strictly zeros and ones, our previous
          courses taught students that information can be represented in a variety
          of binary options.  This lesson takes that concept one step further as it
          illustrates how a computer can store even more complex information (such
          as images and colors) in binary, as well.
      PaperPlanes_2018:
        title: 'Real-life Algorithms: Paper Planes'
        desc: This lesson calls out ways we use algorithms in our daily lives, specifically
          making paper airplanes. This lesson also focuses on the bigger picture of
          computer science and how algorithms play an essential part.
      GettingLoopy_2018:
        title: Getting Loopy
        desc: This lesson introduces the programming concept of loops (repeated instructions)
          through a dance activity. Students will learn simple choreography, then
          be instructed to repeat it.
      BinaryBracelets_2018:
        title: Binary Bracelets
        desc: Students create bracelets as a binary representations of the first letter
