# Introducing the concept of lists in CS Principles
**Goals:** The purpose of this section is to understand how the concept of a list is presented to students in the Code.org curriculum. *(Estimated time: ~55 minutes.)*

## Context
In your synchronous workshop, a facilitator will lead a modified “Model Lesson” and you will be acting as a learner.  This Model Lesson will be for U5L2 - Lists Investigate.  In preparation for this experience, you should first understand the content that precedes the Model Lesson as well as have a broad understanding of the unit as a whole.

As you do these activities, consider how the content connects between units and anticipate what aspects of this content may be challenging for students.


## Do this: 

1. Read the unit landing page for [Unit 4](https://curriculum.code.org/csp-20/unit4/). This will help you understand what experiences students will have leaving Unit 4 and entering into Unit 5.
2. Read the unit landing page for [Unit 5](https://curriculum.code.org/csp-20/unit5/). This will give you context for the lessons you will see over the course of the next two modules.
3. Read the [U5L1 - Lists Explore lesson plan](https://curriculum.code.org/csp-20/unit5/1/).  As you read the lesson plan, match the lesson plan with the slides for the lesson.
4. Watch the [U5L1 - Lists Explore video]().  This is found under the “Lesson Modifications” in the lesson plan. We recommend using the [digital manipulatives](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1i4f64rzZlaL_OxaNtXgfWcdp4hFcWXgsUvBClhTsHyM/edit?usp=sharing) to get a better feel for how students will engage in the concept of a list. (See the note below about the purpose behind this video). 
5. When finished with the above tasks, complete the two following reflections in this module.

*Note: This video is included as a “Lesson Modification” for teachers who are unable to teach in person.  If you are able to teach in-person or in a virtual synchronous environment, we do not recommend showing the video to students but rather having students engage with the content in a hands-on way as described in the original lesson plan.*
