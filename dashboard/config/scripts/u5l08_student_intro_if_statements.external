# Unit 5: Lesson 8 - If Statements Unplugged

## Background

We take a whole lesson to learn about `if` statements, what they are, the terminology around them, and what they have to do with “Selection” in programs. We trace simple robot programs on paper to develop a sense of how to read and reason about code with `if` statements in it.

## Lesson

* Introduction to `if` statements with the AP pseduocode
* A worked example with `if` statements and the "robot"
* "Will it Crash?" Activity

## Vocabulary

* **`if` Statement** - The common programming structure that implements "conditional statements".
* **Conditionals** - Another term for `if` statements -- statements that only run under certain conditions.
* **Selection** - A generic term for a type of programming statement (usually an if-statement) that uses a Boolean condition to determine, or select, whether or not to run a certain block of statements.
