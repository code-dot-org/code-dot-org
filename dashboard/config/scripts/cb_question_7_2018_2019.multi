A certain social media Web site allows users to post messages and to comment on other messages that have been posted. When a user posts a message, the message itself is considered data. In addition to the data, the site stores the following meta data.

- The time the message was posted
- The name of the user who posted the message
- The names of any users who comment on the message and the times the comments were made
