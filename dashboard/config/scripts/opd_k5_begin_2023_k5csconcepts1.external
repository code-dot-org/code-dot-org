# Algorithms

Congratulations! You just wrote an algorithm! **Algorithm** is a key term used in computer science. Algorithms are like **step-by-step recipes** for solving problems. It's a clear set of instructions that tells you what to do, just like following a recipe to bake cookies. Creating an algorithm is like **giving directions to a computer** so it knows exactly what steps to take.

You just created an algorithm for Laurel to get to the treasure. 
Letâ€™s create another algorithm.
