# Task: Become a verified teacher

## Code.orgâ€™s CS Principles course offers additional materials for Code.org teachers that have become 'verified teachers'. 

### These materials include:

* #### Student assessments and surveys.
* #### Example solutions and answer keys.
* #### The ability to leave feedback for students on levels.
* #### Teaching tips.
* #### And more!

### If you are not already a verified teacher, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdGGAJuaDMBVIRYnimPhAL96w6fCl4UdvhwmynGONM75TWwWw/viewform" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >click here</a> to complete the form to become a verified teacher.

**Note:** We try to process requests for teacher verification as fast as we can but because it is a manual process, it can take up to 7 business days to complete. <a href="https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/115001550131-Becoming-a-verified-teacher-CS-Principles-and-CS-Discoveries-only-" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Click here</a> for more information including a list of frequently asked questions.
