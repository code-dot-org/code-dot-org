# Programming - Interactive Games and Animations: Lesson 18 - Project - Design a Game

## Background

Students will plan and build their own game using the project guide from the previous two lessons to guide their project. Working individually or in pairs, students will first decide on the type of game they’d like to build, taking as inspiration a set of sample games. They will then complete a blank project guide where they will describe the game’s behavior and scope out the variables, sprites, and functions they’ll need to build. In Code Studio, a series of levels prompts them on a general sequence they can use to implement this plan. Partway through the process, students will share their projects for peer review and will incorporate feedback as they finish their game. At the end of the lesson, students will share their completed games with their classmates. This project will span multiple classes and can easily take anywhere from 3-5 class periods.
