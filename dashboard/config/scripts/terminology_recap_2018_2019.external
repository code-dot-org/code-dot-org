# Pause and Recap

Messages encrypted with the **Caesar cipher** are very easy to crack, especially with a computational tool. Now that you've had a little practice cracking an alphabetic shift cipher (pretty easy, huh?) let's try something more difficult.

**Recap terminology:**

* **Encryption** - a process of encoding messages to keep them secret, so only "authorized" parties can read it.
* **Decryption** - a process that reverses encryption, taking a secret message and reproducing the original plain text
* **Cipher** - the generic term for a technique (or algorithm) that performs encryption
* **Caesar's Cipher** - a technique for encryption that shifts the alphabet by some number of characters.
* **Cracking encryption** - When you attempt to decode a secret message *without* knowing all the specifics of the cipher, you are trying to **crack** the encryption.
