## Computer Programs and Following Directions

In Unit 1 Day 15-16, students investigate algorithms and simple computer programs.

### Additional Resources

#### Assessment

An great assessment or assignment is to ask students to study an existing language that is used to communicate instructions for an every-day activity. Recipes, sheet music, schedules, and driving directions all use an unambiguous language to communicate instructions for complicated tasks. The words in these languages - tablespoon, crescendo, AM/PM, Interstate Highway - each communicate a specific action or object required to succeed at a task.

Have students choose an item to study from one of the four above categories (recipe, sheet music, schedule, driving directions). Each student should select and define 5 words or symbols unique to the language of their item. Students should then explain three ways the language is still ambiguous or open to interpretation.

<strong>Example:</strong>

Item: Driving directions from Baltimore, MD, USA to the White House, DC, USA

Words:

1. *Turn Left* - At an intersection of two roads, take the left fork relative to your current direction of travel
1. *West* - The compass direction corresponding to the direction of the setting sun
1. *Zip Code* - A group of five numbers corresponding to an area in the United States 
1. *Mile* - A distance measurement corresponding to 5280 feet or 1.60934 kilometers
1. *Lane* - A division in a road used to separate lines of traffic

Ambiguities:

1. An instruction to turn left or right does not specify how far the person should turn (i.e. 90 degrees or 70 degrees).
1. Driving directions allow a person to interpret how fast or slow they should drive and whether or not they should slow down for a turn.
1. Driving directions only specify changes of course and do not specify decisions a driver should make between those changes of course (i.e. whether a driver should change lanes to avoid traffic)

<strong>Discussion:</strong>

If we want to create a self-driving car or a robot that reads sheet music, we will not only need to define all words and symbols in the corresponding language, but also define which actions should be carried out when when the language is ambiguous.

### Extended Resources

Below, you will find a TEDx video of Christopher Steiner talking about Algorithms and their uses. You might consider showing this video to your students to encourage further discussion on algorithms and their uses.
