# Get to know the available resources

You are not alone in supporting students with developing these skills and reinforcing content knowledge.  Code.org has provided resources to support students and many other resources exist in the CS community to support students as well. 

**Code.org-created resources and materials:**

* <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/csp10-2020/lockable/1/levels/2/page/1" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Multiple Choice Assessment at the end of Unit 10</a> has a total of two reading passages and 10 questions that mirror the “Single-select questions with reading passage” question type students will see on the exam.
* Unit 5, Lesson 5 students used some of the “robot code” in the Loops Explore to practice using loops and the pseudocode featuring the robot.
* Additionally, the checks for understanding or the multiple choice assessments had a few “select two options” questions.

**Resources available outside of Code.org:**
