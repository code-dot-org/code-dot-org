### PLANNING > Exploring Teacher Resources
<br><br>
Now that you have a firm grasp on how to code, as well as some beginning understandings of how to teach computer science, it's time to start planning your instruction.
<br><br>
By completing Stage 10, you will:

- Explore Code Studio and [Teacher Dashboard](http://code.org/teacher-dashboard#/) resources
- Plan for how you might integrate computer science into your practice

Throughout Stages 4-8, you took a look at some of the "unplugged" and online learning resources available in Code Studio, as they aligned with the computer science concepts you were learning. In this stage, we'll be touring the rest of Code Studio and the [Teacher Dashboard](http://code.org/teacher-dashboard#/).

<br><br>
When you're logged into Code Studio as a teacher, you have access to many features that your students do not. We will explore those features in this stage. Let's start first with an overview. Here are the tiles on the Teacher Dashboard:

- [Student Accounts and Progress](http://code.org/teacher-dashboard#/sections): Create sections for each of your classes, and assess the learning of all of your students.
- [Your Course Progress](http://studio.code.org/): View your own personal progress on Code Studio lessons, as a learner. Your students also have access to this tile. However, as a teacher, the only difference you'll see from the student view is that you are able to view lesson plans and see the solutions for every puzzle.
- [Lesson Plans and Resources](http://code.org/teacher-dashboard#/plan): Access lessons plans, an implementation guide, handouts for students and teachers, standards alignment for Code Studio courses, video FAQs and more.
- [Help and Community](https://support.code.org/hc/communities/public/topics): Connect to support.code.org, where you can post questions, respond to other teacher's posts, and read FAQs by Code.org staff. On this page, you'll also be able to directly contact Code.org with any questions you may have.
- [Professional Development](http://code.org/educate/professional-development): Access free training resources for teachers, including this online workshop.
- [Computer Science Guest Speakers](https://education.skype.com/computerscience): Find smart, passionate and engaging tech industry professionals who would love to talk to your class about their jobs.
