#### When we think about the role identity plays in the classroom, we need to consider both our own identities and how those impact our experiences with students in the classrooms as well as how studentsâ€™ identities impact their experiences in CS. In module 2, we talked about the role and responsibility we play in actively creating a classroom culture of inclusion in our CS classrooms, but even despite our best intentions, we can fall short of that goal. One factor we should consider when creating an inclusive classroom is the role Unconscious Bias plays in the decisions we make in our classrooms. We are going to start by watching a video to frame this discussion.
