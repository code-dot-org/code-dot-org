#####  Most people think of coding when they think of computer science. 
##While coding is a big part of computer science, there's so much more to it. 
##### Computer science is like a big playground with various areas to explore.  With fields like Data Science, Cybersecurity, hardware and software engineering, and even Artificial Intelligence, **computer science is a combination of creativity, problem solving, and exploration.** 

##### In this module, we are going to breakdown foundational concepts in coding and practice building these skills with block code in Maze lab. To learn about other aspects of computer science, check out our other Professional Learning opportunities <a href="https://code.org/educate/professional-development-online">here</a>. 


##Remember, coding is writing instructions to a computer in a language it understands (code) and the language we will use is block code.
