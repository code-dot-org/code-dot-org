# Unit 1: Lesson 11 - Sending Formatted Text

## Background

ASCII encoding is the standard number-to-text encoding scheme used in computers and on the Internet. This protocol is 7 bits long and so can encode 128 different symbols, each corresponding to one of the binary numbers between 0 and 127. Originally the encoding was designed for older printers and so the codes associated with the numbers 0-31 were designated as "control codes" which instruct the printer to perform certain actions. These codes are now largely out of use. Codes 32-126, however, contain many of the most commonly used symbols you use on the internet, including the lowercase and capital letters, the numbers 0-9, and most commonly-used punctuation marks. Perhaps more remarkably, this printable character set is also used to represent all of the text formatting we use to add variety and emphasis to "plain-text" documents. The ability to represent formatting using only ASCII symbols is the result of cleverly designed protocols.

## Lesson

* Learn about the ASCII encoding scheme.
* Invent a text formatting language
* Design a protocol for sending formatted text.
* Discover the challenges of encoding meta-information.
