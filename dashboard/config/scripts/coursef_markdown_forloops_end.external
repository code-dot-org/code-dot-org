# **You just learned "for loops"!**

### **For loops are loops where you set the start, stop, and step values.**

### This new kind of `repeat` loop gives you more control over when you loop starts, when it ends, and what your loop should increase by every time it runs.

### More control means you can solve puzzles a lot faster!
