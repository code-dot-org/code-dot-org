# Wrap up

You just finished the first module of the asynchronous post-work!  We hope to see you at the next synchronous call with your cohort.  During this call you will:

* Check in with other members of your cohort and collaboratively address challenges in your classrooms
* Use The Theater, a package used in Java Lab to create animations and sounds
* Read documentation from The Theater to create your own animation
* Learn about the Unit 4 project where students create their own animation to illustrate data

See you there!
