**Explanation:** Since this is an example of event-driven programming, the commands on lines 4 and 5 will only execute when the user clicks the “topButton” since they are inside the `onEvent` block. Since this question asks about the situation of the user NOT clicking the button, the last change to the color happens when line 2 executes and sets it to blue.

[Lesson 6 - Intro to Programming](https://studio.code.org/s/csp3-2022/lessons/6) showed students examples of programs like this one.

CRD-2.C.5: In event-driven programming, program statements are executed when triggered rather than through the sequential flow of control.
