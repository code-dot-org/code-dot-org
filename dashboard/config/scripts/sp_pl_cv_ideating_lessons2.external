#### In this lesson, students explore the role of datasets in **training computer vision models** and learn how to evaluate the suitability of datasets for specific applications. 

#### The lesson includes hands-on exploration of datasets and **object detection models**.

#### By the end of this lesson, students should be able to assess the relevance and quality of a dataset for solving a particular problem in computer vision.

#### In this lesson, students explore how **biases in training data** can affect the performance and fairness of computer vision applications using practical activities like the COCO dataset exploration and Auto-Doggie Door model testing. 

#### By the end of this lesson, students should be able to recognize bias in datasets and understand strategies to reduce its impact.
