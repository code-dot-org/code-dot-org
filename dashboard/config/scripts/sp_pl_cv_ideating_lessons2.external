#### In this lesson, students explore the role of datasets in **training computer vision models** and learn how to evaluate the suitability of datasets for specific applications. The lesson includes hands-on exploration of the COCO dataset and **object detection models** using MediaPipe, allowing students to understand the practical aspects of using pre-trained models and the importance of confidence scores in model predictions. 

#### By the end of this lesson, students should be able to assess the relevance and quality of a dataset for solving a particular problem in computer vision.

#### This lesson addresses the critical topic of **bias** in computer vision systems. Students explore how biases in training data can affect the performance and fairness of computer vision applications using practical activities like the COCO dataset exploration and Auto-Doggie Door model testing. 

#### Students engage in discussions and activities designed to identify potential biases and propose methods to mitigate them, ensuring more **equitable technology solutions**. By the end of this lesson, students should be able to recognize bias in datasets and understand strategies to reduce its impact.
