# Lesson Investigation 

#### Now that we have had a chance to see some of the lessons in action and look under the hood at the philosophy behind Code.orgâ€™s CSA, we are going to shift to giving you time to explore these resources for yourself.

#### You will use the lesson investigation resource on pages 38-40 of your <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13Ioyv4xcUUunhZ9034eNvm9QNpRYQYnyha1UtS5eixA/edit?usp=drive_link" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Activity Packet</a> to complete this activity. Complete only one of the four lesson investigation documents
