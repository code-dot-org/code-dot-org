# Making Data Visualizations

There are many different kinds of charts that are used to visualize data. In this lesson, you will learn to make scatter, line, and bar charts, but there are many other types of visualizations that people use to interpret data in different ways. Look through the <a href="http://content.visage.co/hs-fs/hub/424038/file-2094950163-pdf" target="_blank">Data Visualization 101 Guide</a> and familiarize yourself with the different chart types, paying particular attention to the scatter, line, and bar charts.

* **Disclaimer:** This lesson is about using charts to explore trends in the data - **not about creating the worldâ€™s greatest chart**. While the early parts of the lesson will walk you through very specific steps to make a particular chart, by the end of the lesson you will be creating your own customized charts to **see what trends you can discover in the data**.
