Internet Protocol version 4 (IPV4) uses a 32 bit binary number to represent an IP address. Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6 ) uses a 128 bit binary number to represent the same. Which one of the following BEST describes the reason for this changeover in IP address representation?

Learning Objective: **6.1.1** and Essential Knowledge statements: **6.1.1H**
<hr>
 (A) This is incorrect. Increasing the number of bits to represent the IP address will increase the number of available addresses exponentially - 2^(129-32) = 2^96 more addresses.

<hr>
 (B) This is incorrect. Increasing the number of bits to represent the IP address will increase the number of available addresses exponentially - 2^(129-32) = 2^96 more addresses.

<hr>
 (C) This is incorrect. Increasing the number of bits to represent the IP address will increase the number of available addresses exponentially - 2^(129-32) = 2^96 more addresses.

 (D) This is correct. Increasing the number of bits to represent the IP address will increase the number of available addresses exponentially - 2^(129-32) = 2^96 more addresses.
