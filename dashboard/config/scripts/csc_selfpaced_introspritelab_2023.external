# Introducing Sprite Lab

#### Sprite Lab is a block-based programming environment that allows students to create simple animations and games with objects and characters that interact with each other. Students learn about sprites, sprite behaviors, and events. A **sprite** is an image or character in your coding program. An **event** in computer science is an action that causes something to happen.
