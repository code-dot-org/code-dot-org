### FUNCTIONS > Reflection
<br><br>

In this stage, we explored how functions can make you a faster programmer by allowing you to reuse segments of your code. In the next stage, we’ll look at the core concept of “events” and put your coding skills to the test.**Take a moment now to review how functions are introduced in the code.org curriculum.** As you explore the resources below, consider how you might implement the suggested activities in your classroom.

#### Unplugged Lesson Plans

**1. Review "Functional Suncatchers" Lesson Plan:** [Course 3](https://code.org/curriculum/course3/4/Teacher)
