# Functions > Reflection

In this stage, we explored how functions can make you a faster and better programmer by allowing you to reuse segments of your code. In the next stage, weâ€™ll look at the core concept of **events** and put your coding skills to the test.  

**Take a moment now to review how functions are introduced in the Code.org curriculum.** As you explore the resources below, consider how you might implement the suggested activities in your classroom.
