#### In synchronous and asynchronous portions of the workshop, you've had the opportunity to reflect on your position as a CS teacher. We've focused on increasing access, diversity, and inclusion in your classroom and school. This asynchronous module continues the thread of equity.

#### While this module is about bias and responsibility, this is **not** an indictment on your character or teaching ability. Rather, consider this a safe space to reflect on your teaching experiences thus far and how you can continuously improve.

#### At any given time, there are hundreds of things happening in your classroom - some of those things you can see and other things you cannot. Because there is so much going on, and we have a lot of teaching to do, we sometimes make assumptions in the classroom.

#### **It is normal, and at times necessary, to make assumptions.**
