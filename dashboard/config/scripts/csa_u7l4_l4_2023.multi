Consider the following `PromTickets` class.

```
public class PromTickets {
    private int availableTickets;
    private int soldTickets;

    public PromTickets(int totalTickets) {
        availableTickets = totalTickets;
        soldTickets = 0;
    }

    private void sellTicket() {
        if (availableTickets > 0) {
            availableTickets--;
            soldTickets++;
            System.out.println("Ticket sold! Remaining tickets: " + availableTickets);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Sorry, tickets are sold out.");
        }
    }
}
```

The following code segment appears in a class other than `PromTickets`.

```
PromTickets tickets = new PromTickets(100);
tickets.sellTicket();
tickets.sellTicket();
tickets.sellTicket();
System.out.println("Total tickets sold: " + tickets.soldTickets);
```

Which of the following best describes the reason why this code segment does not run?

teacher_markdown <<MARKDOWN
The `sellTicket()` method is marked as `private`, which means it cannot be accessed outside of the `PromTickets` class. Therefore, attempting to call `tickets.sellTicket()` will result in a compile-time error. The correct solution is to mark the `sellTicket()` method as `public` so that it can be called from outside the class.
