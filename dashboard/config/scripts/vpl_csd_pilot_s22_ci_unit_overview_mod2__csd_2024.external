In <b>Unit 2 - Web Development</b>, students are empowered to create and share content on their own web pages. They begin by thinking about the role of the internet and how it can be used as a medium for creative expression. As students develop their pages and begin to see themselves as programmers, they are encouraged to think critically about the impact of sharing information online and how to be <b>critical consumers of content</b>.

Students are also introduced to problem solving as it relates to programming while they learn valuable skills such as debugging, using resources, and teamwork. At the conclusion of the unit, students will have created a personal website they can publish and share.
