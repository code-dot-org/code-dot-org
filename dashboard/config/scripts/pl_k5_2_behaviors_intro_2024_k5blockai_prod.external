# Whoa! There’s no way I can teach all of that! 

## Don’t worry; this module focuses on foundational AI concepts: How AI Makes Decisions.




#### Here are the major takeaways covered in the module: 

#### <b>Big Idea #1:</b> Understanding what data a computer will need in order to make predictions in the future.
#### <b>Big Idea #2:</b> There is a human component to training a model, thus, any human bias may be reflected in the predictions the computer makes. 
#### <b>Big Idea #3:</b> Sometimes AI gets it wrong in a way that a human wouldn’t. 

## Main Ideas to Reinforce with Students:
#### 👷 AI can help us automate tasks
#### 📊 Machine learning algorithms require data provided to it by humans
#### ⠳ AI makes predictions based on patterns it has seen from large datasets
#### ❌ AI can sometimes be wrong or unfair
#### 🪄 AI is not magical or random
