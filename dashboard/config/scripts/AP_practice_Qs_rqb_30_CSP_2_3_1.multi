right 'Models and simulations often omit unnecessary features of the objects or phenomena under investigation.'
wrong 'Writing very detailed models and simulations will help minimize costs as they are easier to write than more abstract models and simulations.'
right 'Simple models and simulations will execute faster allowing more opportunity for rapid testing and development.'
wrong 'Less abstract models and simulations omit details to simplify the study of the objects or processes involved.'
markdown <<MARKDOWN
You have been hired by a company to generate a simulation of a process within their multinational company.  You try to convince them that there is significant value to starting with a simple model even though it might not model their process exactly.  Which arguments below are viable supports for your position?  
Select two answers.

Learning Objective: **2.3.1** and Essential Knowledge statements: **2.3.1A**
<hr>
 (A) This option is correct.  Models and simulations often cannot include all the details of the real-world phenomena as to do so would take too much time or effort with little return.

<hr>
 (B) This option is incorrect. The more details that are left out of a simulation or model, the easier the code is to write and cheaper to produce.

<hr>
 (C) This option is correct. Less detailed models or simulations take less compute time allowing for more iteration.

<hr>
 (D) This option is incorrect. More abstract models or simulations omit details, not less abstract models and simulations.
