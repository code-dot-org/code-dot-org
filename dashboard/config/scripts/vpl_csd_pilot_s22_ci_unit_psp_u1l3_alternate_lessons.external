# Chapter 1: The problem Solving Process 

##### Chapter 1 of the Problem Solving and Computing unit provides students with strategies and processes to use to become more effective problem solvers. Students will draw upon these foundational skills in all other units of the CS Discoveries course. This is why, it is recommended to always begin with this chapter when teaching any CS Discoveries content. 

## Lessons 1 - 3

##### Chapter 1 of the Problem Solving and Computing unit consists of three lessons. Throughout the chapter, students will solve problems that require them to define their goals, devise a plan, try a solution, evaluate their results, and then iteratively improve from there.

**Question of the Day:** What can help us to work together and solve problems as a team?

**Lesson Overview:**

In this lesson, students work in groups to design aluminum foil boats that will support as many pennies as possible. Groups have two rounds to work on their boats, with the goal of trying to hold more pennies than they did in round 1. The structure of the activity foreshadows different steps of the problem solving process that students will be introduced to in more detail in the following lesson. At the end of the lesson students reflect on their experiences with the activity and make connections to the types of problem solving they will be doing for the rest of the course

Alternate versions of this lesson are also available.

* Newspaper Table
* Spaghetti Bridge
* Paper Tower

**Students will be able to:** 
* Communicate and collaborate with classmates in order to solve a problem
* Identify different strategies used to solve a problem
* Iteratively improve a solution to a problem

**Question of the Day:** What are some common steps we can use to solve many different types of problems?

**Lesson Overview:**

This lesson introduces the formal problem solving process that students will use over the course of the year, Define - Prepare - Try - Reflect. The lesson begins by asking students to brainstorm all the different types of problems that they encounter in everyday life. Students are then shown the four steps of the problem solving process and work together to relate these abstract steps to their actual experiences solving problems. First students relate these steps to the problem activities from the previous lesson, then a problem they are good at solving, then a problem they want to improve at solving. At the end of the lesson the class collects a list of generally useful strategies for each step of the process to put on posters that will be used throughout the unit and year.

**Students will be able to:**
* Given a problem, identify individual actions that would fall within each step of the problem solving process
* Identify useful strategies within each step of the problem solving process

**Question of the Day:** How can we apply the problem solving process to many different kinds of problems?

**Lesson Overview:**

In this lesson students apply the problem solving process to three different problems in order to better understand the value of each step. They will solve a word search, arrange seating for a birthday party, and redesign a classroom. The problems grow increasingly complex and poorly defined to highlight how the problem solving process is particularly helpful when tackling these types of problems. The lesson concludes with students reflecting on their experience with the problem solving process. They will justify the inclusion of each step and will brainstorm questions or strategies that can help them better define open-ended problems, as this is often the most critical step.

Alternate versions of this lesson are also available.

* Animal Theme
* Games Theme

**Students will be able to:**
* Apply the problem solving process to approach a variety of problems
* Assess how well-defined a problem is and use strategies to define the problem more precisely

## Alternate Lessons

##### Alternate versions of Lessons 1 and 3 are available, and they target the same learning goals. Teachers may choose which lesson to implement based on the availability of supplies or student interests. Chapter 1 of Unit 1 can be used as a review for students who have already taken a portion of the Computer Science Discoveries course in a different grade level or semester. In this case, the teacher can substitute in a different lesson from the one that students have already completed.
