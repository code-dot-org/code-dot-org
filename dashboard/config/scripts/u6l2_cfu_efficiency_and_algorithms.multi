name 'U6L2 CFU Efficiency and Algorithms'
question 'Which of the following is true of two algorithms designed to solve the same problem?'
wrong 'If two algorithms solve the same problem they must have the same efficiency'
wrong 'If two algorithms solve the same problem they must have different efficiency'
wrong 'For any given problem there is a single algorithm that can solve it with a single efficiency'
right 'It is possible for two algorithms with different efficiencies to solve the same problem'
