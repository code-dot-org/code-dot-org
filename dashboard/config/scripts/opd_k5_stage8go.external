# Best Practices > Reflection

Stage 8 introduced you to a number of best practices for teaching computer science. Take a moment to consider which strategies covered in this stage you might use in your practice. In the next stage, you'll create a simple plan and reflect on the course as a whole.

## What strategies will you use when facilitating computer science learning in your classroom?

Here are some examples from our teacher community:

- Facilitate "unplugged" activities to teach core concepts (see [Unplugged Activities](https://code.org/curriculum/unplugged) for more information.)
- Implement the "Ask 3 and then me" rule in your classroom, which is when students have to ask 3 classmates for help before they can ask the teacher that same question. This reduces the number of students that you have to answer individually and promotes peer learning.
- Be calm yet persistent when problems arise (which they will.) Your reaction sets the tone for students. If at the first sign of an issue, you proclaim "I'm terrible at technology. I give up," your students will think it's okay to do that too.
- Take pride in their programs. Show them off, put them to work, post them online. This is a big accomplishment for you and your students that should be celebrated.
- Ask probing questions to a student (even if you don't know the answer to the questions.) Ask your class if anyone has the answer. Get comfortable saying "I don't know; let's figure this out together!"
