#Conclusions and Connections 

##### The calendars below provide a look at the lesson progressions for **Unit 6 - Creating Apps with Devices**.  Notice you have investigated many of the lessons in **Chapter 1** during asynchronous Modules 5 and 6.  The unit's concepts build towards cumulative projects at the end of each chapter.

##### **Chapter 1** focuses on programming with hardware and by the end, students should be able to build a game within Code Studio that uses the inputs and outputs of the Circuit Playground. 

##### We will explore **Chapter 2** in the Module 6 synchronous workshop. 

#####  The following levels focus on the end-of-Chapter 1 project, **Human Device Interaction**, to identify what students are working towards and what will be assessed and how.
