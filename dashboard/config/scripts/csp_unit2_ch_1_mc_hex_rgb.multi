An artist makes an RGB raster image in which each pixel color is encoded with *12-bits* â€” 4 bits each for red, green and blue.  

Which of the following correctly shows the **hexadecimal value for Red as a *12-bit* representation.**

The correct answer is `F00`.  A single hex digit is used to represent a 4-bit sequence - since there are 16 possible 4-bit sequences and 16 different hex digits 0-F.  

So 3 hex digits represents 12 bits, and the first digit represents the intensity of Red in an RGB image.
