Jasmine is writing a shopping app.  She has created a variable to keep track of the number of items in the shopping cart.  Every time someone clicks the “addItemButton”, she would like the variable to increase by 1.

What code should Jasmine insert where it says `<missing code>` in order for her app to work?

Since Jasmine wants to increase the cartTotal by one every time the "addItemButton" is clicked, the new cartTotal should be the current cartTotal plus one. In other words,

_cartTotal = cartTotal + 1;_

Since the variable cartTotal is already initialized in line 1, the word "var" is not necessary because that would create a new local variable instead of adding on to the existing cartTotal.
