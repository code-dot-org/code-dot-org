# Lessons 1-3 > Extra Practice with Circles

Depending on the age range and skill level of your students they may dive into the Circles of Evaluation with abandon and be ready for the online environment in no time, but you may want to invest more time in practicing with the Circles, particularly for students weak on Order of Operations. For those students, the folks at [Bootstrap](http://www.bootstrapworld.org) have come up with a ton of great supplimental materials that you could use.
