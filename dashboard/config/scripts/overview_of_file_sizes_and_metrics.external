# Overview of File Size and Metrics

When data (an image, picture, sound, etc.)  is stored in computer memory, resources have to be allocated for that storage.  The amount of memory require varies, depending on the type and amount of data being stored. The amount of memory used to store a file is called the *file size*.  Like other measurable quantities, there’s a standard unit used to describe the size of digital files: the byte.  A byte is actually made up of smaller units: bits, which represent two possible states.  A byte is made up of eight bits and therefore is often used to represent numbers between 0 and 255 (because you with 8 bits you can represent all of the numbers from 0 - 255).  Frequently, however, many bytes are needed to represent all of the data in a file.  To name these groups of bytes, we use ‘kilo-’, ‘mega-’, ‘giga-’, and ‘tera-’ prefixes similar to other units of measurement like meters or watts. Note that there are some discrepancies in common usage of the kilo, mega, giga prefixes, as described in the followingexerpt from the  <a href=”https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs101/bits-gigabytes.html” target=_blank> Stanford CS 101 website: </a>


<div style="margin-left:15px"> <h2><i class="fa fa-quote-left" aria-hidden="true"></i></h2></div> <div style="float:right; margin-left:25px"> It’s convenient within the computer to organize things in groups of powers of 2. For example, 2\^10 is 1024, and so a program might group 1024 items together, as a sort of “round” number of things within the computer. The term “kilobyte” above refers to this group size of 1024 things. However, people also group things by thousands – 1 thousand or 1 million items.
<br><br>
There’s this problem with the word “megabyte” .. does it mean 1024 * 1024 bytes, i.e. 2\^20 which is 1,048,576, or does it mean exactly 1 million, 1000 * 1000. It’s just a 5% difference, but marketers tend to prefer the 1 million, interpretation, since it makes their hard drives etc. appear to hold a little bit more. In an attempt to fix this, the terms “kibibyte” “mebibyte” “gibibyte” “tebibyte” have been introduced to specifically mean the 1024 based units (see wikipedia kibibyte article). These terms do not seem to have caught on very strongly thus far.
If nothing else, remember that terms like “megabyte” have this little wiggle room in them between the 1024 and 1000 based meanings. For purposes of CS Principles the distinction is not important - “about a million bytes” is a fine, close-enough interpretation for “megabyte”.<br><br></div>
