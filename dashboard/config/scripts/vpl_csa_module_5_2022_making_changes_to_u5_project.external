# Reviewing the rubric

Code.org provides rubrics for each of the end of Unit projects.  However, each school and teacher has their own approach to using and adapting these rubrics for their classrooms and students.  
 

## Do this:
1. Consider your response to the previous prompt.  What do you want students to do in the Unit 5 project? 
2. Review the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_pLVScOHrt4G8SzRUwizkf-UnQ_TqZ7nYWiF2s77CO8/edit?usp=sharing" target="blank">Unit 5 Project Planning Guide</a>.
3. Look for how the rubric in the Unit 5 Project Planning Guide matches or differs from your expectations for students.  The rubric is also shown below.

## Reflect:
1. How would you modify the Project Planning Guide to help your students accomplish the task?
2. How would you modify the rubric to the Unit 5 project (found on the last page of the planning guide) to help reinforce or clarify your expectations for students during this project?
3. Share any changes you plan on making to the project planning guide or rubric in the  <a href="https://forum.code.org/t/csa-unit-5-personal-narrative-project/" target="blank">Code.org Forum</a>.
