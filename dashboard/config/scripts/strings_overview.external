# Strings Overview and How To Guide

## Vocabulary: 

- **String:** an arbitrary-length sequence of ASCII characters. The characters used to indicate the beginning and end of a string are quotes: `""`. Example strings: `"hello"`, `"hello world!"`, `"This is a string"` The quotes are important to distinguish strings from things like variable names. So the variable name blue is different from the string `"blue"`
- **Concatenate:** to link together or join
- **String Concatenation:** In code, the act of bringing together multiple strings into one. 
 - This is often used to join a default string to something the user provided, such as `"hello " + username + "!"`, where the value of the variable username is a string. If the user provided the text `"Molly"` then the full string after concatenation would be `"hello Molly!"`

The primary data type students have used so far is **Numbers**. If we want to interact with user-submitted text, however, we'll need to learn about a new data type called a **String**.  A string is a **sequence of ASCII characters**.

**Example** | **Rule**
---|---
`"aString"` | Strings **might** look a lot like a variable name but there are **many differences**.
`"look at all these spaces"` | Strings can **contain spaces**.
`" bills are the coolest"` | Strings can **contain special characters** (and even start with them).
`"11"` | Strings might **contain only digits**. This looks like a number but it is really 2 ASCII characters.
`""` | Strings might **contain no characters**.

You can **store strings in a variable just like a number**. In this example the variable name is `str` but you should choose a name that is **descriptive and meaningful**.

**Combining Strings:** often you will want to combine multiple strings to create one longer string. You can do this with the `+` operator. The formal name of this process is **concatenation**.

## Importance of Double Quotes

You may have noticed that the strings we've seen are **wrapped in double quotes**. These double quotes **are not part of the string**. Instead this is how you indicate that a sequence of characters **is a string and not the name of a variable**.

As you start writing programs with strings **it is common to generate errors from forgetting to place them in double quotes**. We're going to generate some of those errors now so that we can recognize them more easily later.
