## What is AI? 

####**Block-based programming** is like building with digital blocks! Block-based programming simplifies coding for early learners through a visual, **drag-and-drop** interface, eliminating the need for writing exact words or symbols. 

## Why Use AI?
#### Block-based programming is great for beginners, making coding fun and easy with drag-and-drop methods. It's a good start for learning basic programming concepts, helping to **smoothly transition** to more advanced, text-based coding later.

## Examples of AI in Everyday Life
