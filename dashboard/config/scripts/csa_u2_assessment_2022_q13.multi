Consider the following class definition.

```
public class Mystery {
    private int x;
    // Constructor not shown.
}
```

Which of the following is a correct header for a method of the `Mystery` class that would change the value of the `private` instance variable `x` given an `int` argument so that it can be called from a class other than `Mystery`?
