# Variables Practice

The following links provide opportunities for you to practice using variables to store information.  All of these links are also found in the curriculum, but are consolidated here for convenience. (These are not ALL of the variables, but a sampling from multiple levels of difficulty to help you gather a broad understanding of events.)


### Stage 4
- <a href = “https://studio.code.org/s/csp5-2019/lessons/4/levels/4" target=_blank> Create a variable and assign a value to that variable <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a>
- <a href = “https://studio.code.org/s/csp5-2019/lessons/4/levels/5" target=_blank> Variables - Debugging <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a> -Debug one of the most common variables issues found in programmers' code.
- <a href = “https://studio.code.org/s/csp5-2019/lessons/4/levels/7" target=_blank> Initialize a Variable <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a>
- <a href = “https://studio.code.org/s/csp5-2019/lessons/4/levels/10" target=_blank> Variables and arithmetic expressions <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a> - **Note:** A variable does not store an expression, rather it evaluates the expression for a solution and stores that solution.
- <a href = “https://studio.code.org/s/csp5-2019/lessons/4/levels/15" target=_blank> Variables and User Input <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a>
- <a href = “https://studio.code.org/s/csp5-2019/lessons/4/levels/19" target=_blank> Variable Reassignment <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a> - Change the value stored in a particular variable
- <a href = “https://studio.code.org/s/csp5-2019/lessons/4/levels/21" target=_blank> Memory Challenge <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a> - For this challenge, do not change the lines of code that exist.  Rather add your own manipulation of the variables to make the print statement at the end correct.
