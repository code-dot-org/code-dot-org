# Naming UI Elements

<div style="background-color: #a6e3e8; border-radius: 40px; color: #000000; width: 95%; padding: 1px 20px 1px 20px;">

<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 18px; ">Design Mode in App Lab allows students to place a number of different types of User Interface (or UI) elements on the screen. Many of these elements can be used to take input from the user.
</p></div>

## Choosing Good IDs

##### Each UI element in an app needs an ID that students can refer to later. Good IDs are **meaningful, descriptive, and unique**. For example, if students have many buttons in their program, they will want to give each an ID that describes what the button does. 

##### So, instead of this:
 
 * ##### "button1" and "button2"

##### Students might make IDs that tell them not only that it's a button, but what they intend the button to be used for, like:

 * ##### "homeButton" and "saveButton" or
 * ##### "buttonHome" and "buttonSave" or
 * ##### "home\_button" and "save\_button"

## Rules About IDs

##### In making descriptive and meaningful IDs there **are some rules about IDs** students need to know.  IDs...

* ##### are case-sensitive.
* ##### cannot contain spaces.
* ##### *must* begin with a letter (A-Z or a-z) and may be followed by any number of digits and letters.
* ##### can contain hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons (":"), or periods (".").

<summary style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;">ðŸ”¤ Case-sensitive?</summary>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">
    <p>

##### This means there is a difference between "HomeButton" and "homeButton"  (notice the Capital H on the first one).

##### There are a few common styles for capitalizing and spelling multi-word IDs:

* **Capitalization (known as "camelCase")** -- "aCamelcaseNameMightLookLikeThis"
* **Underscores (known as "snake_case")** -- "some&#95;people&#95;like&#95;to&#95;use&#95;underscores&#95;to&#95;separate&#95;words"
* **Dashes (known as "kebab-case")** -- "others-like-to-use-hyphens-or-dashes"

<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">
    <p>

##### Ensuring that all students are both creating unique IDs for all elements and properly namespacing them will go a long way towards avoiding issues later in the unit. It pays to be a stickler here!
