The sprinklers at a park are supposed to turn on only when the temperature is at or less than 75 degrees. The following code is intended to print a message indicating whether or not the sprinklers are on, based on the temperature. Assume that the variable `degrees` has been properly declared and initialized with the outside temperature.

```
if (degrees < 75) {
   System.out.println("The sprinklers are on.");
}
else {
   System.out.println("The sprinklers are off.");
}
```

Which of the following initializations for `degrees`, if any, will demonstrate that the code segment may not work as intended?
