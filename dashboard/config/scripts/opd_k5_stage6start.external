In the first few stages, you’ve learned how to write a program, add loops, and use conditionals. In this stage, we’ll introduce the concept of **functions**.

By completing Stage 7, you will:

- Practice coding simple functions
- Reflect on classroom application

> **What to Expect in this Stage:** First, expect to practice with a program in Course D that does not include a function. Then you’ll learn about functions through video, and practice using functions in a variety of puzzles. We'll take a look at resources then reflect on your practice. You should spend between 20-45 minutes on this stage.

Ready? Let's go!
