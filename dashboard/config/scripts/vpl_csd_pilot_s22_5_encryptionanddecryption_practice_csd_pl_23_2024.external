# Encryption and Decryption

## Protecting Information with Encryption

#### Encrypted messages have been changed so that only some people are able to read them. We can use encryption to protect just the last row of our medical records so only a doctor can read them. In order to use encryption, we need to know the algorithm and the key.

#### The **algorithm** is the method that you use to hide your data.

#### Your **key** is the code that you use in the algorithm to keep your message secret.

### **Algorithm**	

* #### **Step 1:** Copy the encrypted message into the first row.
* #### **Step 2:** Copy the key into the second row, and keep repeating it until the end. Notice that in the below example, the key has been repeated twice, as indicated by the blue rectangles.
* #### **Step 2:** For each box in the third row: if the two boxes above it are the same (**both** white or **both** gray), color it gray.  Otherwise, leave it white.

## How to Interpret a Medical Record

#### Each medical record includes the following information about a patient:

* #### Have you ever been to the hospital? 
* #### Have you ever broken a bone? 
* #### Have you ever had a panic attack? 
* #### Have you ever had a dental cavity? 
* #### Have you ever had a serious sunburn? 
* #### Do you wear glasses? 
* #### Do you have asthma? 
* #### Do you have a severe allergy?

#### Each box in the medical record row corresponds with a question, with eight total questions. A gray square represents the answer "No", while a white square represents the answer "Yes". You can think of this like "on" and "off" pixels like you've seen before.

## Example

#### This example shows you how the algorithm is used to decrypt personal medical information.
