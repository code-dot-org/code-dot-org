Learning Objective: **2.1.1** and Essential Knowledge statements: **2.1.1D**
<hr>
 (A) CORRECT!  All ASCII characters are represented by 8 bit (1 byte) characters. For example  the character "A" is converts to 0100 0001 in binary, 065 in decimal and 041 in hexadecimal from ASCII. This is 8 bits or 1 byte.

<hr>
 (B) INCORRECT. Decimal is a number system using 10 numbers: 0 through 9. Though you can convert to and from ASCII, decimal is a number system used for counting from 0 to infinity. Making it an infinite number of bits.

<hr>
 (C) INCORRECT. Hexadecimal is a number system using 16 characters: 0 through F. Though you can convert to and from ASCII, hexadecimal is a number system used for counting from 0 to infinity. Making it an infinite number of bits.

<hr>
 (D) INCORRECT. ASCII represents each character in 1 byte.
