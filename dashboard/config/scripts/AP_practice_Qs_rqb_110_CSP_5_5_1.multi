Learning Objective: **5.5.1** and Essential Knowledge statements: **5.5.1E, 5.5.1F**

 (A) Selection is a logic structure in which a question is asked and, depending on the answer, the program takes one of two courses of action, after which the program moves on to the next command.  Option A lists an If Statement which implements selection, not searching. 

<hr>
 (B) Iteration is a process of identifying a block of commands to be repeated until a condition is met.  Each time through the block is called an iteration. The programming construct used to implement iteration is a loop.  Option B lists 3 types of loops which facilitate iteration.

<hr>
 (C) Sequencing is the specific order in which instructions are performed in an algorithm. Option C refers to the order of the lines of code.

<hr>
 (D) Searching is to retrieve information stored in a data structure, most commonly a list (also known as an array). Option D refers to retrieving data from a list.
