## Getting Started > Course Outline

This online PD has 7 stages, which can be broken down into four main sections:

## Section 1: Setting the Stage

We recommend you spend between 10-15 minutes completing Stages 1-4, preferably before you begin teaching any Unit 4 content.

- **Stage 1: Getting Started** - This stage introduces you to the course, its objectives, and how the online PD platform works.
- **Stage 2: Introduction to Unit 4** - This stage allows you to preview the entire scope and sequence for Unit 4. You'll have a chance to prioritize lessons and activities for later exploration.
- **Stage 3: Teaching Strategies** - This stage introduces you to key teaching strategies you might consider implementing in order to help you and your students find success with Unit 4.

## Section 2: Unit 4 Content Review

**Stage 4** provides an opportunity to dive deeply into the content for each sub-unit in Unit 4.  We recommend you spend approximately 5-10 minutes on each stage, and that you try to complete each stage before teaching the associated lessons. So, for example, take 5-10 minutes to complete Stage 4 the week before you plan to teach ECS Unit 4 Days 1-2. Then, deliver the lessons in your class. Return to this online PD to complete Stage 6 before delivering that content. Etc. In this way, you'll work through these stages in real-time, as you teach Unit 4.

## Section 4: Close & Next Steps

The final stage summarizes the online PD and prepares you for the next step in your ECS professional development journey. We recommend you complete this final stage after you have successfully completed all other stages and levels in this online PD. It should take you no longer than 10 minutes.
