#### When to use retrieval and when to use system prompting is a key concept from this unit, and is reinforced in Lesson 18. System prompts can change how a chatbot behaves, but can’t change what it knows about or the content it says; and retrieval can add information to a chatbot and give it additional knowledge to reference, but doesn’t change it’s behavior or tone.

## Up Next!

#### Work through one of three User Stories from Lesson 18, while paying attention to retriveal vs. system prompting.
