The AI and Machine Learning unit is divided into <strong>two chapters</strong>. Each chapter includes activities that provide an opportunity for students to practice new skills. If you are short on time, you may choose to complete only the first chapter of the unit.

## Introduction to App Lab

##### The Ai and Machine Learning unit begins with a lesson on App Lab to get your students familiar with the tool they will use this unit. If your students are already familiar with App Lab, you may decide to skip this lesson. <a href="https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/115001479372-How-can-I-hide-certain-units-or-lessons-from-my-students" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here</a> to learn more about skipping this lesson, allowing your classes to start right away with Chapter 1.


## Chapters

<details style="background-color: #ececec; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; border: 1px solid transparent; border-radius: 5px;">
    <summary style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;">üìò Chapter 1: Understanding Machine Learning</summary>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">
    <p>

##### <strong>Description:</strong> Students learn the basics of machine learning and use a tool called AI Lab to create machine learning models that can be used in App Lab. The unit starts with an overview of machine learning and how computers can use patterns in data to make decisions and predictions. Then, students learn how to use AI Lab to train models from tabular data while exploring issues of bias. Lessons follow a repeating "unplugged - AI Lab - App Lab" pattern so students are continually exposed to the concepts and tools of machine learning. The chapter culminates in a project where students select from a set of real-world datasets to train a machine learning model and create an app.

* ##### How does machine learning find patterns in data to make decisions?
* ##### How can we avoid bias when training a machine learning model?

    <summary style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;">üìó Chapter 2: Design a Machine Learning App</summary>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">
    <p>

##### <strong>Description:</strong> This chapter prepares students to be machine learning scientists to create an app that addresses an issue in their community. Students follow along with a fictional group of students as they define an issue, develop a survey to collect data, analyze their data in AI Lab, create a model card, and create an app to solve their problem. Then, in the final project, students repeat these same steps with an issue they care about in their community.

* ##### How can machine learning be used to solve problems in our community?

## Lessons
##### Most lessons are designed for **45 minute class periods**, but can be modified for longer or shorter class periods. Some lessons, such as project lessons, take multiple days to complete. Suggested times are included in each lesson plan.

### Lesson components

    <summary style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;">üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Warm up</summary>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">
    <p>


##### Each lesson begins with a warm up, which serves as a highly approachable shared experience that highlights the need for the skills and understandings presented in the lesson. These should be kept short so that students can quickly move into the main activity of the lesson. Warm ups end with a big question that articulates the problem space students will be exploring during the lesson. This question sets the stage for the target learning.

<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">
    <p>


##### Students spend the majority of their time engaging in the lesson activity. Activities provide students with opportunities to explore new computing concepts. Exploration is essential for students to build the content knowledge they will need to understand and participate in computing activities. Lesson activities are scaffolded to provide students with just-in-time information to solve their problems as they build their computing knowledge and skills.

<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">
    <p>


##### Wrap ups end every lesson and provide students with opportunities to reflect on the skills and understandings presented in the lesson. Wrap ups include a review of any vocabulary introduced in the lesson, and return to the big question introduced in the warm up. Wrap ups are often journal prompts and short discussions that can be used as an exit ticket or short formative assessment.

    <summary style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;">üíª Programming lessons</summary>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">
    <p>

##### Programming lessons introduce new programming concepts and skills to students. Although students will spend a majority of their time on the computer during these lessons, programming lessons also include offline components. Students are expected to complete many of the activities in small groups or as a class. The teacher plays an active role facilitating opportunities for sense making and formative assessment as students engage in lesson content.

<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">
    <p>


##### Non-programming lessons focus on process skills and non-programming computing concepts. These lessons are mostly offline, but some do include online components. Offline lessons typically include an activity guide that students will use throughout the lesson as a guide for their learning. Non-programming lessons present students with opportunities for collaboration and discussion in small groups as well as individual reflection.

    <p>


##### ***Mini-projects*** are opportunities for students to apply what they have learned by creating something new in a more open-ended setting. Mini-projects appear throughout the unit as opportunities for students to practice open-ended application of a small set of new skills. These projects can be expanded or condensed depending on the class time available. 

##### ***Projects*** are multi-day open-ended lessons found at the end of each chapter or unit. Projects challenge students to create using skills developed throughout the unit. Projects often include opportunities for planning, creation, and reflection.
