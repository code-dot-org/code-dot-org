### Leading a Discussion on Equity in PD >> Expectations

<br/><br/>
Before you start your discussion, it is important to set expectations of what this segment is meant to be, and what it is not.

Here is a list of notes to cover:

<ul>
	<li>
    	I am here as a moderator.
        <ul>
			<li>
            I am not claiming to be an expert.
            </li>
			<li>
            I do not have the answers.
            </li>
			<li>
            I will help keep the discussion civil.
            </li>
			<li>
            I will request that no one dominate the floor.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
     <li>
    	We will not solve all of inequity today.
        <ul>
			<li>
            This discussion is meant to get us to acknowledge our own biases.
            </li>
			<li>
            Feel free to keep discussing privately with colleagues.
            </li>

            Please feel free to recommend helpful tools.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
   
     <li>
    	Be respectful.
        <ul>

            Focus comments on behaviors and beliefs, not people.
            </li>
			<li>
            No personal attacks.
            </li>

            Focus on your own growth, not on others.
            </li>
			<li>
            Disrespectful participants will be asked to step outside.
            </li>
        </ul>
