## Step 4: Know where to find help and support

Check out <a href="https://support.code.org/hc/en-us" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code.org's Support Articles</a> to search responses for common issues and questions. 

In addition, you can also click on the "?" button when it appears on the top right hand side of the page to get help and support, report a problem, or access the <a href="https://forum.code.org/">teacher forum</a>.  The teacher forum is a place for teachers to share best practices, questions, share ideas, and find inspiration.
