**Explanation:** When a network contains redundant connections, the network can continue to function in the event of slow downs or disconnections in specific parts of the network.

Students brainstormed and discussed the benefits of redundancy in networks at the end of [Lesson 4 - Routers and Redundancy](https://studio.code.org/s/csp2-2021/lessons/4). 

::: details [**Essential Knowledge Connected To This Question**]

* CSN-1.E.6: Redundancy within a system often requires additional resources but can provide the benefit of fault-tolerance.

* CSN-1.E.7: The redundancy of routing between two points on the Internet increases the reliability of the Internet and helps it scale to more devices and more people.
