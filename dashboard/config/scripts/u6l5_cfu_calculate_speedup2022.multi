An algorithm was initially written sequentially. Later it was determined that a parallel solution was possible and so the algorithm rewritten. The times to run each version of the algorithm are included in the table below.

|Algorithm Type|Time|
|---|---|
|Sequential|30 mins|
|Parallel|10 mins|

What is the speedup of this parallel solution?
