# Unit 4 Day-by-Day > About This Stage

The levels that follow break the ECS version 5 Unit 4 curriculum down, day-by-day. Each level will summarize and provide an overview of the key lessons in this unit. You'll find links for resources, suggestions for modification, and much more.

Recall that you are not required to work through these levels sequentially. Instead, you should refer to each level before you teach each day's lessons.

When you finish teaching all the lessons in Unit 4, you'll move on to the last two stages where you'll complete the Unit 4 challenge and reflect on this learning experience.
