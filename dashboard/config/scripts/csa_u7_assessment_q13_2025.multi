Consider the following method.

```
public static void strChange(String str) {
  if (str.length() > 0) {
    System.out.print(str.substring(0, 1));
    strChange(str.substring(1));
  }
}
```

Which of the following best describes the behavior of the method?

The `strChange` method is a recursive method that operates on a `String`. Here's how it works:

1. If the length of the `String` is greater than `0`, it prints the first character of the `String` (using `str.substring(0, 1)`) and then calls itself recursively on the rest of the `String` (using `str.substring(1)`).

2. This process continues until the `String` is empty, at which point the recursion stops because the method does nothing when the length of the `String` is not greater than `0`.

The effect of this method is to print the characters of the `String` in the order they appear, starting from the first character and continuing to the last.
