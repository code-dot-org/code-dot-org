# Events > Unplugged Lessons

<br/>

**1. Review "[The Big Event](https://curriculum.code.org/csf-18/coursec/11/)" Lesson Plan from Course C.**
<br/>
Course C is meant for students in Grade 2. Events come up in every CS Fundamentals Course, from A-F. Not every course has an unplugged lesson to cover events, but you can see the unplugged lesson for Course A and Course B at the bottom of this page.
<br/><br/>

**2. Watch the student video: The Big Event**
<br/>
This is a video that you would show your students to help introduce the concept of events and kick off the unplugged lesson.
