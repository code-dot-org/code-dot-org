Events > Reflection

In this stage, you solved some pretty complex puzzles, combining all the core concepts and really demonstrating your learning. By allowing us to trigger actions based on other parts of our program, events allow us to really stretch our coding muscles. **Take a moment now to review how events are introduced in the code.org curriculum.** As you explore the resources below, consider how you might implement the suggested activities in your classroom.

## Unplugged Lesson Plans

**1. Review "The Big Event"Lesson Plan: [Course 1](https://code.org/curriculum/course1/15/Teacher), [Course 2](https://code.org/curriculum/course2/15/Teacher)**
