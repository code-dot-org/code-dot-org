Which algorithms make the MOST sense to write to decompose the problem?

I. `paintDiagonal`

II. `paintFast`

III. `turnAround`
MARKDOWN

All three of these methods would be helpful to decompose the problem. The `paintDiagonal()` method can be used to paint the diagonal lines, and the `paintFast()` method can be used to paint a straight line. The `turnAround()` method can be used to turn the `Painter` object around after painting the top line before painting the diagonal lines.
