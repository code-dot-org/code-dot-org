### Try It!
#### In the class, you have introduced the idea of “patterns” and places and together you talked about how there are four different patterns if you have just two places. Students are about to work in groups to list all possible three place value patterns, but with an added focus on the order of their patterns.
#### These three students have been given one set of manipulatives and are placed in a group to accomplish this task. As you observe the group you overhear the following conversation.

Simone takes out the manipulatives from the bag and starts re-arranging them.

James is writing down something on the paper

Miranda asks "Should we start by adding on to what we did with two patterns?"

James says "The answer is 16."

Miranda says "How did you get that?"

James says "2 times 2 times 2. It is combinatorics - I remember it from stats."
