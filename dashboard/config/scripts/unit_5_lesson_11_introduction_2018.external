# Unit 5: Lesson 11 - *while* Loops

## Background

`if` statements create a "branch" within our program logic, only running some code if a condition is true.  If statements only run once.

We can make our programs *repeatedly* run a set of commands *as long as a condition is true*. This new programming construct is called a `while` loop and is one way we can write programs that repeatedly run a set of commands.

## Vocabulary

**`while` loop:** a programming construct used to repeat a set of commands while a boolean condition is true.

## Lesson

* Exploration of `while` loops in flowcharts
* Use `while` loops in App Lab 

## Resources

* Activity Guide: Flowcharts with *while* Loops ([PDF](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YcOTcwqcBfEt5Cr2pFEM5mbcpJ1F3_vWgl9hb6jO1u4/export?format=pdf) | [DOCX](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YcOTcwqcBfEt5Cr2pFEM5mbcpJ1F3_vWgl9hb6jO1u4/export?format=doc))
