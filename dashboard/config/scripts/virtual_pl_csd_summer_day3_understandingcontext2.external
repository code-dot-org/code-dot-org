#### The fields of software, computing, and computer science are plagued by stark underrepresentation by gender, race, ethnicity, geography, and family income. While 51% of U.S. high schools offer foundational computer science, disparities in access persist. Rural schools, urban schools, and schools with high percentages of economically disadvantaged students are less likely to offer computer science; and Black/African American students, Hispanic/Latino/Latina/Latinx students, and Native American/Alaskan students are less likely to attend a school that offers it.
