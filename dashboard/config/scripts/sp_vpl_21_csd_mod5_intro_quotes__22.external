# Unit Overview

##### In the AI and Machine Learning unit, students learn how computers can find patterns in data to make decisions. They use the Problem Solving Process for machine learning to define a problem, prepare their data, train a model, then test and evaluate their model for accuracy and potential bias. Students explore a variety of scenarios and datasets that lend themselves to machine learning. They also explore some of the modern problems with machine learning, especially around bias and impact.


## Students will:

* ##### Test and evaluate machine learning models for accuracy and potential bias. 
* ##### Learn how machine learning models use data to make decisions.
* ##### Create a machine learning model to solve a problem.
* ##### Create an app that uses their machine learning model.

### **Implementation guidance** 

* ##### Complete the first three lessons of the Problem Solving and Computing unit of CS Discoveries before starting.

* ##### This unit assumes students are familiar with App Lab, specifically using Design Mode to create a user interface and using Events to change the screen when clicking a button. This can be accomplished by having students complete the <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/applab-intro/lessons/1/levels/1" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">App Lab Hour of Code</a> before starting this unit.

* ##### Guidance for how to support students in programming levels and differentiate tasks are available in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WGywQ25khB6-FB20x6wO9dGVO9_qJlWkuLVLREJS4Jo/preview" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Programming Levels Guide</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15Y6Mo3fMUtHq16SSskABgcYE-5xfk-Ewv0z_o4uaLdI/preview" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Differentiation Guide</a>.

### **Suggested time to complete the unit:** 5 weeks 
##### The suggested time is based on 225 instructional minutes per week. Visit the <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/csd7-2022" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unit Overview Page</a> and use the unit calendar to adjust the instructional minutes to reflect the time you have with your students each week.
