# Teaching Strategies > ECS Teaching Approaches

ECS uses a different approach to teaching than the traditional lecture based class. It is focused on the teacher being more of a facilitator or coach than an expert, using guiding questions, such as: 

- What do you think will happen next, have you tried?
- What else might you do?
- Have you asked any other students what they think a good solution might be?
