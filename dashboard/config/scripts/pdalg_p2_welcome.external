## Phase 2 Blended Summer Study - Online

Welcome to the online portion of your Blended Summer Study! In this course you'll have the opportunity to reflect on and refine the teaching techniques you developed during your in-person workshop and spend more time with the curriculum to prepare for teaching the course in the fall. These online activities should take no more than 2 hours, and we recommend spreading that time out between now and the start of the school year. 

You'll want to keep your [CS in Algebra Teacher Manual](https://code.org/curriculum/docs/algebra/CSinACourseA.pdf) handy as a reference. Because these activities are all targeted at helping you prep to teach the first unit of the course, you might consider jotting down notes and suggestions from the forums in your teacher manual or somewhere you can easily access when it comes time to teach the course!
