# Lessons 4-7 > Starting the Big Game

Your students' first encounter with the Big Game is the best time to start learning the software development practices that will help them succeed throughout the entirety of the project. While we've made a significant effort to create an environment that will support students even when they make mistakes, a few simple habits will help ensure students remain successful and productive even when things go wrong.

## Version Control

Professional software developers rely on version control tools to ensure that they never lose a good working copy when adding new features. As students iterate on their game, it's important to consider how the versions are being saved to allow them to undo anything that might break.

Each time you complete a level of the Big Game, a version will be recorded in your version history, allowing you to easily roll back to a previous version if you ever get stuck with an error you can't resolve. Because you get a new version for each puzzle that you complete, it's important to encourage students to do their work a bit at a time (as we suggest in the level instructions) instead of trying to complete a lot of work all at once. Doing a whole bunch of work in one go means that a whole chunk of progress will be lost if you need to roll back to a previous version.

## Remix

Version control is a great way to undo little changes you make along the way, but sometimes you want to dive in to bigger changes. In every Big Game level you'll see a Remix button next to the Code Studio logo. Clicking Remix spins off a new copy of your game that you can edit and play with without the risk of breaking your working copy.

Each time you click Remix you'll get a new copy of your game in your projects folder <a href="studio.code.org/projects" target="_blank">studio.code.org/projects</a>, each of which can be iterated on independently of the Big Game levels. This is a great way for students to experiment with adding big new features to their game safely before integrating those features into their actual Big Game.
