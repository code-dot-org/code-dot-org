<hr>
 (A) For each one bit that we include, we can represent twice as many integer values. With 16 bits, we cause the number of values to double 8 times over again, causing drastically more possibilities than intended. 

<hr>
 (B) For each one bit that we include, we can represent twice as many integer values. With 10 bits, we cause the number of values to double 2 times over again, causing more possibilities than intended. 

<hr>
 (C) For each bit that we include, we can represent twice as many integer values. With 9 bits, we cause the number of values to double just once, allowing us to represent 512 integer values. 

<hr>
 (D) For each bit that we include, we can represent twice as many integer values. With 12 bits, we cause the number of values to double 4 times over again, causing many more possibilities than intended.
