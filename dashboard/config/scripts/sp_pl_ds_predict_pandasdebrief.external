## Prediction Discussion


#### While you may not fully understand the code yet, the lists of data separated by commas stands out.

#### You may have **noticed:** 

- ####  code imports pandas and reads *USGasPrices.csv* into *gas_data*.
- ####  **'print(gas_data.shape)'** outputs the number of rows and columns.

#### You might **wonder** why pandas is shortened to pd and what other functions it offers.


#### Remember, at this stage, the aim isn't for students to master these concepts yet, but rather to encourage them to analyze and discuss the code.
