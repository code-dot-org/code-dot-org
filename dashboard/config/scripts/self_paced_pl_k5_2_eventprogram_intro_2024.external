#### We will begin our journey in Sprite Lab. **Sprite Lab** is a block-based programming environment that allows students to create simple animations and games with objects and characters.



#### Sprite Lab uses  a type of coding called **event-based programming**. Instead of just following a strict sequence of instructions, the flow of an **event-based program** is determined by events such as user actions, like clicking a button. 



#### *This approach is commonly found in interactive applications like video games.* 


#### **In this module, you will learn how to build an interactive program while learning basic computer science concepts.**



## But first, letâ€™s introduce you to Sprite Lab.
