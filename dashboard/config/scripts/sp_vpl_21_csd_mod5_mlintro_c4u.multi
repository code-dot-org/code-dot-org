##### Student A and Student B are discussing their results after training A.I. Bot to recognize fish. They notice that one A.I. Bot incorrectly identified six pieces of trash as fish and the other A.I. Bot did not identify any trash as fish. 

##### You ask, "**What is a possible explanation for why one A.I. Bot was more accurate than the other in telling the difference between trash and fish?"**

MARKDOWN

**Explanation:** A.I. Bot learns better when it has more examples. The best way we can improve its ability to recognize fish is by giving it more examples to look at. Students may also make the connection that this is how humans learn, especially young children - the more examples we have, the better we learn.
