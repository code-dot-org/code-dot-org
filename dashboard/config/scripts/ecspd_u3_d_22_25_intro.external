#### Key Concepts

1. Students will use what they have learned throughout this unit to create a website and be able to explain what elements they included in their website and why.

#### Common Difficulties

This lesson like Day 17-19 where they were to create a website about their future, may be one in which you will need to encourage students to make a decision about what topic they want to choose from (an ethical dilemma, a career, a worldwide or community problem or topic of their choice that you approve).

They may also want to add elements that you don't know how to do, so you will want to think back to some of the strategies discussed earlier that refer them to asking 3 other students before asking you, challenge them to find out and tell you the next day, etc.
