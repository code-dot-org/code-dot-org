markdown <<MARKDOWN
You are trying to write a function _swap(list, a, b)_ , which will swap the position of the two values at indexes _a_ and _b_ in the _list_.  

Example: before and after a call to _swap(list, 1, 2)_ on the list shown below

The function header is defined for you.  Choose the 3 lines of code that will perform the swap correctly.

    function swap(list, a, b){
        <choose option from below> 
    }

It is important to note that swapping a to b, and then b to a will **not** work. For example:

	*THIS EXAMPLE DOES NOT WORK*
    a = 30
    b = 75
    Swapping a to b, a = 75, b = 75
    Swapping b to a, a = 75, b = 75
    
In this case, you would need to temporarily store the data of one of the variables to successfully swap the numbers. To do this, create a temp variable that holds the data at index _b_. Swap the data at _b_ with _a_, and then set the data at _a_ to temp which holds the original value of index _b_.
