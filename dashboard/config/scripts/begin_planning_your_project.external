# The Design Process

The design process is a list of steps students will follow to work on their final projects. Sometimes developing a solution involves designing a product, such as a machine or game, that will meet a certain criteria for accomplishing a task. It’s important to think of the design process as a “wheel” with no set beginning or end, and as an ongoing process. In this lesson students will navigate through the steps of the design process to build their interactive games.
