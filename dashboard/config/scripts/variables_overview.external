# Variables Overview and How To Guide

In JavaScript (and most programming languages) the most primitive type of memory you can use is called a variable. It's called a variable because it's a piece of memory in which you can change what's stored - its value can vary. Being able to control memory in a program is important because it lets the programmer keep track of things throughout a program. Common use cases for variables are keeping track of a high score or the number of lives left in a game, but the applications of variables are much, much, broader than just tracking things in games. There are three things students need to know how to do with variables:
To create a chunk of memory to use in a program you use the `var` command.
To assign a value to a variable means to store a value in memory; you use the `=`operator.
Variable re-assignment typically means to change the value of a variable based on its current value.
