# Misconceptions: Make a Prediction

At this point you know how to create variables with `var`, update its value with `=`, and display its value using `write` and `console.log`. To get more comfortable with using these tools together let's look at 4 programs that **highlight common misconceptions about variables**.

**For each program below, predict what values will be displayed in the Debug Console. Be prepared to share your answers**

**Program 1:**
	var age;
	console.log(age);

**Program 2:**
```
var items = 20;
items = 10;
console.log(items);
```

**Program 3:**
```
var items = 20;
console.log(items);
items = 10;
console.log(items);
```

**Program 4:**
```
var score = randomNumber(10,20);
console.log(score);
console.log(score);
```

**Once you've shared your predictions, move on to the next level to try out the code for yourself.**
