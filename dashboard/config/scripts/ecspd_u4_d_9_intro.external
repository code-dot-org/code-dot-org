## Key Concepts

- Students will be introduced to a broadcasting event by role playing.   One sprite will broadcast an event and another sprite will receive the event and perform a script.
- They will use the switch to costume" block, "say" block, "broadcast" block, "when I receive" block, "show" block, "hide" block, and "switch background" block.
- Students will need to finish the [Summer Story Project](http://code.org/ecs#page=156) using the new blocks.

## Common Difficulties

This lesson presents some blocks that can be hard to use, "switch to costume" block, "broadcast" block, "when I receive" block, "show" block, "hide" block, "switch background" block.
<br><br>
This lesson has multiple things happening on and off the screen at the same time.  You will need to keep track of 1 main sprite, three additional sprites showing or hiding, three backgrounds to be switched out with the particular character and conversation.
