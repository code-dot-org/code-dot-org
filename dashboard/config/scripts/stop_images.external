# Images Review

The `<img>` tag allows you to show images on your web page.

Example:

`<img src="dog.png" alt="dog jumping"/>`

In order to tell the browser which file to use, extra information, called an attribute, is added to the `<img>` tag inside the brackets. The attribute src stands for source and tell the name of the image. Image files names include extensions which tell the computer which type of image they are working with. Common extensions are .jpg, .jpeg, .png.

In addition to have the src attribute, image elements also have the alt attribute which describe the image. This is important in case the image doesnâ€™t load or for people who have trouble with their eyesight.

An `<img>` tag is an example of a void element because it starts and closes in one tag. To mark this we put the / which usually goes in the close tag at the end of the image tag.

## Review: Image Attributes

**Transition:** Have students transition off the computer.

**Group:** Partner up.

**Prompt:** 
You are going to turn and talk about the difference between the two attributes, src and alt.

1. Get together with your partner and decide who is taller.  
2. The taller person will go first and explain the element information that src contains. 
3. The shorter person will go second and explain the extra information that alt contains.

## Web Lab: About Me Page

**Transition:** Have students return to Code Studio Bubble 6 Lesson 6.

**Circulate:** Students should be picking 3 images and formulating an About Me page. Students may want to find their own images but encourage them for now to stick to the ones included in the page. Keep an eye for students who might be sharing too much personal information.
