## Lesson plans

Within the lesson plan, you will find a teaching guide, lesson objectives, links to student and teacher lesson resources, standards alignment, and all other content necessary for teaching the lesson. You can also preview student facing levels from within the lesson plan. To navigate between lessons, you can click the purple "Other Lessons in this Unit" button and choose a different lesson plan to view.
