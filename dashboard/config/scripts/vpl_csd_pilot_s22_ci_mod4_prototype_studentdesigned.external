# Student designed paper prototypes

##### Early in the Design Process unit, students engage with a paper prototype that was designed for them, they will later move on to creating paper prototypes of their on. They will first do this as a part of the Chapter 1 project, and again in Chapter 2 as they prepare to make their digital prototypes. 

##### **Prototype** - A first or early model of a product that allows you to test assumptions before developing a final version.

### Why is it a good idea to build a prototype before jumping straight into making the final app?

* ##### It's easier and faster to sketch out an idea.
* ##### Testing ideas on paper lets you find problems in your assumptions before you spend time programming.
* ##### Users are more likely to give feedback on something that looks less polished / finished.

##### As students build out their own paper prototypes, encourage connections to the definition of prototype, especially “first or early model” and “test assumptions before developing a final version”. 

## Screen planning

##### Students will start by planning the screens they will need to develop for their app. For each screen, tthey will decide on a title and write a brief description of what the screen will include.

## Navigation planning

##### Students will then draw sketches of their screens and add arrows showing how a user would navigate between your screens.
