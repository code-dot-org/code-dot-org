# Maker App + Circuit Playground

##### The Maker App  is an environment that allows you to communicate with a Circuit Playground using a set of additional commands available in App Lab. Using the same drag-and-drop editor that students have become comfortable with in App Lab and Game Lab, students can turn on LEDs, read sensors, and write programs that use physical hardware for user input and output.

## What is the Circuit Playground?

##### The Circuit Playground is a small microcontroller board with LEDs, buttons, and sensors built in. Based on the popular Arduino platform, the Circuit Playground enables students to get up and running quickly with physical computing without many of the traditional barriers to entry. 

## What is the Maker Toolkit?

##### Maker Toolkit is an add-on on top of App Lab, our block-to-text app development environment. Maker Toolkit provides of a special set of commands that allow student apps to communicate with external hardware. Maker Toolkit is currently optimized to work with the Adafruit Circuit Playground. The CS Discoveries Physical Computing Unit involves the use of this Circuit Playground board, and the standalone Maker App.

## Do I need a class set of Circuit Playgrounds to teach CS Discoveries?

##### You will need a class set of Circuit Playgrounds to teach the Physical Computing unit. If you do not have access to Circuit Playgrounds, you will be able to teach all units of CS Discoveries except the Physical Computing unit.
