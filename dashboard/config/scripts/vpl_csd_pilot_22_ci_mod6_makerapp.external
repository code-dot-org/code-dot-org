# Maker App + Circuit Playground

##### The Maker App is an environment that allows you to communicate with a Circuit Playground using a set of additional commands available in App Lab. Using a drag-and-drop editor, students can turn on LEDs, read sensors, and write programs that use physical hardware for user input and output.

## What is the Circuit Playground?

##### The Circuit Playground is a small microcontroller board with LEDs, buttons, and sensors built in. Based on the popular Arduino platform, the Circuit Playground enables students to get up and running quickly with physical computing without many of the traditional barriers to entry. 

## Do I need a class set of Circuit Playgrounds to teach CS Discoveries?

##### You will need a class set of Circuit Playgrounds to teach the Physical Computing unit. If you do not have access to Circuit Playgrounds, you will be able to teach all units of CS Discoveries except the Physical Computing unit.
