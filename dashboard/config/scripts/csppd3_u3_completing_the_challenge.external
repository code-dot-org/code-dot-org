### Get into the Lesson

- **Read through** the entire lesson plan.
- **Do the levels in Code Studio for the lesson**.

## 2. Create:

### While you're doing the lesson...

- **Save the programming artifact** you create while doing the levels (the specific level you should save is shown on the next page).
- **Jot down your thoughts** about:
    - ahha! moments during the activities
    - what was difficult about these activities?
    - what did you enjoy about this lesson?
    - what additional resources might be useful for teaching this lesson?

### Extend the Lesson

- **Create your own** Extension Activity or Assessment Question that could be used with this lesson.
 - Remember, an **Extension Activity** is an exercise or project that could be added to the lesson plan and completed by students to build on what they learned. An **Assessment Question** could be a formative or summative assessment item that is used to check student understanding of the concept(s) covered in the lesson.
- Develop a **write-up** explaining to another teacher how to use your Extension or Assessment item.
