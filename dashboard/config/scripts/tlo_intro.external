Code.org believes that Teacher/Learner/Observer (TLO) activities are a vital part of the professional development experience.  

Learning curriculum is one thing, learning to teach curriculum requires more.  That's why we like to give our teachers opportunities to practice teaching as they're experiencing the lessons themselves.

A TLO is designed to encourage a teacher to practice preparing a lesson in earnest. We then ask them to teach that lesson to their peers, while the peers experience the lesson from the standpoint of a student audience.

The final step is for the facilitator of the PD to bring the small groups back together and discuss the details of the lesson and potential pitfalls that teachers and students might experience.

## Quick Guide to TLO

1. Break up into small groups, ideally between 2 & 4 people.
2. Use the curriculum to authentically prepare a lesson (or version of a lesson) to teach to your peers.
3. Come together with another group (ideally one that is teaching a different lesson) and acknowledge the different roles that you have to play. (We suggest putting on your **Teacher** and **Learner** "hats".)
4. Present your lesson to the **Learners** as if you were teaching to your own classroom.
5. When you're finished, the PD facilitator will chime in to guide the entire class in a discussion about the lesson.
6. Once the lesson review is complete, it's time for the **Teachers** to become the **Learners** and the **Learners** to become **Teachers**.
