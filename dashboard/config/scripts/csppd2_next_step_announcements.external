# Wrap Up > What's next?

Professional development will start back up in the early fall. Over the school year we'll have 4 in-person sessions on weekends along with ongoing online PD, which will be mapped to particular lessons in units 2-5. 

You can always find out more about PD dates by checking the PD website for your region. Visit and bookmark the page for your region to keep up to date on logistics for your in-person PD. Please add all applicable dates to your personal calendar.
