Consider the following incorrect program, which is intended to move the robot around the perimeter of a grid, as indicated by the drawing below.  The starting position and direction of the robot is indicated in the diagram.

	Line 1: REPEAT 4 TIMES
    Line 2: {
    Line 3:      MOVE_FORWARD()
    Line 4:      ROTATE_RIGHT()
    Line 5:      MOVE_FORWARD()
    Line 6:      MOVE_FORWARD()
    Line 7:      MOVE_FORWARD()
    Line 8:      MOVE_FORWARD()
    Line 9:      ROTATE_RIGHT()
    Line 10: }

There are two possible approaches to this question:

* Go through the code line by line and see which ones need to be removed or
* Write the code from scratch according to the given figure and see what is different in comparison to the given code

First, look at the figure and break down the steps the robot needs to take. Looking at the figure, the robot needs to move forward 4 steps then rotate right. Notice the robot is moving clockwise and thus, will need to rotate right rather than left. This is repeated 4 times to make a square. Looking at the given code, lines 3 and 4 are extra steps and need to be removed.
