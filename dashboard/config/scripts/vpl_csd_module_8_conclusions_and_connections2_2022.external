#Conclusions and Connections 
**Estimated time: 20 - 25 minutes**

The calendar below provides a look at the lesson progressions for Physical Computing.  Notice you have investigated Lessons 1 through 7 between Module 7 and this module.  The unit's concepts build towards cumulative projects at the end of each chapter.

Chapter 1 focuses on programming with hardware and by the end of Chapter 1, students should be able to build a game within Code Studio that uses the inputs and outputs of the Circuit Playground. We will explore Chapter 2 in the Module 8 synchronous workshop. 

The following levels focus on the end of chapter project for Chapter 1 with Lesson 9 - Project: Make a Game to identify what students are working towards and what will be assessed and how.
