lesson_group 'csd1_1', display_name: 'Chapter 1: The Problem Solving Process'
lesson_group_description 'This chapter guides students to develop and adopt a more formal structured problem solving process by reflecting on problems they have problems they have encountered, both in the classroom and everyday life. By working through a diverse set of problems, such as logic puzzles, engineering challenges, and planning a trip, students learn to identify different classes of problems, decompose large problems, and develop their personal problem solving skills.'

lesson_group_description 'This chapter presents computers as machines that solve information problems. Students begin by building a common definition for a computer that focuses on functionality instead of specific hardware. They then explore the ways that computers approach problems. For their final project, students propose an app that could be used to solve a problem of their choosing.'
