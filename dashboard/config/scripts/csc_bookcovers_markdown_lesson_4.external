**Now that you have coded your book cover, it's time to share it out!**

As you view your classmates' projects consider the following questions:

>1. What sprites and dialogue did you see in your classmatesâ€™ book covers?
>2. What is being portrayed in this scene?
>3. How were their choices similar to yours? How were they different?
>4. Would you want to read the book based on its cover?
