# Check for Understanding

## Answer: C

#### While there might not be a single "correct" answer, as teaching strategies can vary based on context and educational goals, personalized learning platforms can be seen as the best way to implement AI aligned with UDL and CRT principles in Mrs. Thompson's classroom.

#### Personalized learning platforms can address the wide range of learning styles, abilities, and cultural backgrounds in her class by offering tailored learning experiences.This approach ensures that each student has access to content that is not only at the right difficulty level but also reflects and respects their cultural heritage. It embodies the principles of UDL by providing multiple means of engagement, representation, and action/expression, and it aligns with CRT by incorporating content that is culturally relevant to all students. While the other options have their benefits, they do not fully embrace the comprehensive approach of UDL and CRT like a personalized learning platform does.
