# Welcome to Code.org's CS Principles post-course survey!



This questionnaire will be used to help Code.org understand and improve its work in schools across the country, and to make the CS Principles course better. 

Please note this is NOT a student evaluation, nor is it an evaluation of your school or your teacher.

**Your honesty and privacy are important to us**: 

(1) Your personal responses on this survey are *anonymous* and will never be revealed publicly.

(2) Your responses will *never* be tied back to you personally.

(3) Your teacher can see results for the whole class, but *without names* associated with responses.

(4) Please answer honestly and thoughtfully. Code.org takes your responses seriously.

## First, we have some questions for you about your schoolwork in general.

**How much do you agree or disagree with the following statements?**
