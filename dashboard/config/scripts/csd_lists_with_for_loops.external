# Lists with For Loops

## Print an Array with a *for* Loop

As you know, we can use variables as indexes in an array.  We can take advantage of this fact to create a `for` **loop which visits every index in an array**.

In this `for` loop, the `i` eventually gets set to every possible index in the array. You are going to use a loop of this kind to display all the values in an array.
