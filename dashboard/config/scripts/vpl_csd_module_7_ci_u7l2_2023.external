# AI and Machine Learning - Lesson 2: Introduction to Machine Learning

> ##### <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/csd7-2023/lessons/2" target="blank">U7L2 Lesson Plan: Introduction to Machine Learning</a>


> ##### **Note:** We completed Lesson 2: Introduction to Machine Learning over the Summer. Weâ€™ll do a quick review here as a reminder before we dive into the remainder of the unit.

## Lesson Overview
##### In this lesson students are introduced to a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning and how they can use the Problem Solving Process to help train a robot to solve problems. They participate in three machine learning activities where a robot - A.I. Bot - is learning how to detect patterns in fish.

## Lesson Objectives
* ##### Apply the Problem Solving Process to train a computer to solve a problem.

## Investigation Tasks

* ##### Review the lesson plan to refresh your memory of what you did over the Summer
