The most important idea in this problem is that when a number is added to a string, the number is treated like a string.

Going through the code line by line:

* A variable num holds the integer 5
* A variable str holds the string "hello"
* Evaluating the right side first, num + str combines the two together to get "5hello"
* Variable result is set to "5hello"
* The result is then printed out, and since result holds "5hello", "5hello" is the output for this code
