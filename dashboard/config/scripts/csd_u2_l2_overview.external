# Overview

This lesson introduces websites as a means of personal expression.  The class first discusses different ways that people express and share their interests and ideas, then looks at a few exemplar websites made by students from a previous course. Finally everyone brainstorms and shares a list of topics and interests to include, creating a resource for developing a personal website in the rest of the unit.
