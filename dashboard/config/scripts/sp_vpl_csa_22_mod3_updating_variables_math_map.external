# Updating variables

In addition to declaring and initializing variables, we also want to update the value stored in a variable.  To update the values stored in a variable, we use the name of the variable, the assignment operator (=), and the new value we want to store in the variable.

```Example
1. // declare and initialize a String bestDate
2. String bestDate = “April 25th”
3. 
4. // update the variable bestDate
5. bestDate = “May 4th”
```

We would read line 5 as “bestDate gets May 4th”.  `“May 4th”` is now stored in `bestDate` and the old value is essentially "forgotten" by the computer.

## Using mathematical operators
We can also use **mathematical operators** to update `ints` and `doubles` stored inside variables.  The mathematical operators Java uses are in the table below:

| Operation      | Java Operator | Example  |
| :---        		|    :----:   | :--- |
| Addition      	| `+` | `int songsPlayed = 4 + 1;` |
| Subtraction   	| `-` | `double cost = 2.99 - .50;` |
| Multiplication   	|`*`  | `int mealsOrdered = 4 * 7;`  |
| Division   		| `/` | `double slicesPerPerson = 15 / 6;` |
| Modulo  			| `%` | `int value = 7 % 3;`  |

## Example
Let's look at an example:

```
1. // declare and initialize an int of numberOfPets
2. int numberOfPets = 3;
3. 
4. // increase the value stored in numberOfPets by 2
5. numberOfPets = numberOfPets + 2;
```

**Explanation:** In the example above, `numberOfPets` holds the value `3` when it is initialized.  On line, 5 we get the value of `numberOfPets` and add `2` to the value stored in `numberOfPets`.  We then store the new value of `5` now in `numberOfPets`.
