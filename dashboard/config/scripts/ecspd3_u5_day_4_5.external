# Unit 5 Lessons > Days 4 - 5

## Concepts Covered

Research questions, validating claims with research data.

## Lesson Overview

This lesson finishes off the room data collection project with a debrieft. Afterwards students have time to **explore the sample data sets** provided in a data analysis analysis tool and research questions around either the sample final projects or one of their choosing. Students should be able to **identify research questions** that can be answered to validate the message/story they want to tell with appropriate research data.
<br><br>
Students will need to keep in mind the complexities of creating appropriate survey questions, collecting the data sets, processing data sets using a data analysis tool, and be able to report their findings using a website or scratch project.

> ## Hints from an ECS Teacher:
> - As you examine data sets for the final project topics and answer the “Data Analysis questions” listed with each topic, you may want to remember that in Excel you can use a pivot table to summarize counts of each category. A pivot table is a useful tool for discovering trends and patterns in the data.
