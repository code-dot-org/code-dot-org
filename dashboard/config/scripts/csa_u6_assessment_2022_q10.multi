Consider the following method.

```
public int addTen(int n) {
   return n + 10;
}
```

The following code segment appears in a method in the same class as `addTen` method.

```
Integer aNumber = 25;
int newNumber = addTen(aNumber);
Integer result = newNumber;
System.out.print(result);
```

What, if anything, is printed as a result of executing the code segment?
