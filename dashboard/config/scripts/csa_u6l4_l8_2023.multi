Option A is not correct because `length` is not a method of the `ArrayList` class.

Option B is not correct because there is no `total()` method in the `ArrayList` class.

Option C is **correct** because `size()` is the method in the `ArrayList` class that returns the number of elements in the list.

Option D is not correct because `size()` is a method of the `ArrayList` class, and must be called on an instance of the ArrayList class.

Option E is not correct because `length` is not a method of the `ArrayList` class. It is a property of arrays in Java.
