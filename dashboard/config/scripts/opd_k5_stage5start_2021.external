So far, you've written a simple program and added loops to increase efficiency. In this stage, we'll explore **if-statements** which begin to add logic to your program.

By completing Stage 6, you will:

- Practice coding simple conditionals
- Reflect on classroom application

>**What to Expect in this Stage:** We'll first introduce an unplugged lesson from Course D (meant for Grade 3) that introduces the idea of conditionals. Then, you will complete a series of puzzles will ask you to apply your learning using conditionals. We'll close with an opportunity to reflect. You should spend between 20-45 minutes on this stage.

Ready? Let's go!
