**Explanation:** This is an example of sequencing because the steps of getting ready in the morning are being put in order.

[Lesson 1 - Algorithms Solve Problems](https://studio.code.org/s/csp6-2022/lessons/1) defined the terms sequencing, selection, and iteration.

::: details [**Essential Knowledge Connected To This Question**]

* AAP-2.A.4: Every algorithm can be constructed using combinations of sequencing, selection, and iteration.
* AAP-2.B.1: Sequencing is the application of each step of an algorithm in the order in which the code statements are given.
* AAP-2.G.1: Selection determines which parts of an algorithm are executed based on a condition being true or false.
* AAP-2.J.1: Iteration is a repeating portion of an algorithm. Iteration repeats a specified number of times or until a given condition is met.
