The method `countEvens` below is intended to return the number of times an even number appears in the array `myArray`. The method may not work as intended.

```
public int countEvens(int[] myArray) {
  int count = 0;
  for( int j = 0; j < myArray.length; j++) {   // Line 4
    if (myArray[j] % 2 == 0) {
      count++;
    }
  }

  return count;
}
```

Which of the following changes, if any, can be made to Line 4 so that the method will work as intended?
