Now it's time to make your observations!
Make sure you have a copy of the Model Observation Form ready to go and open the SL Nova Mystery Model <a href="http://www.slnova.org/GUTS/projects/36743/"> HERE</a>.  

Fill out your Model Observation form as you experiment with the model, and remember--try not to peek at the code...yet!
