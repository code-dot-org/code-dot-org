# Balancing Teacher and Tools in Unit 4

All of the lessons in unit 4 require the use of a computer in order to do the core activities. The snapshot on the right indicates lessons that use external tools and websites with a solid red rectangle, and lessons that use widgets in Code Studio with a dashed red rectangle. 

As previously discussed, there are two aspects to keep in mind on the topic of balancing the teacher and the tools - giving students space to discover through the activities and the tools while also managing the realities of a classroom that is using computers heavily.

## External Tools
The external tools used in unit 4 are primarily websites that help students better understand how data is collected and used. There's a mix of curated websites along with opportunities for students to find and highlight their own. In addition to these information-disseminating websites, students will use the following interactive external sites: 

- Lesson 3: [Visualization tool that shows data breaches](http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/)  
- Lesson 6: [Password Strength Checker](http://howsecureismypassword.net) 
- Lesson 7: [Interactive Clock](http://www.visnos.com/demos/clock)

## Cipher and Encrption Widgets

Lessons 5 - 7 leverage educational widgets that we've build into Code Studio. These widgets give students the opportunity to experiment with cracking Caesar and Random Substitution Ciphers, as well as work with a Vigenere Cipher and go through a demonstration of public key cryptography. These lessons are designed to be particularly exploratory in nature.
