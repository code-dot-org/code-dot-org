In a computer science classroom, students are expected to solve problems that don't have clear answers, work together with their peers, and play an active role in their learning. For some students, this might be a new way of learning. The culture that is created within the classroom from the start is crucial in helping students feel like they belong in CS and in setting students up for success.
