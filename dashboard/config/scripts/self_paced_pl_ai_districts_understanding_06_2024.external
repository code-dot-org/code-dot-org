# Practice

#### Let’s try it out! You may have used a Large Language Model like ChatGPT before. If so, try to choose something new or try a different prompt.

#### We’ll dive into how to use these tools as an educator in a later module. For now, your primary goal should be getting an account made and getting familiar with at least one of these tools.


## **To Do:** 
* #### Go to <a href="https://chat.openai.com/" target="_blank">https://chat.openai.com/</a>.
* #### Sign-up to make a free account.
* #### Feel free to explore as you wish, but we recommend you take this time to use it to learn a bit more about what AI is and how it works.

    <summary style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;">But my school/district uses another LLM...</summary>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; padding-bottom:20px;">
    <p>

#### Not a problem! The prompting practice that you develop in these activities will help you develop skills that are transferable to any LLM. Or, feel free to do these activities using the LLM your district uses, just know that not all LLMs have the same functionality so you may not be able to complete the activity as written.
