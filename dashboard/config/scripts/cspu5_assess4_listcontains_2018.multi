    i = 1
    val = 0
    n = LENGTH(data)
    REPEAT n TIMES
    {	
        val = val + data[i]
        data[i] = val
        i = i + 1

Going through the code line by line as it repeats while keeping track of data[]:

* Currently, data = [2,3,1,2]
* i is set to 1, val is set to 0, and n is set to the length of data which n = 4
* The loop repeats 4 times. Every time it loops: val equals the current val plus the data at index i, the data at index i is set to val, and i is incremented by one.
* First repetition: current val = 0, i = 1, data[i] = 2. val = 0 + 2 = 2. data[1] = 2
* Current data = = [2,3,1,2]
* Second repetition: current val = 2, i = 2, data[i] = 3. val = 2 + 3 = 5. data[2] = 5
* Current data = = [2,5,1,2]
* Third repetition: current val = 5, i = 3, data[i] = 1. val = 5 + 1 = 6. data[3] = 6
* Current data = = [2,5,6,2]
* Fourth repetition: current val = 6, i = 4, data[i] = 2. val = 6 + 2 = 8
* Final data = = [2,5,6,8]

**In summary:** This code adds the current index value to the previous index value, resulting in the accumulative sum of the data.
