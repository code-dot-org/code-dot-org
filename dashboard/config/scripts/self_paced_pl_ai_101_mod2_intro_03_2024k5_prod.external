# The AI Landscape

#### What about all the other things we’ve heard about - machine learning, natural language processing, how do all of these fit together?

#### Take a look at the diagram below to get a better idea. Key terms are defined underneath.

>* #### **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** AI is the branch of computer science that aims to develop systems capable of performing tasks that would normally require human intelligence, including decision-making, visual perception, and speech recognition.
>* #### **Machine Learning (ML):** ML is a subset of AI that involves training algorithms to learn patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention, based on data.
>* #### **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** NLP is a field at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics, focused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
>* #### **Deep Learning:** Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks) to analyze large volumes of data, enabling the model to learn complex patterns.
>* #### **Large Language Models:** These are advanced deep learning models trained on extensive corpora of text data, capable of understanding and generating human-like text by predicting subsequent parts of text based on the input they receive.
>* #### **ChatGPT:** ChatGPT is a prominent example of a large language model, developed by OpenAI, designed specifically for generating human-like responses in a conversational context by processing and producing text based on its training on a diverse dataset.

#### Everything in this diagram falls under the larger umbrella of Data Science, so let’s define that term too.

>* #### **Data Science:** an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data.

    <summary style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;">Wait...what...?</summary>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; padding-bottom:20px;">
    <p>

#### It’s okay if you didn’t catch all of that! Here are the same terms defined using non-technical language.

>* #### **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Teaching computers to think and make decisions like humans do.
>* #### **Machine Learning (ML):** A way for computers to learn from experience without being directly programmed every step. For example, this is how Netflix recommendation algorithms work.
>* #### **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Helps computers understand and respond to human language, like reading or listening. This is how Siri understands your questions.
>* #### **Deep Learning:** A method for computers to learn and make decisions by simulating the network of neurons in a human brain. Used in facial recognition technology such as unlocking smartphones.
>* #### **Large Language Models:** Huge computer programs that are really good at understanding and generating human-like text based on what they've learned from a vast amount of written material. The technology behind ChatGPT.
>* #### **ChatGPT:** A smart chat program that can write and chat about almost anything by using what it's learned from a lot of books, websites, and other texts.
>* #### **Data Science:** The process of finding patterns and answers in a lot of information to help solve problems or make decisions. An example would be how Fitbit and other health trackers analyze sleep patterns.
