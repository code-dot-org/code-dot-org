Why are parameters useful when programming?

Incorrect answers:

* Parameters can change the behavior inside a function, but the function only runs the number of times it is called and is not always based on the parameters given.
* Parameters can help define boundaries within the function, but is not restricted to teams of programmers. An individual programmer can used parameters as well.
* Once code is written, it is read line by line in order. The input of a parameter will not change the order the lines run in.

Correct answer:

* Ultimately, parameters are great for noting specific inputs for a particular function, allowing flexible outcomes within a function.
* For example: say you want a function to draw some squares but with different side lengths. The function drawSquare(s) where s is the side length. The programmer can then easily call

		drawSquare(3);
		drawSquare(8);
        drawSquare(76);
        
For squares of side length 3, 8, and 76 without having repetitive chunks of code in their program.
