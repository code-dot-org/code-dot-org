## Pre-requisites

No previous experience with coding or computer science education is assumed. This is a beginner's course.

> **A Note About Audience:** This course focuses on Code.orgâ€™s free Computer Science Fundamentals curriculum in the context of  K-5 learners. Although many of the same concepts can be applied to any computer science course, if you wish to teach a more in-depth computer science curriculum than Computer Science Fundamentals (for example, one of our [Middle](https://code.org/educate/csd) or [High school](https://code.org/educate/csp) courses), we recommend you pursue more [in-depth or ongoing professional development opportunities](https://code.org/educate/professional-learning/middle-high).

## Course Duration
