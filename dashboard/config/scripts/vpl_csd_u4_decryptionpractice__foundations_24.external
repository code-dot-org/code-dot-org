# Decryption Practice

#### Let's practice decrypting an encrypted medical record. Here is the algorithm again:

## **Algorithm**	

* #### **Step 1:** Copy the encrypted message into the first row.
* #### **Step 2:** Copy the key into the second row, and keep repeating it until the end. 
* #### **Step 2:** For each box in the third row: if the two boxes above it are the same (**both** white or **both** gray), color it gray.  Otherwise, leave it white. 
<br>

#### You'll be using a **new** key this time.

## Practice

#### Students will complete this activity using a paper activity guide. You might choose to use scratch paper to complete this practice activity.
