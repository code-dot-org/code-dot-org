Consider the following class, which uses the instance variable `currency` to represent the money in a purse in currency. The `addCurrencyToPurse` method adds money to increase the amount of currency in the purse.

```
public class Purse {

  private double currency;

  public double addCurrenyToPurse(int amount) {
    /* missing code */
  }
}
```

Which of the following code segments should replace missing code so that the `addCurrencyToPurse` method will work as intended?

The `addCurrencyToPurse` method is intended to add a specified amount to the `currency` instance variable and then return the new total amount of currency.

The missing code needs to:

1. Add the specified `amount` to the `currency`.

2. Return the new total `currency`.

So, the correct code to accomplish this would be:

```
currency = currency + amount;
return currency;
```

This code first adds `amount` to `currency`, increasing the value of `currency` by `amount`. It then returns the updated value of `currency`, which is the new total amount of money in the purse. This will ensure the `addCurrencyToPurse` method works as intended: adding an amount to the purse and then returning the new total amount.
