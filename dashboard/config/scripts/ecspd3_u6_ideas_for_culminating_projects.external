# Ideas for Culminating Projects, Portfolios, Etc.

## Overview

As you are considering an end of year final project, portfolio, or reflection piece that would demonstrate students understanding of the curriculum, you will want to consider a project that brings in the three strands of ECS, the computational thinking practices, and the process of problem solving.

Let's take a look at some possible curriculum connections to the units.
Unit 1 - Explore ethical issues relating to technology, privacy or security. 
Unit 2 - Use the problem solving process to address a concern in the school or community.
Unit 3 - HTML: Build a website for another teacher, local company.
Unit 4 - Create a review game, digital story, interview.
Unit 5 - Conduct market research: collect data on an issue and tell a story about your data.

Regardless the project, you need to consider the planning aspect. This will help your students articulate what they want to do, break it down into a manageable task and give you a chance to give feedback and facilitate the conversation.

Here is a Project Design Rubric to help give you some guidance - <a href="http://bie.org/object/document/project_design_rubric"target=_blank>Design Rubric</a>  

### Create a Project

You could use the framework from one of the following challenges that happen across the country as a start for your final project:

- <a href="http://appchallenge.tsaweb.org/rubric"target=_blank>Verizon Innovation App Challenge</a>

A great resource that was recently shared on the CS10K Community by Leslie Aaronson was a webinar and presentation on Using Computing for Social Good.  You can refer to the pdf she shared and other documentation that makes for a great project: <a href="https://cs10kcommunity.org/sites/default/files/event/2016/02/cs10k_community_ecs_social_good.pdf" target=_blank>Resource Links for Final Project - Using Computing for Social Good.</a>  The webinar gave some great insight on the following:

### Portfolio

Have students create portfolio using PowerPoint or web site, where the students have a slide or pages dedicated to one unit or all units on that slide show artifacts and a description of what they learned and why they chose that one.
