# Choosing Good IDs

**Good IDs** are **meaningful and descriptive**.

Just like good names for functions, you will want an ID to describe the intended purpose of the element.  

For example, if you have many buttons in your program, you will want to give each an ID that describes what the button does. 

So, instead of this:
 
 * `button1` and `button2`

You might make IDs that convey not only that it's a button but what you intend the button to be used for, like:

 * `forwardButton` and `leftButton` or
 * `fwdBtn` and `leftBtn` or
 * `forwardBtn` and `leftBtn`
 * it's up to you!

# Rules About IDs
In making descriptive and meaningful IDs there **are some rules about IDs** you need to know.  IDs...

* are case-sensitive
* cannot contain spaces.
* *must* begin with a letter (A-Z or a-z) and may be followed by any number of digits and letters.
* can contain hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons (":"), or periods (".").

**Why no spaces?** 

Many computer systems do not allow function names and IDs to contain spaces. We typically use camelcase in our lessons. 

You've already seen several examples like this: `moveForward`, `onEvent`, `turnLeft`, etc.  It's important to realize that camelcase is a style convention, not a hard and fast rule of JavaScript.

**Case-sensitive?**

This means there is a difference between `LeftBtn` and `leftBtn`  (notice the Capital L on the first one).

These differences seem annoying at first, but you get used to it, and actually learn to appreciate the fact that the computer requires such precision.

There are a few common styles for capitalizing and spelling multi-word IDs:

* **"Camelcase"** -- `aCamelcaseNameMightLookLikeThis`
* **Underscores** -- `Some_people_like_to_use_underscores_to_separate_words`
* **dashes** -- `Others-like-to-use-hyphens-or-dashes`

Whatever you choose is up to you.  It's your style.  It just helps to be consistent.
