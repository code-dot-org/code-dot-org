#### The goal of the activity in lesson 5 is for students to walk away with a core issue that their group can focus problem-solving skills on when they move to Ideating and beyond.

 <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">As a <span style="color: #0093A4;">{describe your user}</span>, I <span style="color: #0093A4;">{action connected to data}</span>.</p>

## Example:
