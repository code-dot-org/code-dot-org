## Find the learning experience that works for you

We recognize online learning is not for everyone.  This online course does not include an instructor or way to communicate in real-time with peers. If you find yourself needing more one-on-one attention or know you learn better in a facilitator-led workshop where there is opportunity for collaboration and engagement with others, consider participating in one of our <a href="http://code.org/professional-development-workshops" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in-person professional development opportunities</a>.

## Begin this online course

This online course is made up of three parts:

* **Part I:  Teaching and Implementing CS**, gets you started in using teacher tools and resources.  In addition, Part I introduces you to computer science teaching practices and strategies focused on inclusion.

	* Note:  If you have participated in a Code.org in-person professional development workshop, use Part I as a refresher or go on to Part II to dive deeper into Computer Science Fundamentals concepts. 

	* Click "Continue" to begin Part I.

* **Part II:  Concepts in Courses A - F**, takes you through videos, puzzles, and curriculum resources students will use to learn about computer science concepts and skills included in Computer Science Fundamentals courses. 

	* <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/k5-onlinepd-2021/lessons/6/levels/1" target="blank" >Click here to begin Part II.</a>

* **Part III:  Next Steps**, guides you in identifying next steps after this course to learn more about computer science and bring Computer Science Fundamentals courses to all of your students.
