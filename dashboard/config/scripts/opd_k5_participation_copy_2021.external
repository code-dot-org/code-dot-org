## Find the learning experience that works for you

We recognize online learning is not for everyone.  This online course does not include an instructor or way to communicate in real-time with peers. If you find yourself needing more one-on-one attention or know you learn better in a facilitator-led workshop where there is opportunity for collaboration and engagement with others, consider participating in one of our <a href="http://code.org/professional-development-workshops" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in-person professional development opportunities</a>.
