markdown <<MARKDOWN
How many bytes (or bits) are required to encode an image that is 25 pixels wide and 50 pixels tall, if you encode each pixel with 3 bytes (24 bits) of RGB data.

(Don't forget to add in the metadata! -- you should assume that we are using the file format used in this lesson with metadata that had 1 byte each for width, height and bits-per-pixel.)

The correct answer is: **3,753 bytes (30,024 bits)**

Here is the caclulation:

* (25 pixels) * (50 pixels) = 1250 pixels...

* (1250 pixels) * (3 bytes of RGB *for each* pixel) = 3,750 bytes of RGB data...

* (3,750 pixel data ) + (3 bytes of meta data) = **3,753 bytes** (multiply by 8 for number of bits: 30,024)
