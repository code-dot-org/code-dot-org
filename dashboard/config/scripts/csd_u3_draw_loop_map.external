# The Draw Loop

## Animations

An animation uses a series of pictures to create the illusion of smooth movement. Each individual picture is called a frame. You'll usually need to see at least several frames a second for the movement to look smooth. One way you may have seen this before is with a flipbook, like in this example, but movies or GIF files work the exact same way.

## The Draw Loop

To create animations in Game Lab you'll need a way to keep drawing frame after frame. The `draw` function is special. The way programs run in Game Lab is

1. Run every piece of code outside `draw`
2. Keep running the code inside `draw` over and over again, 30 times a second

Each time it runs is like a new page in a flipbook. By making small changes to what's drawn each time you can use Game Lab to create animations. 

## Draw Loop with Shapes

| Code | Animation |
|---|---|

This program sets the fill color and turns off the stroke outside the draw loop. Then `draw` is run over and over this program will keep drawing dots in random locations forever.

## Draw Loop with Sprites

| Code | Animation |

This program creates a sprite and sets its animation outside the draw loop. Then it repeatedly gives the sprite a new x location and redraws the orange background and the sprite to make it move.
