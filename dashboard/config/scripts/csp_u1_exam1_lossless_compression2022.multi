question 'Which of the following is true of lossy and lossless compression algorithms?'
wrong ‘Lossy compression algorithms are used when perfect reconstruction of the original data is important.’
right ‘Lossy compression algorithms are typically better than lossless compression algorithms at reducing the number of bits needed to represent a piece of data.’
wrong ‘Lossless compression algorithms are only used to compress text data.’
wrong ‘Lossless compression algorithms only allow for an approximate reconstruction of the original data.’

**Explanation:** Since lossless compression keeps all the information from the original item, it cannot do as good a job of reducing the number of bits as lossy compression where some of the original information is lost. 

[Lesson 9 - Lossless Compression](https://curriculum.code.org/csp-20/unit1/9/) and [Lesson 10 - Lossy Compression](https://curriculum.code.org/csp-20/unit1/10/) demonstrated the similarities and differences between these two compression methods.

::: details [**Essential Knowledge Connected To This Question**]

* DAT-1.D.4: Lossless data compression algorithms can usually reduce the number of bits stored or transmitted while guaranteeing complete reconstruction of the original data.

* DAT-1.D.5: Lossy data compression algorithms can significantly reduce the number of bits stored or transmitted but only allow reconstruction of an approximation of the original data.

* DAT-1.D.6: Lossy data compression algorithms can usually reduce the number of bits stored or transmitted more than lossless compression algorithms.
