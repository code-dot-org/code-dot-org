wrong 'Storage, processing, or curation often present significant challenge when processing large datasets.'
wrong 'Data scientists typically combine multiple data sources as more can be learned when each data source is analyzed independently.'
wrong 'Information cleansing and classification are often employed in the processing of data by which patterns can emerge.'
right 'Metadata is only useful for datasets that are small enough to be analyzed by hand, so it is often not considered in modern data analysis.'

Learning Objective: **3.2.1** and Essential Knowledge statements: **3.2.1I**
<hr>
 (A) This option is incorrect. Many times all of these are an issue in big data analysis.  One of these are almost certainly going to present as a problem in a large data analysis problem.

<hr>
 (B) This option is incorrect. Data scientists often combine data sets to find new insights that could not be found in the individual datasets.

<hr>
 (C) This option is incorrect. Both processes (cleaning and classification) are valid techniques employed by data scientists.

<hr>
 (D) This option is correct, because the statement is incorrect. Metadata has lots of useful information about data, and is often considered in analysis of datasets of all sizes.
