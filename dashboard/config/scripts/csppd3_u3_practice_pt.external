# Unit 3 Overview > Practice Performance Tasks

## What’s the role of Practice PTs in Unit 3?

There are two Practice PTs in Unit 3, which both help students prepare for the **Create Task.** Both practice PTs give students a chance to practice the type of writing and reflection that Create calls for, while modeling different types of collaboration (directly sharing the workload for one project, or working together as thought partners while creating a unique task).

**If you haven’t reviewed the Create Task recently, <a href="http://apcsprinciples.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/create-pt-march-2015.pdf" target=_blank>check it out here</a>**

### Lesson 8

The first practice PT happens at lesson 8, which is the end of the first chunk of lessons. Here, students are asked to work in a group where each member of the group contributes by developing functions that are used in the final project. After developing their programs, students reflect on the process, with prompts that are modeled after the real PT. Project planning guidance is given at the start of the project, with a process in place to understand the problem, brainstorm solutions, break it down, and assign roles within the group. See below to learn more about the group planning process:

### Lesson 30

The Unit ends with a culminating practice PT, which *very* closely mirrors the actual Create PT. Here, students  pick one of the projects they worked on so far and extend the program by adding functionality. They will work together with a thought partner who will provide feedback at different points along the development process (planning, implementation, and testing phases), but each person will be responsible for submitting a project.
