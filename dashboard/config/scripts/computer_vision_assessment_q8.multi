question 'Identify which of the following methods might lead to the least useful data when training a model and explain why.'
wrong 'Using a balanced dataset with an equal number of images for each category, because it prevents the model from being biased towards one category'
wrong 'Using labeled images with clear annotations, because it ensures the model learns from accurate data'
wrong 'Using a diverse dataset with images from different environments, because it increases the ability of the model to generalize'
right 'Using images with poor lighting and/or low resolution, because they provide unclear and insufficient details for accurate model training'
allow_multiple_attempts false
