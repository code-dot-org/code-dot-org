<h2 style="text-align: center;">Dance Party: Unplugged</h2>

#### Letâ€™s first dive into events by examining one of the unplugged lessons from the CS Maker course. 

#### An unplugged lesson is a teaching method where CS concepts are taught without the use of a computer. These lessons involve hands-on activities or games that illustrate computer science principles in tangible and understandable ways for beginners. 

#### In this lesson, students will learn to think about controlling actions using events. The students will match a dance move to an assigned shape and will act out the moves based on the shape you select. 

#### Take time to read the Unplugged Dance Party (lesson plan). Make sure to check out the resources including the student facing markdown level, slides, and event controller PDF.
