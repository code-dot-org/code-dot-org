# Web Development Mini-Projects 

##### **Mini-projects** are smaller projects that appear throughout the unit. These projects act as checkpoints in the curricula and cover a smaller set of skills than the entire unit. We recommend using these opportunities for formative assessment.

**Question of the Day:** How can I use HTML to express a personal value?

**Lesson Overview:**

Students use what they have learned to create their own personal web page on a topic of their choice. The lesson starts with a review of the HTML that students have learned. They begin their project by designing a web page and identifying which tags they will use to implement it. They then create their web pages in Web Lab and share with the class. Optionally, after engaging in a formal feedback process, they may make final changes to their websites before reflecting on their process. This project is intentionally open-ended and flexible to allow classes to spend one or several days, depending on the pacing needs of the students or the school calendar.

**Students will be able to:** 
* Create a simple webpage using HTML

## Pacing Recommendation

##### Though they are only scoped for a single day, teachers may decide to extend these projects as a way to support or challenge students. Extending these projects may allow you to revisit difficult concepts or support students who may have missed lessons and are trying to catch up.
