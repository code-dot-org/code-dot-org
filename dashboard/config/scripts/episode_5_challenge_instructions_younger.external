## Instructions

### Sprite Lab

* The beginner Sprite Lab levels includes a copy of the working virus simulation code. Modify it by changing the sprite costumes or adding more sprites to the screen. 

* For the intermediate Sprite Lab level, challenge yourself to add new features to the simulation. What if you added walls to simulate social distancing? Could you add a counter to count how many sprites are infected?
