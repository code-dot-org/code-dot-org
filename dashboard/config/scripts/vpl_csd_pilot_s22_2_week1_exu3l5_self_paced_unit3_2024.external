# Foundational Lessons

#### The first several lessons of the unit help students build foundational knowledge that they will continue to draw upon as they move through the unit. The following information is designed to give you an overview of the first week or so of instruction. We will go more in-depth and give you time to practice these foundational programming skills in the next section of this professional learning module.

#### **Question of the Day:** How can we design animations and games based on the needs of a user?

### **Lesson Overview:**

#### Students begin by investigating the design of different animations and games. Students look at a variety of animations and games and attempt to match each design with a potential user. Then students choose a user and attempt to prototype an animation or game design for them on paper or in a digital template. To conclude the activity, students consider what it means to be an animation and game designer and create resources for other users.

### **Students will be able to:** 
* #### Understand the steps of the problem-solving process
* #### Identify features of an animation or game design that match the needs of users
* #### Create a prototype of an animation or game design to meet the needs of a user using the problem-solving process

#### **Question of the Day:** How can we clearly communicate how to draw something on a screen?

### **Lesson Overview:**

#### Students explore the challenges of communicating how to draw with shapes and use a tool that introduces how this problem is approached in Game Lab. The warm up activity demonstrates the challenges of communicating position without some shared reference point. In the main activity, students explore a Game Lab tool that allows students to interactively place shapes on Game Lab's 400 by 400 grid. They then take turns instructing a partner how to draw a hidden image using this tool, accounting for many challenges students will encounter when programming in Game Lab. 

### **Students will be able to:** 
* #### Communicate how to draw an image in Game Lab, accounting for shape position, color, and order
* #### Reason about locations on the Game Lab coordinate grid

#### **Question of the Day:** How can we communicate to a computer how to draw shapes on the screen?

### **Lesson Overview:**

#### Students are introduced to Game Lab, the programming environment for this unit, and begin to use it to position shapes on the screen. They learn the basics of sequencing and debugging, as well as a few simple commands. At the end of the lesson, students will be able to program images like the ones they made with the drawing tool in the previous lesson.

### **Students will be able to:** 
* #### Sequence code correctly to overlay shapes.
* #### Use a coordinate system to place elements on the screen.

#### **Question of the Day:** How can we use parameters to give the computer more specific instructions?

### **Lesson Overview:**

#### In this lesson students continue to develop their familiarity with Game Lab by manipulating the width and height of the shapes they use to draw. The lesson kicks off with a discussion that connects expanded block functionality (e.g. different sized shapes) with the need for more block inputs, or "parameters". Students learn to draw with versions of ellipse() and rect() that include width and height parameters. They also learn to use the background() block.

### **Students will be able to:** 
* #### Use and reason about drawing commands with multiple parameters

#### **Question of the Day:** How can we use variables to store information in our programs?

### **Lesson Overview:**

#### In this lesson students learn how to use variables to label a number. Students begin the lesson with a very basic description of the purpose of a variable within the context of the storage component of the input-output-storage-processing model. Students then complete a level progression that reinforces the model of a variable as a way to label or name a number.

### **Students will be able to:** 
* #### Identify a variable as a way to label and reference a value in a program
* #### Use variables in a program to store a piece of information that is used multiple times

#### **Question of the Day:** How can we make our programs behave differently each time they are run?

### **Lesson Overview:**

#### This lesson introduces randomness, which is important both as a way to make programs more interesting and also to motivate the use of variables. Students are introduced to the randomNumber() block and how it can be used to create new behaviors in their programs. They then learn how to update variables during a program. Combining all of these skills, students draw randomized images.

### **Students will be able to:** 
* #### Generate and use random numbers in a program
* #### Update a value stored in a variable
