Which of the following best describes the value returned by the procedure below?

    PROCEDURE mystery (data)
    {
        count = 0
        i = 1
        REPEAT UNTIL (i = LENGTH(data))
        {
            IF (data[i] < data[i+1])
            {
                count = count + 1
            }
            i = i+1
        }
        RETURN (count)
    }

The answers below refer to values being in _ascending_ and _descending_ order.  Ascending order means increasing, as in: [1, 2, 5, 8].  Descending order means decreasing, as in [20, 15, 7, 3].

Looking at the code, _count_ is set to 0 and at the very end, _count_ is returned. Therefore, we already know that a count of something will be returned. Going through the code:

* i is set to 1
* The code inside the loop is repeated until it reaches the end of the data length
* If the data at index i is less that the value at the next index, count is incremented by one
* i is incremented by 1 until it reaches the end of the list

Since count is returned, the number of adjacent items that are in ascending order is returned.
