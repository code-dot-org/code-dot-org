# About Code.org

> <img src="https://images.code.org/d7b27d5c36fea4bfa38e9415bd712d0e-image-1667244505864.png" alt="code.org logo" style="float: left; height: 50px; clear: both; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;"> Code.org is a nonprofit dedicated to **expanding access to computer science** in schools and increasing participation by young women and students from other underrepresented groups. 

##### Code.org's vision for CS education is that **every student in every school** has the opportunity to learn computer science. In order to make this vision a reality, Code.org:

* ##### Builds free computer science curriculum.
* ##### Trains teachers to teach computer science. 
* ##### Advocates for policy change in support of CS Education. 

## Access to Computer Science Education

> #### More important than the tech workforce pipeline, **computer science is now a foundational subject for all 21st century careers,** making access to this knowledge an equity issue that must be addressed. **A studentâ€™s opportunity should not be determined by the color of their skin, their family income, or the neighborhood they grow up in.** Access to computer science education is improving, but in many regions or the United States, disparities in access still exist.
