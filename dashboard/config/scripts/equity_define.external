## What does “equity” mean in a classroom context?

Equity in learning environments can be defined as legitimate and equal social and intellectual access to class content. This means that every learner should have a stake in, and be able to contribute to, class proceedings. Incoming privileged knowledge (i.e. knowing some CS ahead of time) should not advantage you in class (or more importantly, disadvantage others. Perhaps more simply put, “equity” in the classroom means [giving each student what he or she needs in the moment, not only creating a “fair” or “equal” learning environment](http://www.teachingblogaddict.com/2011/11/fair-isnt.html).
