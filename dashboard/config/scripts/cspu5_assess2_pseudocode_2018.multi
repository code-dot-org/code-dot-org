Consider the following segment given in pseudo code (see reference from previous question):

    IF (grade >= 70)
    {
        DISPLAY(“You passed!”)
    } 
    ELSE 
    {
        IF(grade <= 70){
          DISPLAY(“Time to start studying again!”)
        }
    }
    
    
What will be displayed if grade is set to 70?

**Content: Unit 5 Lessons 8, 9** -- nested if similar to else-if

Going through the code line by line if variable grade is set to 70:

* The IF statement checks to see if grade is greater than or equal to 70.
* Since 70 = 70, the condition is true and the code inside the first IF statement will be executed.
* "You passed!" is displayed.
