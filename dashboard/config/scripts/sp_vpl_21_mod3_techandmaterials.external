##### **This course requires each student to have access to their own internet-connected computer for each CS Discoveries lesson, whether in a classroom or computer lab setting.** Each computer must have a modern web browser installed. All of the course tools and resources (lesson plans, teacher dashboard, videos, student tools, programming environment, etc.) are online and accessible through a web browser.

##### **It is NOT required that students have access to internet-connected computers at home.** 

## Required Materials / Supplies
