## Make a list of the things you will need to do to prepare to teach a CS Discoveries lesson.

#### Consider the following when making your list:

* What do I need to prepare ahead of time? 
* When a lesson has resources to share with students, will I print these resources or post them to my school's learning management system?
* Do I need to modify the lesson timing to fit into my scheduled class time? 
* Are there other things I might need to consider while planning for a lesson?
