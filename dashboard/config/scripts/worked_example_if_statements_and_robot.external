# A Worked Example

The following shows a step-by-step, line-by-line execution of a 10-line program with if-statements that uses the AP pseudocode for if-statements and the robot.

The purpose of the example is to show:

* Code executes one line at a time from top to bottom.
* Each if-statement condition is checked in the order of execution
* The conditions of later if-statements may be affected by what did, or didnâ€™t happen, in earlier lines of code.

    Again, this page is largely meant as reference.
   
    You don't need to belabor the points here, as students will get **much more practice** with the "Will it crash?" activity.
   
    Remind students that this is here if they need to refer back to it when doing the next activity.
   
You have a few options for how to review this worked example:

* You may want to review this worked example as an entire class, projecting it on the screen.
* Have students read, individually, or in pairs, then follow up with a partner, or review questions.
* You may want to print - though it is a long-ish document to print, especially since the "will it crash" handout is long as well.

**Don't miss the problem** at the very end of the document.  Students should try it and you can review as a class to verify that they understand.
