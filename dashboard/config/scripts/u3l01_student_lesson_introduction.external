# Unit 3: Lesson 01 - The Need for Programming Languages

## Background

Algorithms are the way we express solutions to problems in the field of computer science. Once we've identified a problem we seek to create an algorithm that can be used to solve that problem and ideally a whole class of similar problems. The ability to express algorithms in a way that someone else (or a computer) can understand and use them allows us to solve a problem only once and then let that other person or machine worry about actually implementing our solution.

## Lesson

* Create instructions using only words to construct a specific arrangement of toy blocks.
* Test the clarity of your instructions by exchanging with another member of the class.
* Brainstorm strategies for effectively communicating the steps of an algorithm.
