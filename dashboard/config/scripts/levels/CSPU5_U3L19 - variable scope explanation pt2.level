Create a variable **outside** of any function.\n\n2. Create a variable **inside** a function.\n\nThe term for this concept is **\"variable scope.\"** The **scope** of a variable defines which parts of your code can access and modify the variable.\n\n# Understanding Variable Scope\n\nJavascript has two scopes: **global** and **local**. Here's the difference...\n\n<hr>\n<strong style=\"font-size: 20px; color: #00adbc\">Local Variables</strong><br>\n<table>\n<tr>\n  <td width=400>\n  <p>\n   Variables created <em>within a function</em> become <strong>local</strong> to the function. Local variables have <strong>local scope</strong>: they can <em>only</em> be accessed within the function.\n  </p>\n <P>\n In the example to the right we say that <strong>age</strong> is \"local to\" <strong>someFunction</strong> which means that only code within <strong>someFunction</strong> can access and modify the value <strong>age</strong>. Code that's outside this function <strong>cannot</strong> see or use the variable.\n </P>\n <p>\n In fact, local variables are <em>created</em> when a function starts, and <em>destroyed</em> when the function is completed. Local variables only exist for the life of one function call.\n </p>\n\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <img src=\"https://images.code.org/76e9fc4059384cca87c45b7e3647ae59-image-1446407129001.png\" style=\"width: 250px\">\n  </td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<hr>\n\n<strong style=\"font-size: 20px; color: #00adbc\">Global Variables</strong><br>\n<table>\n<tr>\n  <td width=400>\n  <p>\n  A variable declared outside a function, becomes <strong>global</strong>. \n   A global variable has <strong>global scope</strong> which means the variable is accessible and modifiable throughout your program by <em>any</em> code, and also in <em>any</em> function.\n </p>\n <p>\n In the example to the right we say that <strong>lives</strong> is a <strong>global variable</strong>.  \n </p>\n <p>\n \n </p>\n <p>\n \n \n </p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <img src=\"https://images.code.org/ac720d8ae4d6380fc72c8d6659910bcf-image-1446407286955.png\" style=\"width: 250px\">\n  </td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<hr>\n<strong style=\"font-size: 20px; color: #00adbc\">Why Use Local Variables?</strong><br>\n\nLocal variables are useful temporary placeholders for data that you need to perform a computation of some kind.\n\nOften a program might have several functions that perform different but related tasks, and you'd like to reuse variable names. Since local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables with the same name can be reused in different functions.\n\nThe best example of this is **function parameters**.  Function parameters are a form of local variable - they get created and initialized when a function is called, they get used while the function runs, and then they get destroyed when the function completes.\n\nImagine if all we had were global variables.  Then you **could not** write this code:\n\n![](https://images.code.org/539102916c458b6076643a7c7fd1eaa2-image-1446408316345.png)\n\nIf all variables had to be global we'd have to invent different variable names for every function parameter in the entire program. But because the **size** variable is **local** to the function, we can re-use this handy parameter name.\n\n\n<br><strong style=\"font-size: 20px; color: #00adbc\">Common Pitfalls with Local Variables</strong>\n\n* The most common mistake is something you just experienced: **accidentally re-creating a variable inside a function when you intended to reference a global variable**.\n\n* When you create a variable inside a function, and it happens to have the same name as a global variable, the **local variable takes precedence** and the function will try to use the local variable first.\n\n\n<hr>\n<strong style=\"font-size: 20px; color: #00adbc\">Why Use Global Variables?</strong><br>\n\nGlobal variables are useful for keeping track of data over the lifetime of the program that's running.  \n\nIf you want to keep track of some data between events, or between function calls, you want a global variable.\n\n<br><strong style=\"font-size: 20px; color: #00adbc\">Where to Create Global Variables</strong>\n\nBy convention global variables are created and initialized in the **very first lines of code** in a program.  \n\n<br><strong style=\"font-size: 20px; color: #00adbc\">Common Pitfalls with Global Variables</strong>\n\n* Because you can create a global variable *anywhere* in your code that is outside of a function definition, you can get yourself into trouble if you have variable declarations scattered throughout a large program.  You might accidently re-create or create a new variable for a purpose you've already made a variable for.  \n\n* **ADVICE:** Stick to the convention: if you need a global variable in your program, create it and give it an initial value at the very top of your program.  Keep all global variables in a group at the top where you can look them up.\n\n \n<hr>\n# Moving On...\nNow let's practice a little bit more with variables.  \n\nFor our programs coming up we're particularly interested in global variables since that gives us the ability to remember data like the score of a game over the life of a program.\n\n<a class=\"btn btn-large btn-primary next-stage submitButton\">Continue</a>\n"
