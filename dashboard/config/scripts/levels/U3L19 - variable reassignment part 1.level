    "markdown_instructions": "# Variable Reassignment part 1\r\n\r\nSo far we have only set a variable's value once.  But it's called a *variable* for a reason - its value can change (or vary) throughout a program. This is useful and necessary for keeping track of things like a score in a game.\r\n\r\nTo re-assign a value to a variable all you have to do is maintain the mental model of what's happening:\r\n\r\n  * Variables are containers for information\r\n  * The '=' sign is an instruction to set the value.\r\n  * A series of assignment statements (see example to right) is a list of instructions to execute one at a time - it's not a series of equations that define the state of the world.\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/066db834ae289ac538609b68c6492c4a-image-1445944263895.png\" style=\"float: right\">\r\n\r\n  * **Make a prediction**\r\n\r\n The code on the following screen looks like what is shown at right.  Study it rigth and now and make a prediction about what will happen when you run the code. What will the values of `a` and `b` be at the end of the program?\r\n\r\n* **Add console.log statements** \r\n\r\n Prove it to yourself by adding `console.log` statements at the end of the program to find out what the value of a and b are.\r\n \r\n* **NOTICE:** in the code above, after the variable `a` has been created using `var`, to change  only need to refer to the variable by its name.  The word `var` only needs to be used once - when the variable is created for the first time. \r\n\r\n* It's a **common mistake** to use `var` everytime you want to *use* a variable but just **remember `var` means CREATE a new variable**.  When you create a new variable it will lose its old value.  We'll look at errors related to this later.\r\n\r\n",
