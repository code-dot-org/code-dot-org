Paragraphs in HTML can be any length of text from one word to a bunch of sentences. All of your text in your web page should be contained in an HTML element (headers or paragraphs). Paragraphs group together sets of sentences and put some space between that group of text and the next group of text.\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>\n\n**How do I create multiple paragraphs?**\n\n</summary>\r\nParagraphs are marked by opening(`<p>`) and closing(`</p>`) tags as well. To create more than one paragraph you will want multiple sets of opening and closing `<p>` tags. For example\r\n<pre>\r\n\t&lt;p&gt;\r\n    \tThis is a paragraph.\r\n    &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\t&lt;p&gt;\r\n    \tThis is another paragraph.\r\n    &lt;/p&gt;\r\n</pre>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>\n\n**What is HTML?**\n\n</summary>\r\nStands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is used to add structure to the content of a web page. HTML uses tags to specify where certain structures start and end. These tags are sets of characters not found in the English language so that the content and structure can be differentiated. \r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>\n\n**What is an HTML element?**\n\n</summary>\r\nA piece of a website. Marked by a start tag and sometimes closed with an end tag. Also includes the content of the element as well. For example: \r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/fb4df62aa4d879f7021c567be2e28eea-image-1481135855001.png\" style=\"width:500px\">\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>\n\n**What is an HTML tag?**\n\n</summary>\n\nThe special set of characters that tells the machine where the start or end of an HTML element is and what type it is.\r\n\n\n</details>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n# Paragraphs\r\n\r\nNow that you have a header try to separate the two sentences like the example below using the paragraph element.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/12f8d4230fcd2144a5880815c8375149-image-1480364278934.12.18 PM.png\" style=\"width:300px\">",
