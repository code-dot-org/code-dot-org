The image doesn't have to be a perfect square, it can be long and skinny.\r\n* Optional: for fun, send your image bits to a friend using the <a href =\"https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit1/stage/11/puzzle/2\" target=\"_blank\">sending bits widget.</a> *(note: this is just a link to the sending formatted text level from a couple of classes ago)*\r\n\r\n\r\n",
