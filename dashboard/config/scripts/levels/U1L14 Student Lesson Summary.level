Accomplishing this task requires both technical know-how and an understanding of how human vision works. Digital images break a larger image into small squares on a monitor, called pixels, which can be individually illuminated. In a black and white image each pixel may either be turned on or off, and so can be represented by a single bit.\n# Vocabulary\n* Pixel: the fundamental unit of a digital image, typically a tiny square which contains a single color. Pixel is short for \"picture element\"\n* Metadata: data that provides more information or context about another piece of data\n\n# Lesson \n\n* Develop encoding scheme for B&W images\n* Experiment with Pixelation Tool\n* Incorporate metadata into encoding of a digital image\n \n# Resources \n\n* Activity Guide: <a href= https://docs.google.com/document/d/18WpGYeEQLw9jn0ymJJhnjFoLgcthRknenwpUYSGUPnE/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">B&W Images</a>\n\n\n<a class=\"btn btn-large btn-primary next-stage submitButton\">Continue</a>\n"
