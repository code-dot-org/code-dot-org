Now you'll have an opportunity to program your solution. Here are a few things to keep in mind:\r\n\r\n* Identify useful patterns that can be reused and give them **their own functions**.\r\n* Remember: The functions you design **can call one another**. This is how you create layers of abstraction.\r\n* Functions should be given names that are **descriptive and meaningful**.\r\n* Your program should be kicked off with a single call to a function that makes calls to subsequent functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/afed66de9dc3cdb10f627a176139c58f-image-1441822234028.09.33 PM.png)",
