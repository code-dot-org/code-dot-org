For example, you only had to press a key once to start the color wheel spinning, and it kept spinning forever. The code below uses if statements to make a fish sprite move in different directions.\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\n* Look at `if` statements that check the sprite's position and set its velocity.\r\n* With your partner, discuss what you think the code will do, and write your answer below.\r\n* Once you have submitted your answer, run the code.",
