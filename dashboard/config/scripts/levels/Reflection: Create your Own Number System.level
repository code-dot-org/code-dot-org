As you complete the activity, consider the misconceptions that your students may have and what sorts of questions you can ask to help them overcome these barriers.  \r\nNotes:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>There are many 'correct' answers to this activity. The important part is that rules are applied consistently. </li>\r\n<li> The difficult part of this task is not to find all of the shapes, but to create an ordering that does not ever repeat a pattern and articulating that ordering as a set of rules or a protocol. </li></ol>\r\n\r\n<a href= \"http://docs.google.com/document/d/1vFg7GG-kFJGw9MgxQ5g3yW7R5rE6f3udVK3C9Hj9P6E/edit\" target=_blank> Click here to Access Number Systems Activity</a>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n### <a href= \"http://forum.code.org/c/csp1/lesson04\" target=_blank> Head to the Forum >></a>\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Share Your Protocol and Ideas\r\nHead to the forum and share your ideas about this activity.
