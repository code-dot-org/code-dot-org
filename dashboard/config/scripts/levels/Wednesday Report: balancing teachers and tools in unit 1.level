Thinking about those lessons, and looking across the other lessons in <a href=\"curriculum.code.org/csp/unit1/\" target=_blank>unit 1</a>. Again, consider the following questions with your partner:\r\n\r\n- How have people wearing teacher hats been balancing their time leading or guiding with the student-hat’s time to get into activities and tools? \r\n- What strategies are effective in getting peoples’ attention once they’re lost in a tool?\r\n- What are your current thoughts about the appropriate balance of teacher-guided time VS time in the tools or with the activities? \r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n> Once you've had a chance to think about what you've seen today,  work with your partner to develop a set of recommendations about balancing the teacher and the tools in Unit 1. Your recommendations might include:\r\n\r\n>- Which lessons or activities present the biggest challenges with balancing teachers and tools? \r\n- What recommendations do you have related to balancing teachers and tools in Unit 1?  \r\n\r\n<br>\r\nUse the space below to record your recommendations (you'll share them tomorrow).
