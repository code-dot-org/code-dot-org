It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect.

Teaching CS often means you have even fewer colleagues who understand the unique challenges of teaching the topic.  We have come together periodically for these events, but knowing that this is our last official workshop together we want to pause to think about what getting support will look like in the future.  Some of this support may come from the people you have met from our workshops this year, but there is additional support available outside of this community as well.\r\n\r\nIn the next level we will look at specific opportunities to connect with your local and national CS community. \r\n\r\n## Reflect:\r\nWhat do you think you will need from your local or national CS community moving forward?  Consider, what has been helpful this year?  What challenges are you still facing that the community could support?",
