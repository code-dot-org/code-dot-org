This will be your copy of the app, and the copy that you will start to add code to in the next lesson.\r\n\r\n* Collect all of the sharing urls for your team's pages\r\n\t* You can find the share url by going back to the last level of the previous lesson, or by finding the screen in your [projects directory](/projects)\r\n* Import each of the screens, one at a time\r\n\t* If you run into an ID error with one of the screens, discuss the issue with the screen's creator so it can be fixed and imported\r\n* Delete the default \"screen1\"\r\n* Set the main screen as the default\r\n\r\nDon't worry about adding any code at this point; we'll get to that in the next level.",

Any issues that students encounter when importing their teammates' screens can only be resolved through teamwork, and will likely be a problem for all members of the team.",
