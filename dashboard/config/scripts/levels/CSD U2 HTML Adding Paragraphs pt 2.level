Paragraphs in HTML can be any length of text from one word to a bunch of sentences. Paragraphs group together sets of sentences and put some space between that group of text and the next group of text.\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>**How do I make multiple paragraphs?**</summary>\r\nHere's an example of several paragraph tags in a row. This code would be placed inside of the body of your web page.\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n`<p>This is a paragraph. It has two sentences.</p>`\r\n`<p>This is another paragraph.</p>`\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n# Use Paragraph Tags\r\n\r\nThe `<p>` tag or \"paragraph\" tag is placed around text to indicate that it is part of a paragraph. Placing text in a paragraph tag lets the computer know that it should be displayed differently, usually just by spacing it out from other text.\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\n* Place the text you just wrote inside at least two separate paragraphs by surrounding it with `<p>` and `</p>` tags\r\n* Compare the results with a neighbor. What has changed about the way your text is displayed?",
