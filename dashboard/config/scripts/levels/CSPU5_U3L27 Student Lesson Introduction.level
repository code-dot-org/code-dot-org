We have already seen several functions that return values, for example `randomNumber` and `getText`. The ability to write your own functions that return values allows you to reuse useful calculations at many places in your program, and is a further step in creating generally useful programs.\n\n## Vocabulary\n\n**`return`:** a command used to end execution of a function and resume execution at the point where the function was called.\n\n**Return Value:** a value that is passed when a function returns to the place in the code where the function was called, potentially to be used in further computation.\n\n## Lesson\n\n* Introduction to the use of the `return` command.\n* Write functions that return values.\n* Use functions that return values to analyze information stored in an array.\n\n## Resources\n\n* Activity Guide: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rGKhRhH5pzJJfYBa_tZy96-bg-SWgSbf_nomluTl18U/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">Go Fish</a>\n\n<a class=\"btn btn-large btn-primary next-stage submitButton\">Continue</a>\n",
