Decomposition? \r\n* How can you highlight opportunities for students to engage in the process of continuous improvement in order to modify and enhance creative projects? \r\n* How can you highlight opportunities for students to break large problems into smaller components in order to begin taking small steps towards the larger goal?\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12px;\"> If more space is needed, click and drag the bottom-right corner to adjust the size of the text box.</span>\r\n",
