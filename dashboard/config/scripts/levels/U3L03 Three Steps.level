So...\r\n\r\n**Define** a new function named `drawSide()` which makes three calls in a row to `drawStep()` followed by a `moveForward()` and `right()`.  \r\n\r\n**Replace** the original function call to `drawStep()` with a call to your newly defined `drawSide()` function. \r\n\r\nThe diagrams below show the intended actions.\r\n<table>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>![](https://images.code.org/480f6787e4d2daf34d67642e25b29de6-image-1441772552026.png) </td>\r\n<td>![](https://images.code.org/02f52d406854d6f86535adf2f593ccc9-image-1441772709549.gif) </td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n",
