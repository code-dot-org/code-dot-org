It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect.

It's important to note that learning how to program using App Lab is not the objective of Unit 4. Instead the focus is on students understanding there are other roles in software development (product management, marketing, design, testing) and using what they learn as a tool for social impact. Students will be primarily working in Design Mode within App Lab.\r\n\r\n**Prompts:** \r\n\r\n* **Referencing Resources:** \r\n\t* What resources are available for students to reference during this lesson? \r\n    * How can these resources be used to support a culture of active learning within your classroom?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n* **Role of the Teacher:** \r\n\t* How can you model the skill of referencing resources for your students? \r\n    * How does this support a culture of active learning within your classroom? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12px;\">**Note:** Reflections are a time to process or apply learning from the asynchronous work.  Only cohort's facilitators will see these reflection responses, not other participants. Facilitators will use them to plan for the upcoming synchronous call.
