This means you need to draw it by moving and *turning right*.  **But there there is no command to turn right!** \r\n\r\nHow do you turn right when the only command you have is `turnLeft()`?  You need to figure it out.\r\n\r\n## One Subgoal - multiple lines of code <img src=\"https://images.code.org/ae8ac9b14b7c016437455d07fdbb6a7c-image-1508440383741.png\" style=\"float: right\">\r\nSometimes a single subgoal like `// Orient Turtle` might require several lines of code to accomplish. \r\n\r\nFor example in this problem the *goal* of orienting the turtle for each right turn means turning left a few times.  So you would add multiple `turnLeft()` commands under a single `//Orient Turtle` subgoal. (shown at right).\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear: both\"> </div>\r\n\r\n# Do this\r\n\r\n\r\n* We've again added subgoals to solve this problem into the workspace.  Notice that we still only use `Move turtle` and `Orient turtle`.\r\n* Add code beneath each subgoal, to draw a 1 x 1 square by moving and *turning right*.\r\n* Reminder: The program should stop with turtle in its original position, facing its original direction.\r\n\r\nWhen you're done click the `Finish` button to move onto the next problem.\r\n\r\n",
