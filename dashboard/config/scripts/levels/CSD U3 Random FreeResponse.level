The `randomNumber()` block allows you to write programs with a little bit of randomization in them, which is also helpful when you you want images that look more natural - for example drawing a lots of stars in the sky in random positions, instead of selecting the x and y for each star.\r\n\r\n# console.log() \r\nThe `console.log()` block is a useful tool for testing and debugging - anything that you place into `console.log()` block's input will be printed to the debug console, which you can find below your code.\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\nYou will **not write any code** in this level.\r\n\r\n* Read the program provided\r\n* **Predict** what the provided program will do and write your prediction in the box below. **Be specific!**\r\n* Run the program several times and **record** the results.\r\n* **Discuss the results with a neighbor**.
