The more formal way to say this is that Boolean expressions *evaluate* to either true or false.  That means that when the computer processes a Boolean expression, it checks to see whether the expression describes a situation that is true or false, and then uses the value of either true or false wherever the expression is found.\r\n\r\nSome examples of Boolean expressions that evaluate to true are `3 > 1` and `4 <= 7`, but press students to think of expressions that might be better represented by variables, such as `studentAge < 70` or `sizeOfClass > 2`.\r\n\r\nSome examples of Boolean expressions that evaluate to false are `4 == 7`, `schoolName == \"Hogwarts\"`, and `currentYear < 1000`.
