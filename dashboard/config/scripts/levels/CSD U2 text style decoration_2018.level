It specifies which elements will have to follow the rules inside the curly braces. The `p` stands for paragraph.\r\n* `text-decoration: underline;` is the rule that makes the text inside the `h1` tag underlined.\r\n * `text-decoration` is the _property_.  It explains what the rule is about, in this case where the line goes.\r\n * `underline` is the _value_.  It explains how the rule should be applied, in this case making the test underlined.\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>**What are the possible values for text decoration?**</summary>\r\nYou can choose between \"underline\", \"overline\", and \"line-through\".  You can read more about the text-decoration property at <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_text_text-decoration.asp\">W3Schools - CSS text-decoration Property</a>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>**Why do I need all the punctuation?**</summary>\r\nThe punctuation, such as the curly braces `{}`, the colon `:`, and the semicolon `;`, help the computer to understand the rules in the stylesheet.  The curly braces hold all the rules for a particular selector.  Each rule should end in a semicolon, and the properties and values are always separated by a colon.\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>**What is a stylesheet?**</summary>\r\nA style sheet is a document that controls how a web page will appear.  External style sheets are separate files that are linked to the HTML page.\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>**What is CSS?**</summary>\r\nCSS is a language that controls the way content on a web site appears.  It uses rule-sets to change the look of a page.  Each rule set has a selector, which specifies which elements on the page will be affected, and the rules, which explain how to display the elements.   Each rule consists of a property and a value for that property.\r\n\r\n\r\nHereâ€™s an example of a rule-set that makes the text in an `h2` tag blue and cursive:\r\n\r\n<pre>h2 {\r\n   color: blue;\r\n   font-family: cursive;\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nIn this example, `h2` is the selector, `color` and `font-family` are properties, and `blue` and `cursive` are the values for those properties.\r\n</details>\r\n</div>\r\n# Underlining\r\n\r\n* Find the code in the style sheet that makes the h1 tag underlined.\r\n* Change the text decoration and see which one you like.\r\n  * Choose from \"underline\", \"overline\", and \"line-through\"\r\n* Add a text decoration rule for the paragraph or h3 tag.",
