    "markdown_instructions": "# Asynchronous Commands\r\nAs you just saw, **the callback function for a `readRecords` command does not run immediately**. In fact, **commands outside of the callback function will run**. \r\n\r\nWe say that the callback function of `readRecords` is **asynchronous**, because the rest of your program will not wait for the response from the database; it will continue executing, and eventually the callback function will be triggered once the data has arrived from the database.  \r\n\r\n<details><summary><strong>Terminology: Synchronous vs. Asynchronous</strong> [Click to expand]</summary>\r\n<P>\r\n\"Asynchronous\" is the opposite of \"synchronous\".  In programming, we talk about whether <strong>functions are synchronous or asynchronous</strong>.\r\n</P>\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>Synchronous</strong> (or \"in sync\") - things happening at the same time.  \"The dance moves were in sync with the music.\" \r\n<ul><li>When functions are \"synchronous\", if Function A calls or triggers Function B, Function B will execute immediately, at the moment it's called, and A will wait for B to complete before continuing on.\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>Asynchronous</strong> (or \"NOT in sync\") - things happening at different times or not in a prescribed sequence. \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>When functions are asynchronous, if Function A calls or triggers Function B, Function B will execute at some <strong>later time in the future, and A will continue without waiting for B.</strong> </li>\r\n<li>Asynchronous functions are used especially when the Internet is involved, because sending a request for data and getting it back can take time. The setup is common: send a request for data, and as part of the request specify what <i>should happen when the data eventually comes back.  This is what the callback function is for.</i></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</p>\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nThis allows your program to keep running while you wait for responses from the database, but **asynchronous commands can make it challenging to keep track of the order your program will run in**.\r\n\r\nYou typically think of programs waiting for one command to finish before running the next. This style of programming is referred to as **synchronous** and is generally much easier to read and write.\r\n\r\n# Callback Functions are like Event Handlers\r\n\r\n**Event handlers** for UI elements can be triggered at any time. You cannot know ahead of time when the event will be triggered, **so all the code that should run when the event is triggered needs to go in the event handler**.\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/a6303ef07bf90ddf22f77950dd29a971-image-1449691163707.gif)\r\n\r\nThe same thing is true with the callback function for data commands. **If a piece of code should run after a response has been received from the database it must be placed in the callback function**.\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/7908fa39f133ec1ce374f8e9943c5257-image-1449692589680.gif)\r\n\r\n**Tip: Treat the callback function of a data command like an event handler. It gets triggered when you receive the response from the database**\r\n\r\n# Do This:\r\n\r\n**Your code from the previous exercise** is provided.\r\n\r\n* **Move your second `console.log` command inside the callback function**.\r\n* **Run the program** and pay close attention to **the order in which the commands run**. You can **check the Debug Console** to see which `console.log` command ran first.",
