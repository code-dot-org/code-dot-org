If you haven’t already reviewed the materials, do that now and come back to this task later.**\r\n\r\n\r\n# Unit 5 Teaching Practice Plan: Balancing Teacher and Tools\r\n\r\nFor this task, you’re going to develop and submit a Teaching Practice Plan, which details your general plan for managing technology throughout unit 4, as well as a specific plan for a computer-based lesson (which for unit 5, is almost every lesson).\r\n\r\nYour plan should be broken into two parts, and address the following: \r\n\r\n- General strategies that you’ll apply throughout unit 5\r\n  - Throughout unit 4, what classroom and technology management techniques will you use to help students stay focused on the lesson tasks? \r\n\r\n- Strategies specific to a selected lesson\r\n  - Which lesson are you discussing? \r\n  - What is your plan for managing transitions between your instruction and students being in App Lab? *Note: your response should include specifics about the lesson*\r\n  - How do you plan to introduce the lesson challenge as well as any new features or programming concepts that have been added to App Lab since the last lesson? *Note: your response should include specifics about the lesson*\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can type out your teaching practice plan in the box below, or you can upload a word doc or pdf file. \r\n\r\n## Getting Credit for Completing this Task\r\n\r\n#### Task Review Details\r\n\r\nIf this module is listed as  your “focus area”, then your response to the prompt above will be shared anonymously and reviewed by your peers, and you will review the work done by other teachers. Reviewers will be looking for thoughtful and thorough answers that demonstrate that you have spent time considering how this practice will fit into your own classroom. Reviewers will have an opportunity to give feedback on your submission, and you can respond to that feedback and resubmit. \r\n\r\nIn order to get credit for completing this task, two reviewers need to agree that you have responded to the prompts fully. If reviewers don’t feel comfortable making a decision about your task submission, they can elevate to a facilitator to review. You will always have a chance to address feedback from your reviewers and resubmit your task! Reviewer feedback will show up at the bottom of this page, once it’s available. \r\n \r\n\r\n",
