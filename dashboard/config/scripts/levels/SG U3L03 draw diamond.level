Your final solution should be triggered by **a single call** to `drawDiamond()`. \r\n\r\n<table>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/65395/961892/NoxVhFlLf9HlybZ/upload.png\" width=200></td>\r\n<td><img src=\"https://images.code.org/dca51c5b17a8c0778787337c3609557c-image-1441802821237.gif\" width=200></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n**Notes**:\r\n\r\nIn the end you will have 4 functions defined:\r\n\r\n* drawDiamond()\r\n* drawSide()\r\n* drawStep()\r\n* right()\r\n\r\nThese 4 functions work sort of like a hierarchy of top-down design.  At the top is `drawDiamond()` which makes calls to `drawSide()`, which makes calls to `drawStep()` and `right()`.\r\n\r\nFor most programming problems that you face, the problem won't be broken down into pieces like it was for this series of puzzles. You'll have to figure out your own hierarchy of functions based on which patterns you want to use multiple times. This is why planning your solution ahead of time can make your code more efficient. \r\n\r\nSubgoals will help you do this. Once you recognize that the diamond can be drawn using the same function repeated 4 times, you can note with a subgoal comment that you'll need to define and call a function for `drawSide()`. Then you can figure out that one side can be drawn using the same function 3 times plus a couple of steps, you can make note to define and call `drawStep()`. Once you've planned the solution, you can fill in blocks to complete it.",
