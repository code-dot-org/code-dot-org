It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect.

It kicks off the project that students will be working on throughout the rest of the unit.  \r\n\r\n**Prompts:** \r\n\r\n* **Collaboration:** In what ways can you support students in developing solutions that incorporate multiple contributions?\r\n\r\n* **Mediate Disagreements:** How will you support students in developing the skills of mediating disagreements to help teammates agree on a common solution?\r\n\r\n* **Participation:** How will you ensure all members of the group actively contribute to the success of the team?\r\n\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12px;\">**Note:** Reflections are a time to process or apply learning from the asynchronous work.  Only cohort's facilitators will see these reflection responses, not other participants. Facilitators will use them to plan for the upcoming synchronous call.  Write as much or as little as is helpful for you -  a paragraph,  sentence, list, etc. If more space is needed, click and drag the bottom-right corner to adjust the size of the text box.</span>",
