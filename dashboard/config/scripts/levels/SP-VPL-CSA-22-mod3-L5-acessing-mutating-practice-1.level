Write code that will print the foods in the array in a sentence to the console.  \r\n2. Run your program and debug your code.  You should see the following sentence in the console after running the program:\r\n```\r\n“In this restaurant we serve jerk chicken, plantains, rice and beans, and curry goat.”\r\n```\r\n\r\n::: details [**Show Me How**]\r\n\r\nYou can obtain a value from an array using the following syntax:\r\n```\r\nvariableName[index]\r\n```\r\n`variableName` refers to the name of the array, and `index` refers to the location in the array.\r\n\r\nYou will use String concatenation to create this sentence.  For example, if your favorite colors were stored in an array called `colors`, you could print those colors in a sentence by putting together a String `My favorite colors are \" + colors[0] + \", \" + colors[1], + \" , and\" + colors[2]`.\r\n:::",
