For students who have never taken an AP Exam, it may feel intimidating.  For students who perhaps are taking multiple AP exams, it might feel overwhelming or exhausting.\r\n\r\nTeachers also can bring a lot of feelings to AP test prep.  Perhaps you are feeling hopeful about the scores.  Maybe you wish AP test scores were less of a focus for your students or your district.  Code.org has created a series of resources for you and your students to help prepare for the AP Exam.  Before we dig into these resources let's pause and reflect.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Reflect\r\n\r\n* How are you feeling about the AP Exam and the prep process? \r\n* How do you want students to feel during AP test prep and during the exam? \r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n**Up next:** We will take a look at the breakdown of topics on the AP CSA Exam.\r\n",
