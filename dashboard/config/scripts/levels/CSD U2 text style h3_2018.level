You can see a full list of CSS color names at <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp\">W3Schools - HTML Color Names</a>.  You can still use colors that are not included in the named list, but you will need to use their RGB values.  You can read more about using colors in CSS at <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors_legal.asp\">W3Schools - CSS Legal Color Values</a>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>\r\n<strong>How does the code work?</strong>\r\n</summary>\r\nHere is the code that is making the `h1` header red:\r\n\r\n<pre>h1 {\r\n  color: red;\r\n}</pre>\r\n\r\n* `h1` is the _selector_.  It specifies which elements will have to follow the rules inside the curly braces.\r\n* `color: red;` is the rule that makes the text inside the `h1` tags red.\r\n  * `color` is the _property_.  It explains what the rule is about, in this case the text color.\r\n  * `red` is the _value_.  It explains how the rule should be applied, in this case making the text red.\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>\r\n<strong>How do I make a new rule-set?</strong>\r\n</summary>\r\nTo make a new rule set, you'll need a selector and a list of rules.  The selector is the name of the tag you want the rules to be applied to.  The rules are a list of property and value pairs.  You'll also need to pay careful attention to the punctuation in the rule set.  Look at the code below for an example of how the code should look.  You'll need to change the specifics for your page.\r\n\r\n<pre>h1 {\r\n  color: red;\r\n}</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n* `h1` is the _selector_.  It specifies which elements will have to follow the rules inside the curly braces.\r\n* `color: red;` is the rule that makes the text inside the `h1` tags red.\r\n  * `color` is the _property_.  It explains what the rule is about, in this case the text color.\r\n  * `red` is the _value_.  It explains how the rule should be applied, in this case making the text red.\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>\r\n<strong>Why do I need all the punctuation?</strong>\r\n</summary>\r\nThe punctuation, such as the curly braces `{}`, the colon `:`, and the semicolon `;`, help the computer to understand the rules in the style sheet.  The curly braces hold all the rules for a particular selector.  Each rule should end in a semicolon, and the properties and values are always separated by a colon.\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>\r\n<strong>What is a style sheet?</strong>\r\n</summary>\r\nA style sheet is a document that controls how a web page will appear.  External style sheets are separate files that are linked to the HTML page.\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>\r\n<strong>What is CSS?</strong>\r\n</summary>\r\n\r\nCSS is a language that controls the way content on a web site appears.  It uses rule-sets to change the look of a page.  Each rule set has a selector, which specifies which elements on the page will be affected, and the rules, which explain how to display the elements.   Each rule consists of a property and a value for that property.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere’s an example of a rule-set that makes the text in an `h2` tag blue and cursive:\r\n\r\n<pre>h2 {\r\n   color: blue;\r\n   font-family: cursive;\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nIn this example, `h2` is the selector, `color` and `font-family` are properties, and `blue` and `cursive` are the values for those properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n# Making a new CSS rule-set\r\n\r\nThe block of code that gives rules for a particular tag is called a _rule-set_.  You can make a new rule set by copying the pattern you see in the rule-set for the `h1` tag.\r\n\r\n* Find the CSS rule-set in the style sheet that determines the styles for the h1 tag.\r\n* Using the same pattern, write a new CSS rule-set that will determine the style for the h3 tag.\r\n* Add code to set a different color for the h3 tags.",
