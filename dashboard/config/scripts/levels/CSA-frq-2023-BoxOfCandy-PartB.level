The piece of candy to be removed is the first piece of candy with a flavor equal to the parameter `flavor` that is encountered while traversing the candy box in the following order: the last row of the box is traversed from left to right, then the next-to-last row of the box is traversed from left to right, etc., until either a piece of candy with the desired flavor is found or until the entire candy box has been searched. \r\n\r\nIf the `removeNextByFlavor` method finds a `Candy` object with the desired flavor, the corresponding `box` element is assigned `null`, all other `box` elements are unchanged, and the removed `Candy` object is returned. Otherwise, `box` is unchanged and the method returns `null`. \r\n\r\nThe following examples show three consecutive calls to the `removeNextByFlavor` method. The traversal of the candy box always begins in the last row and first column of the box. \r\n\r\nThe following grid shows the contents of `box` before any of the `removeNextByFlavor` method calls. \r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/b1cb0f8842854e6d19ac23b49f96a082-image-1687365171951.32.48 PM.png)\r\n\r\nThe method call `removeNextByFlavor(\"cherry\")` removes and returns the `Candy` object located in row `2` and column `0`.
