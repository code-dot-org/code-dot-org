So far you have controlled all four-sides of a border at the same time. Sometimes you want to style just one border edge at a time. To do this we just add the name of the side to the property.  For example:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\np {\r\n\tborder-top-color: green;\r\n\tborder-bottom-style: solid;\r\n\tborder-right-width: 20px;\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/b38ebda06d6ce76bd59aa93fa050290c-image-1475159743251.30.18 AM.png\" style=\"width:400px;float:right\">\r\n\r\nStyle the note card so it looks similar to the image on the right.\r\n\r\n* Make the writing on the note card look like handwriting by using the font-family property and coloring it different than the rest of the text on the page\r\n* Make all note cards have a fixed width by setting the width of the notecard class to 500 pixels\r\n* Make the note card pop and look 3D using border properties.\r\n\t* Set the border color to the same color as the background of the card.\r\n    * Set the style to `outset`\r\n    * Set the width to a small number of pixels\r\n* Style the bottom border of all li elements to be black, solid, and 1 pixel.\r\n* Style the bottom border of all h3 elements to be red, solid, and 1 pixel.",
