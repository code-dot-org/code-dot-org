You can find this modified one-day project in the first of the three lesson plans dedicated to the end of unit project.  Let’s look at how these two projects are different. \r\n\r\n## Do this: \r\n\r\n* Navigate to the <a href=\"https://studio.code.org/s/csa3-2022/lessons/11\" target=\"blank\">first of the three lesson plans dedicated to the Unit 3 project</a>.  The image below shows the links you will use on this page. \r\n* Read the lesson plan associated with the one-day project. \r\n* Read the project planning guide associated with the one-day project. \r\n* As you read this modified version of the project, consider the big differences you notice between the three-day and one-day version of the projects.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/c6f9b12146c26d53a8b730e60f26ca67-image-1656888593288.41.43 PM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of lesson plan\" style = \"border:3px solid black\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## Reflect:\r\n\r\n* What are the big differences you notice between the three-day and one-day version of the projects?",
