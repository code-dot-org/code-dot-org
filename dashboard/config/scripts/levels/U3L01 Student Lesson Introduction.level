Understanding the most fundamental actions performed by a computer enables the programmer to create complex programs with global impact by merely combining the basics. In this lesson, you will begin the journey of converting human language to algorithms and computer directions.\n\n# Lesson\n\n* Create instructions using only words to construct a specific arrangement of toy blocks.\n* Brainstorm ways we can use specific language to improve algorithms. \n* Identify the most basic commands of building a block sculpture. \n\n\n# Resources\n* Activity: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1co3nP1pRZEFBnAYz5fvbUyfUMogfxjMhMZuJAwTpq_w\" target=\"_blank\">\nSculpture Algorithm</a> \n\n\n* Rubric: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UlhUQv3h_MBiD2AoQNPb5j_GGjTpaAkIzzBRImtMsv8\" target=\"_blank\">\nSculpture Rubric</a>\n\n<a class=\"btn btn-large btn-primary next-stage submitButton\">Continue</a>\n",
