If you are teaching this course as an AP course, you may need to pay closer attention to timing than teachers who are not teaching this as an AP course.  If you are not teaching it as an AP course, it can still be helpful to reflect on how the pacing of the course aligns to your goals for students.  The full course has 140 “45 minute lessons” in it.  This includes 15 “lessons” that are AP test-prep lessons.  \r\n\r\n## Checking your pacing\r\n\r\nTo check-in on timing do one of the following:\r\n\r\n1. Locate your Curriculum Guide that you used during your Summer Workshop and turn to page X.  Check your current pacing of the course against what you expected your pacing to be. \r\n2. Do some math:\r\n\r\n<li>\r\n<ul>\r\n&#8226 Calculate the average number of minutes you typically have your CSA students each week.\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n&#8226 Take this number of minutes per week and divide by 45.  This is roughly how many lessons you should be doing per week.\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n&#8226 Determine how many weeks students have currently been in class.\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n&#8226 Determine if you are on track by calculating how many lessons you should have covered in the year so far and how many you have actually covered.  We know that there are breaks, short weeks, and other activities that get in the way, but this should directionally give you the right information.\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n\r\n## After checking your pacing\r\n\r\nNow that you have an idea of where you are and where you “should” be, it is time to pause.  \r\n\r\n* **If you find yourself behind, that is OK!**  It is better to know now rather than later.  One way you can address this is by using the “1 day” version of the project.  You can find this version by looking at the first lesson plan connected to the project.\r\n* **If you are ahead of where you expected, that is OK!**  This gives you flexibility as you go through the rest of the curriculum to slow down when students need more time with material or provide students with more in-class work time on projects that they seem really engaged with.  \r\n* **If you are on target, that is OK!**  Perhaps you have been working really hard to adjust your pacing to get it to this “just right” space, or maybe this happened accidentally.  Either way, it can be comforting to know that from a pacing perspective, your course is right on track! \r\n\r\nPacing is something that you can continuously check in with throughout the year.  You may want to bring this up as a topic to discuss in your next synchronous call with your cohort as well. \r\n\r\n## Reflect\r\n* How does your current pacing impact your thinking about using the three-day or one-day version of the projects?",
