It's called a variable because it's a piece of memory in which you can change what's stored - its value can vary.\n* To **create** a chunk of memory to use in a program you use the `var` command.\n* To **assign** a value to a variable means to store a value in memory; you use the `=` operator.\n* Variable **re-assignment** typically means to change the value of a variable based on its current value.\n\n## Lesson\n\n* Understand the power of variables.\n* Learn programming statements to create, initialize, and change the values stored in variables.\n* Learn how to prompt a user for numeric input.\n* Solve several small puzzles and challenges related to moving values around in memory.\n\n\n## Resources\n* Tutorial videos: Introduction to Variables Part 1 and Part 2\n\n<iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/G41G_PEWFjE?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ijjVDBPwA1o?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<a class=\"btn btn-large btn-primary next-stage submitButton\">Continue</a>\n"
