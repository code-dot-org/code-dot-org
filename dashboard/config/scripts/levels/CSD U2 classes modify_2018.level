The `class=winter` inside the opening tag adds everything inside the tag to the class.\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>**What rules can be added to a class rule-set?**</summary>\r\nA class rule-set can have the same rules as any other type of selector.  If a rule does not apply to the content of the class (for example, using `font-size` on an element with no text), then the computer will ignore that rule, but still use the rules that work.\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>**Why does the selector have a period in front of it?**</summary>\r\nIn CSS, a period in front of a selector means that the selector is the name of a class.  If there is no period, it means that the selector is the name of an HTML tag.\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>**Why would a web developer use classes?**</summary>\r\nA web developer uses classes when some elements should be styled differently than others, even if they are the same tag.  Classes can also be used to give elements that have different tags the same style.\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>**I got different RGB values, but mine are right, too.**</summary>\r\nBecause RGB creates millions of different colors, some are so similar that people have a hard time telling them apart.  That means that there are multiple RGB values that are close enough to work for our winter color.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n</div>\r\n# Adding Rules\r\n\r\nYour winter words should all have the same color and font.\r\n\r\n* Find the CSS rule-set in the style sheet that gives the winter words their style.\r\n* Add a rule that changes the font of the winter words.  It can be any font, but it will need to be different from that of the other three seasons.\r\n* Add any other rules you'd like for your winter words.",
