Your response will be shared with your cohort facilitators, but not your full cohort. Facilitators will use this reflection to inform their planning for the upcoming synchronous call. Responses may be brief (ex: one or two sentences, bullets, etc.) **Note:** You can change the size of the text box by clicking and dragging the bottom-right corner of the text box.\r\n\r\n**Reflection Prompt** Think about your role as the teacher.
