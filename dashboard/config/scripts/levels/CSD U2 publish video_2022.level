They should make sure that they are not sharing any sensitive information, and that they have the rights to use all the content on the page.\r\n\r\nAs they began to share, they should also think about how they respect the work of other website publishers, in particular their classmates.  You may want to take some time to establish classroom norms around how they talk about and give feedback on their classmates' sites, as well as guidelines for using code that others have written. ",
