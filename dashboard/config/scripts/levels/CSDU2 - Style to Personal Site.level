Make a style sheet for each web page on your website\r\n2. Have one style sheet for your whole website to give it a more consistent feel.\r\n\r\nPick one of the two choices and style your website appropriately. Make sure to link the style sheet to the page(s) you want it to apply to. Also make sure that the `a` rule-set you created on the last level is applied to all your `a` tags.\r\n\r\nOnce your website is set up and connected, feel free to make improvements to any pages on your website.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this level:\r\n* Take a screenshot of your home page and save it somewhere on your computer so you can find it later (*Need help with how to screenshot? Check out this <a href=\"http://www.take-a-screenshot.org/\">website </a>.*)\r\n\r\n## Check List\r\n\r\n* All of your web pages are individual HTML files in this Portfolio Project\r\n* Navigation to all the pages exists at the top of each individual page\r\n* Style has been applied to all pages on the website",
