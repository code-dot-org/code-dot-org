It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect.

Understanding these mental models will help you understand the content in the unit and prepare you for engaging with datasets later in this module. *(Estimated time: ~35 minutes)*\r\n\r\n## Do This:\r\n\r\n* Watch the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/15D0W3_hQNsp_Ryn0ayL4os56wEYAZr6T/view?usp=sharing\" target=\"blank\">Loops Explore video</a>.  \r\n\t* Optional: If you want to follow along with the virtual manipulatives, you can find those <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12jD0v0YueLnMk4PM0R_DwLHpU96DAexBliA66A9saWA/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"blank\">here</a>.\r\n* Watch the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xtJOUY0eUtT-34IJqv_oW-L7LfTkUT7j/view?usp=sharing\" target=\"blank\">Traversals Explore video</a>\r\n\r\n**Note**: These videos are included as “Lesson Modifications” in the lesson plan for teachers who are unable to teach in person.  If you are able to teach in-person or in a virtual synchronous environment, we do not recommend showing the videos in class to students but rather having students engage with the content in a hands-on way as described in the original lesson plan. We have asked you to watch these videos to give you an idea of the mental model before engaging in other work in Code Studio.\r\n \r\n## Reflect\r\n\r\n* What similarities do you see between previous mental models you've seen and the mental models from these lessons? \r\n* How are these mental models different from those you’ve seen before?\r\n\r\n",
