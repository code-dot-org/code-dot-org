It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect.

You can see this information in <a href=\"https://studio.code.org/s/csa3-2022/lessons/11/levels/1/sublevel/1?section_id=4098340\" target=\"blank\">Code Studio</a>.\r\n\r\nBased on this user story, students will generate questions that will help them help the user.  Some example questions might include:\r\n\r\n* How many different artists are in the top 500 albums list?\r\n* How can I learn about new albums in a genre that I like?\r\n\r\n## Reflect\r\n* What other questions might students generate when looking at User Story A?  \r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size:11px;\">**Note:** Your cohort's facilitators will be able to see your response, but your response will not be seen by other participants in your cohort. Facilitators will use these reflections to inform their planning for the upcoming synchronous call, but the primary purpose of these reflections is to allow you time to process or apply what you learn in the asynchronous work. For that reason, feel free to write as much or as little as is helpful for you - this might be 2 paragraphs, 2 sentences, or a list, etc. You don't need to worry about spelling or punctuation in this space either - this is your space!</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size:11px;\">Finally, you can always adjust the size of the text box by clicking and dragging the bottom-right corner of the text box if more space is needed.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
