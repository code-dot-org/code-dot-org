To add navigation to your website you will need to add hyperlinks which connect your individual web pages. You can **add hyperlinks to your web page using the `<a>` element**.  The text you want to display as the hyperlink goes between the opening and closing hyperlink tags. The `<a>` element has an attribute `href` which is the location to link to.  The location of a local page is just the file path for that page. <br> <br>\r\n\r\nFor example to link to the unique houses page you would add the following code inside your `<body>` element. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n&lt;a href=”houses.html”&gt; Unique Houses &lt;/a&gt;\r\n</pre>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>\n\n**How do I add a hyperlink?**\n\n</summary>\n\nYou can **add hyperlinks to your web page using the `<a>` element**.

This is a link that will take you to the Odd Houses page at `houses.html`.\r\n* Discuss with a partner how the code works.\r\n  * Where does the file name go?\r\n  * Where does the label of the link go?\r\n* Below the hyperlink to the Odd Houses page add two new hyperlinks (`<a>`) to the following pages:\r\n    * Crazy Signs Page\r\n    * Guinness Book of World Records Page\r\n* Test it out to see if clicking the links take you to the other pages of your site.",
