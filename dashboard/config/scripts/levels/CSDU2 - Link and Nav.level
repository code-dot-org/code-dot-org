To add navigation to your website you will need to add hyperlinks which connect your individual web pages. You can **add hyperlinks to your web page using the `<a>` element**.  The text you want to display as the hyperlink goes between the opening and closing hyperlink tags. The `<a>` element has an attribute `href` which is the location to link to.  The location of a local page is just the file path for that page. <br> <br>\r\n\r\nFor example to link to the unique houses page you would add the following code inside your `<body>` element. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n&lt;a href=”houses.html”&gt; Unique Houses &lt;/a&gt;\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>**How do I add a hyperlink?**</summary>\r\nYou can **add hyperlinks to your web page using the `<a>` element**.
