We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect.

Let's expand our focus on student learning with the theme for this workshop -  “Learning through Creation”. When students are “Learning through Creation” their creations become the context for their learning. They are able to build knowledge as they build a product. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Reflection\r\nThink back to previous units when students built knowledge while building a product such as a website, app, or game.\r\n\r\n* What is a specific example from previous units when students have built knowledge while building a product?\r\n",
