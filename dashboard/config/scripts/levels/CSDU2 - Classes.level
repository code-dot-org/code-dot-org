Classes allow for the group of elements to have their own unique style.** This applies to elements on the same page or on separate pages.\r\n\r\nTo style using classes:\r\n\r\n1. First you need to mark the elements in html that will be in that class.  \r\n2. Second you need to write a style rule for that class. To write a rule for a class of elements, the selector for the rule is a `.` before the class name. \r\n\r\nFor example the code below would style the fancy class which has been set up for a paragraph element:\r\n\r\n| HTML file | CSS File | Result |\r\n| --------- | -------- | ------ |\r\n| <pre> &lt;p class=\"fancy\"&gt;Good Day&lt;/p&gt;</pre> |<pre>.fancy {<br>  color: darkblue;<br>  font-family: cursive;<br>} </pre>|<img src=\"https://images.code.org/05110876c62dafe72a7d0ddf34f7ae07-image-1475009963479.58.30 PM.png\" alt=\"result image\"> | \r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\nThere are lots of different `<h5>` elements on the page. We want to style them differently depending on what season they are associated with.\r\n\r\n* For each season put all the `<h5>` elements for that season in a class specific to that season. For example all the winter `<h5>` elements would be in the class \"winter\".\r\n* Style each class of `<h5>` elements with a different `color`",
