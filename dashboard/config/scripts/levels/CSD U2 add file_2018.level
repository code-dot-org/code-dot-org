External style sheets are separate files that are linked to the HTML page.\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>**What is CSS?**</summary>\r\nCSS is a language that controls the way content on a web site appears.  It uses rule-sets to change the look of a page.  Each rule set has a selector, which specifies which elements on the page will be affected, and the rules, which explain how to display the elements.   Each rule consists of a property and a value for that property.\r\n\r\n\r\nHereâ€™s an example of a rule-set that makes the text in an `h2` tag blue and cursive:\r\n\r\n<pre>h2 {\r\n   color: blue;\r\n   font-family: cursive;\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nIn this example, `h2` is the selector, `color` and `font-family` are properties, and `blue` and `cursive` are the values for those properties.\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>**How do I create a new style sheet?**</summary>\r\nTo create a new style sheet, click on the \"Add CSS\" button above the code area.\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>**What should I name my style sheet?**</summary>\r\nYou can name your style sheet anything, but it's better to choose a relevant name, such as \"style.css\" or \"aboutmestyles.css\" so that it's clear what the file is.  Your file should always end in the \".css\" extension.\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>**How do I rename a file?**</summary>\r\nTo rename a file, you can right click (or control click) on the file name and choose the \"Rename\" option.  This will allow you to type in a new file name.  Clicking on a file name after it is already highlighted will also allow you to rename the file.\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>**How do I add a style sheet to a web page?**</summary>\r\nTo add a style sheet to a web page, open up the code for the web page.  Inside the head tag, add the following code `<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"style.css\">`.  Then change \"style.css\" to the name of your style sheet.\r\n</details>\r\n</div>\r\n# Adding a Style Sheet\r\n\r\nThis is your project from before.  In the next level, you'll have a chance to add some different styles to it, but first, you need to add a style sheet, name it, and link it to your html page.\r\n\r\n1. Create a new style sheet for your project.\r\n2. Rename the style sheet file.\r\n3. Add your style sheet to your HTML page.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://cdo-curriculum.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/weblab_stylesheet.png\" style=\" max-width:500px\">",
