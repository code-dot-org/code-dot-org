Student work is focused on using data visualization to select features to train their model.\r\n- Once they create their model and test it, they are given the option to export their model\r\n\t- [I know we're still iterating on this step. I put it here to differentiate that this step isn't needed in the earlier AI-Lab lesson, but is needed here]\r\n    - Still do not need to complete a model card; this is introduced in a later lesson\r\n\r\n## Dataset / Model Notes:\r\n- New: Multiple Pre-curated Real-World Datasets\r\n- Datasets don't have any \"useless\" columns (like \"Name\"); all columns fit nicely into continuous/categorical labels"
