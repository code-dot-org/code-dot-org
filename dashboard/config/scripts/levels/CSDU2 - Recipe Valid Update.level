In order to let the web browser know that this is an html document you need to tell it what type of document it is deal with (Doctype) and where to find the code (inside the html element).\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>**What is DOCTYPE and how do I use it? **</summary>\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; is always the first thing in an html document because it notifies the computer that this is an html document and to interpret it as such. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; is not technically a tag but instead an instruction to the web browser. <br> <br>\r\n\r\nAdd &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; at the very top of your html file.  \r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>**What is the HTML element and how do I use it? **</summary>\r\n\r\nThe &lt;html&gt; tag notifies the computer where the html starts and ends. The  &lt;html&gt; tag is the container for all other HTML elements (The &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; tag does NOT go inside the html element).  You will need an opening and closing &lt;html&gt; tag. This will also make your preview of your website update automatically if there are no issues with your code! <br> <br>\r\n \r\nWrap all the content of the file in an HTML element using the &lt;html&gt; tag.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n# Doctype and HTML tag\r\n\r\nThis is your Recipe page from the last lesson. Update it with elements that alert your browser which language the document was written in by adding DOCTYPE and &lt;html&gt; elements.\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/f75e718b8e40870e7b6d87c0efdfc0ae-image-1481320053480.png)",
