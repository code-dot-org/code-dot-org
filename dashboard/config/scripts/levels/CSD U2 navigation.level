To add navigation to your website you will need to add hyperlinks which connect your individual web pages. You can **add hyperlinks to your web page using the `<a>` element**.  The text you want to display as the hyperlink goes between the opening and closing hyperlink tags. The `<a>` element has an attribute `href` which is the location to link to.  The location of a local page is just the file path for that page. <br> <br>\r\n\r\nFor example to link to the unique houses page you would add the following code inside your `<body>` element. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n&lt;a href=”houses.html”&gt; Unique Houses &lt;/a&gt;\r\n</pre>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>\n\n**How do I add a hyperlink?**\n\n</summary>\n\nYou can **add hyperlinks to your web page using the `<a>` element**.

You'll be linking the two pages by creating a **navigation bar** at the top of the page.  Websites usually have the same navigation bar across all of their pages so you can get back and forth between things on the site.  You can see an example of a navigation bar on <a href=\"https://studio.code.org/projects/weblab/2KO4FIjN89QPeYnTG_NzLIjroaG8daOY3jRl5uHm1Co/\" target=\"_new\">this page</a>\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n* In your home page (index.html), add two hyperlinks at the top of the page, one to your lists page, and one to the home page.\r\n  * *Even though it might seem strange to link a page to itself, it's less confusing if the navigation bar is exactly the same on every page.*\r\n* Copy the code for the navigation bar, then add it to the top of your lists page.\r\n* Test your links in the preview area by clicking on them.\r\n",
