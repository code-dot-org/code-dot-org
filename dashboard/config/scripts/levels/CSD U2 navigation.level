Websites usually have the same navigation bar across all of their pages so you can get back and forth between things on the site.  You can see an example of a navigation bar on <a href=\"https://studio.code.org/projects/weblab/2KO4FIjN89QPeYnTG_NzLIjroaG8daOY3jRl5uHm1Co/\" target=\"_new\">this page</a>\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n* In your home page (index.html), add two hyperlinks at the top of the page, one to your lists page, and one to the home page.\r\n * *Even though it might seem strange to link a page to itself, it's less confusing if the navigation bar is exactly the same on every page.*\r\n* Copy the code for the navigation bar, then add it to the top of your lists page.\r\n* Test your links in the preview area by clicking on them.\r\n\r\n",
