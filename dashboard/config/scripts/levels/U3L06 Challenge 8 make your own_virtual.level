As we've already seen with our exploration of functions you can combine these commands to create more complex functionality, but at the lowest level all of your code will be making use of the set of commands provided by App Lab.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/7648c5293d04a57e4f715b5c08899ff9-image-1441996324573.png\" style=\"height: 250px; float: left; margin: 10px\">\r\n\r\nCode you write will always be based upon the commands that are provided by the programming language you are using. When several commands are provided in a logical chunk, like the set of turtle commands, we refer to them collectively as a **library** of functions. The total set of commands that a language provides access to is called the **application program interface**, or simply an **API**. \r\n\r\nAs you gain more experience you will gain familiarity with the API for the language you are using, but you will still want to return to the **API documentation** from time to time to remind yourself what functionality a language offers.\r\n\r\nCongratulations, you've really come a long way as a turtle artist! \r\n\r\n# Do This:\r\n\r\n**Draw whatever you like!**  The only requirements are:\r\n\r\n* use at least 3 different colors\r\n* use moveTo\r\n\r\nExplore the documentation for any new commands you see and use your skills as both an artist and user of **API documentation** to **draw something of your own choosing.**\r\n\r\nIf in doubt: try to re-create \"I [heart] CS\" drawing shown here.",
