It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect. How would you describe the difference between computer science and coding? How would you explain sequencing and algorithms to your students? ",

    "long_instructions": "# Exploring Data in Unit 9, Lesson 1\r\n\r\n**Goal:** The purpose of this section is to familiarize yourself with the content of U9L1 - Learning From Data and familiarize yourself with the New York Times resource used in the lesson, \"Over 60 New York Times Graphs for Students to Analyze\". *(Estimated time: ~20 minutes)*\r\n\r\nThis tool is only used in the first lesson in Unit 9, however it can set a creative and exploratory tone for the unit overall. \r\n\r\n## Do this:\r\n* Read the <a href=\"https://studio.code.org/s/csp9-2022/lessons/1\" target=\"blank\">U9L1 lesson plan</a>.\r\n* Find your own chart to explore from <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/learning/over-60-new-york-times-graphs-for-students-to-analyze.html\" target=\"blank\">the New York Times</a>. \r\n\r\n\t* **Consider “What” your chart shows.**  For example, what peaks and valleys are you seeing in the chart?   A description of your data is a **fact**. \r\n    * **Consider “Why” that might be the case.**  What kind of story can you derive from the description of your data?  This story about the reasons for why this data shows what it shows is an **opinion**.  Helping students differentiate between “fact” and “opinion” is a good lifelong skill to reinforce for students in U9L1 - Learning from Data. \r\n\r\n## Good background information to have:\r\nA big takeaway from U9L1 is that “correlation does not equal causation”.  A classic example of this is ice cream sales and shark attacks.  When ice cream sales go up, reports of shark attacks also increase, which could cause one to believe that “ice cream causes sharks to attack”.  However, warm weather may also cause more people to purchase ice cream and warm weather may also result in more people visiting the ocean which could also be a cause for the increase in shark attacks.  \r\n\r\nYou can read more about this and other misconceptions around correlation in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOB6vcwFL-I\" target=\"blank\">this episode of Dr. Data</a>. (Note: this video is not included in the lesson plan and is an optional part of this level.  Please only watch it if you are interested in developing your own understanding of this topic in particular.) \r\n\r\n## Reflect: \r\n* Describe the different features you explored on the New York Times site.\r\n* Which features do you want to model with your students before they start creating their own chart?  Which features will they find most interesting?  \r\n\t* Consider: looking at different time frames, geography considerations, comparing two or more search terms, etc.\r\n",
