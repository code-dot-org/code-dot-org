If you want to do something different from your sketch that is fine. Don't worry if there are things you still can't implement.\r\n\r\n**Transition:** Code Studio levels.\r\n\r\n**Circulate:** Students will be working to try to implement any part of their home page that they can on their own. If students are frustrated because they canâ€™t make something remind them we are going to be working on it later today and they should just do their best.  Students don't need to have a perfect page yet but give them time to add content and style.",
