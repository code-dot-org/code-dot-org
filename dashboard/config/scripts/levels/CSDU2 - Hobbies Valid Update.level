The  &lt;html&gt; tag is the container for all other HTML elements (The &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; tag does NOT go inside the html element).  You will need an opening and closing &lt;html&gt; tag. This will also make your preview of your website update automatically if there are no issues with your code! <br> <br>\r\n \r\nWrap all the content of the file in an HTML element using the &lt;html&gt; tag.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>**Why do I need to structure the HTML document this way?**</summary>\r\nAlthough many modern web browsers can make good assumptions about what language you are writing in and where to find different information in your document, you don't want to leave the display of you web page up to chance. To guarantee the best results for displaying your web page on all computers you need to assist the computer in figuring out where to find information. <br> <br>\r\n\r\nAs you go forward you are going to need two different sections in your HTML file. They will serve different purposes.\r\n<br><br>\r\n1. Content of the page<br>\r\n2. Information about the page<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy breaking up a web page this way it is clear where to find the code that is creating the physical output on the web page and which code is just information for the computer about the page.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn creating web pages we differentiate between these two areas using the &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; elements. The &lt;head&gt; element contains all the information about the page.  The &lt;body&gt; element contains all the content for a web page.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>**What is a head element?**</summary>\r\nThe &lt;head&gt; element contains all the information about the page. This is extra information that is helpful for the computer in displaying your web page but is not the physical content of the web page. \r\n\r\nThe &lt;head&gt; element usually comes above the body element but inside the &lt;html&gt; element. For right now it will be blank but later we will learn important things that are added to the head.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>**How is the head element different than the header elements? **</summary>\r\nThe header elements (&lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;) are used to display headers directly on your web page for your user to see. The head tag marks the information that is not user facing in your HTML document. \r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>**What is the body element? **</summary>\r\n\r\n The &lt;body&gt; element contains all the content for a web page.  The HTML elements for your headers, paragraphs, and lists should all go inside the &lt;body&gt; element.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n# Update Hobbies Page\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;, &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, and &lt;body&gt; are important to add to your web page. Practice adding them to update your Hobbies page. In all future levels they will be included for you so you won't need to add themselves.",
