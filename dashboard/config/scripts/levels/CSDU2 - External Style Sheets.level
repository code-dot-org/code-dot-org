This is a simple template page that contains the features your website might contain. You will use this page to play around with the style rules until you find the right set of style rules for your brand. These style rules will be common across all the pages on your website. They will promote your own personal brand. Since they will be common across all the web pages it would be nice if they could all be written in one place instead of duplicating them on every page.\r\n\r\nYou can get clearer separation of content and style by putting content and style in separate files. The new file for CSS will be called an **external style sheet**. Most of the time the file name will be **style.css**. Since the file ends in .css the web browswer already knows that this is CSS code so we no longer need the `<style>` element around it. \r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\n* Add a new CSS file called style.css\r\n* Copy all the CSS from inside the `<style>` element from the .html file to the .css file\r\n* Delete the `<style>` element from the .html file",
