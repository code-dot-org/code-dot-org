In order to do this we'll need to change our looping condition to use the variables we've been using to count our streak of heads. To begin with **your simulation should look for a streak of 3 heads** so that you can still visually confirm the output.\r\n\r\n# Do This:\r\n\r\n* **Change the condition** used by your `while` loop so that it now runs **while the streak of heads is less than 3**.\r\n* **Test your program** by running it and visually confirming that its output is correct. It should run like in the example below.\r\n* **Note:** As before it's possible that your output will sometimes run off the screen. You can still confirm your code is working as you intend (it should never run after a streak of 3) and we will address this issue in the next exercise.\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/90ec4022f784ba136e59bb9b7c57a5c7-image-1446862623863.gif)",
