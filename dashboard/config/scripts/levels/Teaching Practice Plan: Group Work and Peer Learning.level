If you haven’t already reviewed the materials, do that now and come back to this task later.**\r\n\r\n\r\n# Teaching Practice Plan: Group Work and Peer Learning\r\n\r\nFor this task, you’re going to develop and submit a Teaching Practice Plan, which details your plan for supporting group work throughout unit 1. Your plan should address the following things: \r\n\r\n- What is your plan for supporting students who are struggling to engage in group work, either because they prefer to work alone, or because they are having issues collaborating with their partner(s)? \r\n- How do you plan to help make sure all members of the team have a voice in their groups’ discussions?\r\n- How can you help students understand and appreciate the importance of learning through and from one another? \r\n\r\nYou can type out your teaching practice plan in the box below, or you can upload a word doc or pdf file. \r\n\r\n## Getting Credit for Completing this Task\r\n\r\n#### Task Review Details\r\n\r\nIf this module is listed as  your “focus area”, then your response to the prompt above will be shared anonymously and reviewed by your peers, and you will review the work done by other teachers. Reviewers will be looking for thoughtful and thorough answers that demonstrate that you have spent time considering how this practice will fit into your own classroom. Reviewers will have an opportunity to give feedback on your submission, and you can respond to that feedback and resubmit. \r\n\r\nIn order to get credit for completing this task, two reviewers need to agree that you have responded to the prompts fully. If reviewers don’t feel comfortable making a decision about your task submission, they can elevate to a facilitator to review. You will always have a chance to address feedback from your reviewers and resubmit your task! Reviewer feedback will show up at the bottom of this page, once it’s available. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
