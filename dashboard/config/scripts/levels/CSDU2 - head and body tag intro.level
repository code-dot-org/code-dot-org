To guarantee the best results for displaying your web page on all computers you need to assist the computer in figuring out where to find information. <br> <br>\r\n\r\nAs you go forward you are going to need two different sections in your HTML file. They will serve different purposes.\r\n<br><br>\r\n1. Content of the page<br>\r\n2. Information about the page<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy breaking up a web page this way it is clear where to find the code that is creating the physical output on the web page and which code is just information for the computer about the page.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn creating web pages we differentiate between these two areas using the &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; elements. The &lt;head&gt; element contains all the information about the page.  The &lt;body&gt; element contains all the content for a web page.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>**What is a head element?**</summary>\r\nThe &lt;head&gt; element contains all the information about the page. This is extra information that is helpful for the computer in displaying your web page but is not the physical content of the web page. \r\n\r\nThe &lt;head&gt; element usually comes above the body element but inside the &lt;html&gt; element. For right now it will be blank but later we will learn important things that are added to the head.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>**How is the head element different than the header elements? **</summary>\r\nThe header elements (&lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;) are used to display headers directly on your web page for your user to see. The head tag marks the information that is not user facing in your HTML document. \r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>**What is the body element? **</summary>\r\n\r\n The &lt;body&gt; element contains all the content for a web page.  The HTML elements for your headers, paragraphs, and lists should all go inside the &lt;body&gt; element.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n# Head and Body\r\n\r\nFormat your HTML document with two sections using the &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; elements as shown in the image below. From this point forward anything you add to an HTML document should go inside either the &lt;head&gt; or the &lt;body&gt; elements. Put all the content and structure you have created so far inside the &lt;body&gt; element.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/2513d8f7c31e76c2ee5427e512a54a1c-image-1481559174341.png\" style=\"width:300px\">",
