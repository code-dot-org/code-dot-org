Dogs are super fun to play with. I have a dog named Bruce that my family has had for ten years. I have a lot of experience taking care of dogs. Read for more information about taking care of dogs.\\n    <h3>Excercise</h3><p>\\n      Some dogs need lots of excercise or else they might chew up your furniture because they are bored. Other dogs do not need much excercise at all. It's a good idea to take your dog for at least one walk a day so that they can excercise. That way they can be happy and healthy.</p>\\n    <h3>Feeding Your Dog</h3><p> \\n      Dogs need food at least twice a day. You can buy their food at a pet store. BUT DO NOT GIVE YOUR DOG BAD FOODS! Like grapes, chocolate and onions. They can be very dangerous!</p> \\n    <h3>Training Your Dogs</h3><p>\\n      They say You Can't Teach An Old Dog New Tricks. But I think that's wrong! All dogs can learn tricks. Some tricks that you might want to teach your dog are\\n      <br> Sit\\n      <br> Down\\n      <br> Stay\\n      <br> Rollover\\n      <br>And many more!</p> \\n  </body>\\n</html>\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"style.css\",\r\n      \"data\": \"body {\\n  background: blue;\\n}\\n\\nh1 {\\n  color: darkblue;\\n  text-align: center;\\n  text-shadow: -2px 2px black;\\n}\\n\\nh2 {\\n  color:mediumblue;\\n  text-align: center;\\n}\\n\\nh3 {\\n  color:mediumblue;\\n  text-align:left; \\n}\\n\\np {\\n  font-size: 14px;\\n  text-align: left;\\n}\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n            "
