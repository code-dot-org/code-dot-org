    "teacher_markdown": "Student answers will vary. Students should recognize that there are many ways to represent information in Java. The best data type is based on how it is used in the program and the possible values the variable will store.\r\n\r\n**Sample Responses:**\r\n\r\n1. Population of a country: The population of a country should be represented as an integer. Each person in the population is represented as a whole number because you can not have a fraction of a person.\r\n\r\n2. Shoe size: Shoe size should be represented as a double because there are shoe-size systems that include half size. Therefore, a decimal is needed to represent the half sizes.\r\n\r\n3. Phone number: A phone number should be represented as a String. While a phone number may appear to be an integer, phone numbers are a string of numbers that are not used for calculations.",
