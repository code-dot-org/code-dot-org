We can change that!\r\n\r\n# App Lab's Data Tools\r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/5d596107387e3edcb35aa3d317b0e9f5-image-1448992686641.46.54 PM.png\" style=\"width: 100px; float: right\"> App Lab has a set of commands for storing data permanently in a database! You can write code to save data and then retrieve it later, even if the app has been stopped and re-started. All together we call this set of commands **App Lab's Data Tools**, and they have their own toolbox category called \"Data\".\r\n\r\n\"What's a database? Where is it? How do I use it?\" It's easier to show you these things than explain it all at once.  So let's get started, and we'll explain everything you need to know along the way.\r\n\r\n# Do This:\r\n\r\n* **Drag out the `createRecord` command**. It has some default code provided.\r\n* **Run the program**. After a brief pause, you should see the message in the console: **\"Success! Created record.\"**\r\n* **What happened? What was created? Where is it?** After you've seen the \"success\" message, click finish to move to the next level.  We'll explain there.\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/fa1c0d6f399ba181d4179838205b93e3-image-1449164742176.gif)",
