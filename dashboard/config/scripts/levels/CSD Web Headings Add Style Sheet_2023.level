Some are colorful, some smell good, some are poisonous, and others do not even need soil to grow! Here is information for three different flowers.<\\/h5>\\r\\n    <h2>Rose<\\/h2>\\r\\n    <p>Roses naturally grow in several colors, and people often use the colors to symbolize things. For example, red roses represent love, and yellow roses are used to show friendship. There are rose gardens around the world, and the largest ones have hundreds of rose varieties and thousands of rose bushes.<\\/p>\\r\\n    <h2>Hibiscus<\\/h2>\\r\\n    <p>There are over 300 species of hibiscus plants.
