There are lots of options to choose from, and you can always return to this screen and select a different one if you'd like. **Do This:** Find a dataset you like and click on it to select it.

Use the cross-tab table to help decide if this would be a useful feature or not. Remember to pay attention to hot spots in the data. **Do This:** Decide if you would like to use this column as a feature. If so, press the \"Add Feature\" button. If not, select a new column to explore. Once you've selected your features, press the \"Train\" button\r\n\r\n- _The instructions for the **Results** screen say:_ Check the accuracy of your model, and test out some new toppings to see if the predictions match what you expected from the survey data. When AI Bot decides \"Like\" or \"Dislike\", it's really letting you know how the people _in the survey_ would feel about that particular food. **Do This:** Try to get a model that is at least 80% accurate. You can press the \"Try Again\" button to go back and select new features for your model\r\n\r\n\t- _The instructions when you click the details panel say:_ Check the accuracy of your model, and test out some new toppings to see if the predictions match what you expected from the survey data.
