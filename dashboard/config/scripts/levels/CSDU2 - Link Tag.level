You may have noticed though that the style was no longer appearing on the page. To get the style to apply to the web page we need to connect the html and css files.\r\n\r\n**To link sheets you will need to add a `<link>` element.** The `<link>` element goes inside the `<head>` element since it is information about the page and not content of the page. You can link a stylesheet to multiple pages if you want them all to have the same style.\r\n\r\n`<link>` element has two main attributes: `rel` and `href`.\r\n\r\n* As you learned before for images the `href` attribute is the file path, in this case just the same of the CSS file.  \r\n* The `rel` attribute indicates the relationship that the linked file has to the current file, in this case its a stylesheet.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n<pre>\r\n&lt;head&gt;\r\n    &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\"&gt;\r\n&lt;/head&gt;\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\n* For the index.html link the css file using the `<link>` element in the `<head>` element",
