The AP Create Peformance task asks you to write about your development process when writing code.  \r\n\r\nLet's take a minute to understand this writing prompt and how it is scored. Here is the actual writing prompt **2b** from the AP Create Task guidelines:\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width: 70%; margin: auto; font-family: serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3; background-color: #EEEEEE; padding: 10px\">\r\n\r\n<b>2b.</b> Describe the incremental and iterative development process of your program, focusing on two distinct points in that process. Describe the difficulties and/or opportunities you encountered and how they were resolved or incorporated. In your description clearly indicate whether the development described was collaborative or independent. At least one of these points must refer to independent program development. <i>(Must not exceed 200 words)</i>\r\n</div>\r\n<br>\r\nYour response to this prompt can get up to 2 points, and is scored looking at two major things:\r\n\r\n1. (1 point) Do you describe a real *iterative* process for writing the *whole* program - \"Incremental and iterative\" means that you continuously improved your program based on testing, reflection, or feedback from a partner.\r\n\r\n2. (1 point) Do you actually describe *two* points in time while writing your code, what the specific issue was, and how you got past it by *reflecting* or *incorporating feedback* from a collaborative partner.\r\n\r\nHere are the actual scoring guidelines:\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/1cb4a1840d281a9c5c5096becc8c9054-image-1507827422107.png)\r\n\r\n## Now you try it\r\n\r\nTry to write a response to this AP Prompt thinking about either how you developed the idea for the snowflake drawing program, or how you resolved to make the 3x3 grid program.  You might have to use a little bit of imagination to assume that it's part of a larger program you created yourself.  The point is to *practice writing* about your development process.",
