With your partner, consider:\r\n\r\n- How have people wearing teacher hats been balancing their time leading or guiding with the student-hat’s time to get into activities and tools?\r\n- What strategies have been effective for managing the transition to tools? What strategies are effective in getting peoples’ attention once they’re lost in a tool?\r\n- What are your  current thoughts about the appropriate balance of teacher-guided time VS time in the tools or with the activities?\r\n\r\nUse the space below to record any thoughts, recommendations, or commentary.",
