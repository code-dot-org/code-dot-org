The `class=winter` inside the opening tag adds everything inside the tag to the class.\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>**Why does the selector have a period in front of it?**</summary>\r\nIn CSS, a period in front of a selector means that the selector is the name of a class.  If there is no period, it means that the selector is the name of an HTML tag.\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>**Why would a web developer use classes?**</summary>\r\nA web developer uses classes when some elements should be styled differently than others, even if they are the same tag.  Classes can also be used to give elements that have different tags the same style.\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>**I got different RGB values, but mine are right, too.**</summary>\r\nBecause RGB creates millions of different colors, some are so similar that people have a hard time telling them apart.  That means that there are multiple RGB values that are close enough to work for our winter color.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n</div>\r\n# Classes\r\n\r\nIn this page, the web developer has used classes to give some of the words our winter color.\r\n\r\n* Look at the HTML code for the winter words.  Why is \"snowy\" the only winter word without the winter color?\r\n* Add code to the HTML that will give \"snowy\" the same winter blue as the other words.\r\n* Look inside the style sheet to find the rule that makes all the words in the winter class blue, and check whether your RGB numbers are close to the ones in the style sheet.  \r\n* Discuss with your partner how the code works.",
