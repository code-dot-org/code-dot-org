For example, if the four plays of the game that are simulated as a result of the method call `playManyTimes(4)` earn scores of `75`, `50`, `90`, and `20`, then the method should return `90`. \r\n\r\nPlay of the game is simulated by calling the helper method `play`. Note that if `play` is called only one time followed by multiple consecutive calls to `getScore`, each call to `getScore` will return the score earned in the single simulated play of the game. \r\n\r\nComplete the `playManyTimes` method. Assume that `getScore` works as intended, regardless of what you wrote in part (a). You must call `play` and `getScore` appropriately in order to receive full credit.\r\n",
