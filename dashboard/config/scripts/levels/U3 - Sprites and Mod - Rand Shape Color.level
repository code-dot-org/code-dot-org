    "markdown_instructions": "# Properties\r\n\r\nIn past levels you created rectangles and then made a bunch of variables to keep track of different qualities about that rectangles such as its position and color. Sprites take away the need to make lots of separate variables because those qualities can be controlled by built in properties. Properties are pre-defined variables associated with a sprite that allow you to control an element of a sprite such as its color. \r\n\r\nThe first sprite property you are going to use is `shapeColor`. `shapeColor` manages the color of the rectangle sprite. To access properties programmers use something called dot notation.  Dot notation points out the sprite and then the aspect of that sprite you are interested in. You need both because all sprites will have a `shapeColor` property so without the name of the sprite the computer doesn't know which sprite to change the color of.\r\nDot notation looks like <img src=\"\" style=\"width:100\">.\r\n\r\nProperties can be used to both get and set the value. In fact when you pull out a property block it will adapt to the place you put it. For now just worry about setting the property to a new value which looks like <img src=\"\" style=\"width:100\">. Just like variables, properties can also be updated repeatedly inside the draw loop to produce an animation. \r\n\r\nOne major difference you will notice from setting the color of a rectangle to setting the color of the sprite is that we set of the color of the sprite **after** we make the sprite. This is because properties of a sprite are created when the sprite is created.\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\nThe shape color of the first sprite is set for you. Can you set the color of the second sprite?\r\n\r\n* Add a command to set the `shapeColor` of the second sprite\r\n* Run the program and test it out.",
