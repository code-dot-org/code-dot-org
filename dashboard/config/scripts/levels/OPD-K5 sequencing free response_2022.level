It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect.

The \"driver\" writes code while the \"navigator\" directs the design and setup of the code.  The two programmers switch roles often.  \r\n\r\n**Sequencing** describes the process of ordering steps in a linear manner.\r\n\r\n**Algorithms** are lists of steps to complete a task. Programs are algorithms written as code for a computer to execute.\r\n",
