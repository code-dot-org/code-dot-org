You will write two methods in the `WordMatch` class. \r\n\r\n<br>\r\nWrite the `WordMatch` method `scoreGuess`. To determine the score to be returned, `scoreGuess` finds the number of times that `guess` occurs as a substring of `secret` and then multiplies that number by the square of the length of `guess`. Occurrences of `guess` may overlap within `secret`. \r\n\r\nAssume that the length of `guess` is less than or equal to the length of `secret` and that `guess` is not an empty string. \r\n\r\nThe following examples show declarations of a `WordMatch` object. The tables show the outcomes of some possible calls to the `scoreGuess` method.\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/5dd06cf731abecdd3080cba8a836e023-image-1687368439194.27.14 PM.png)\r\n\r\nComplete the `scoreGuess` method\r\n",
