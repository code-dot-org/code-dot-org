Pay attention to:\r\n\r\n- How the ciphertext is being produced\r\n- What happens when you get to the last character of the key\r\n- After you’ve stepped through a few characters click Play to watch the rest animate\r\n- Hit Restart and play the animation again. You can use the speed slider to speed it up or slow it down  \r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/06858f88ac12997bba73f4f76638a068-image-1443574425185.gif)\r\n\r\n### Decrypt a message\r\nEncrypt a message as above, then:  \r\n\r\n- Highlight and copy the ciphertext\r\n- Paste it into the plaintext area. Note: Don’t change the key\r\n- Change the Encrypt/Decrypt toggle to Decrypt\r\n- Hit Step a few times, and then Play\r\n\r\nYou should see the original text emerge.  \r\n![](https://images.code.org/dc89d6c19c17adb23b6b5ff9a62c4583-image-1443574425182.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\nHow hard would it be to crack a message encrypted with this cipher? Does the length of the key make a difference?",
