We slowly build confidence and skills throughout the year.  We do this by providing frequent check-ins during FRQ days in class to make sure students have the support they need to read and make sense of FRQ questions prior to developing their answers.  Since Unit 5 is approximately half way through the course, now is a good point in the year to reflect on how FRQ days have gone so far. \r\n \r\n## Reflect:\r\nConsider the last FRQ day you did with students. \r\n\r\n* What strengths and skills have you seen your students demonstrate during FRQ days?\r\n* What skills do you still need to work on with students?\r\n* What FRQ strategies do you want to try reviewing with students?\r\n",
