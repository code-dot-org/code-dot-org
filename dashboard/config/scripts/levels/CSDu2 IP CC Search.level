The Creative Commons search page (linked below) is a compilation of CC friendly search engines that you can use to find media for your page.\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\nUsing the Creative Commons Search page, find a handful of pictures that you'll want to use on your web pages. By default the search is set to the most restrictive settings. Next to the the text **I want something that I can...** you can uncheck _use for commercial purposes_. You can also uncheck _modify, adapt, or build upon_ as long as you don't plan on modifying the images you find (such as adding text, cropping, or otherwise editing).\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/41b70c9ad055b42ed9d9749be2e1fdb2-image-1473978771297.31.58.png\" style=\"max-width: 800px\"/>\r\n\r\nFor each image you plan on using:\r\n\r\n* Download a copy to your computer (so that you can upload it to your website in the next step)\r\n* Write down all information you can find about the author, such as\r\n\t* Name, or screenname\r\n    * URL of website (not URL of the image itself)\r\n    * Title of image\r\n",
