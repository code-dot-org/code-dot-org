It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect.

Note: we will be focusing more about the Create Performance Task in Module 8. \r\n* Since Unit 6 should be your first unit in semester 2, Unit 7 is approximately 1 week into your second semester.\r\n\r\n## Do this: \r\n* Read the information found on the <a href=\"https://curriculum.code.org/csp-20/unit7/\" target=\"blank\">Unit 7 landing page. overview</a> \r\n\r\n## Reflect: \r\nBased on what you read in the Unit 7 landing page, how does the content and structure of this unit help students prepare for the Create Performance Task?\r\n\r\n",
