Within a problem solving context, computers are designed to solve information problems.  Subtleties may come up in the discussion around computers that have output mechanisms that allow them to do physical work (e.g. robots).  It's okay if students do not come to a particular conclusion about every device they can think of.\r\n\r\nStudents may not have had time to sufficiently reflect on the nature of input, output, storage, and processing, so their answers here may be vague, especially around processing.  They will be able to dig into these concepts more later in the unit.  Focus on input and output for now, and allow students to disagree on particulars of storage and processing, letting them know that they will have more opportunities to explore the subject.   For example, one common source of controversy around processing is whether some devices are processing information themselves, or whether the user is processing the information, while the device simply stores information (e.g. the abacus)."
