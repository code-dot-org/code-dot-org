These fonts however are unique to the brand and will need to adventure beyond the 5 font families you have been using.\r\n\r\nPicking a small set of fonts for your website is also a good practice as when you adventure beyond the 5 font families into other fonts the browser has to download the font file. Downloading files is something that can add time to how long it takes to your load your website. To prevent it from taking too long it is good to stay with just 2 different fonts.\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\n* Go to the <a href=\"http://fontpair.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Font Pair </a> website. The website lists sets of heading and body font pairs that work nicely together. Each pair is listed like the image below.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/7f34c1986c16fbb50e2acc4f72923b60-image-1475593488897.03.00 AM.png\" style=\"width:400px\">\r\n\r\n* Pick a font set you like.\r\n* Copy the heading and body font names.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/879b3b41486f728fbb8840469277704e-image-1475594076521.png\" style=\"width:400px\">\r\n\r\n* Click the link to each font. This should take you to a google fonts page.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/6163e64372d8825a7a8ed6a943cb3701-image-1475594076522.png\" style=\"width:400px\">\r\n\r\n* Copy the URL for the google fonts page into the box below so they will be saved for later. An example is below.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/92e66b9ffae4d836175d63d87ab5586c-image-1475594389964.17.58 AM.png\" style=\"width:400px\">",
