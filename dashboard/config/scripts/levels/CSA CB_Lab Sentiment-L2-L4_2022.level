Explain how the `totalSentiment` method works, including how youâ€™re using strings and iteration in your solution.\r\n\r\n5. Test your `starRating method` for multiple reviews, including your simple sample review.\r\n\r\n**a.** Do the ratings make sense? Explain why or why not.\r\n\r\n**b.** Describe at least two ways in which you could adjust your `totalSentiment` method so that your program returns even more reasonable ratings.\r\n\r\n6. A student is writing a `starRating` method based on his `totalSentiment` method, which calculates the sum of all of the sentiment values in a review. He comes up with the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic static int starRating(String fileName)\r\n{\r\n\tdouble totalSentiment = totalSentiment(fileName);\r\n\tif(totalSentiment < 15)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\treturn 4;\r\n\t}\r\n\telse if(totalSentiment < 10)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\treturn 3;\r\n\t}\r\n\telse if(totalSentiment < 5)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\treturn 2;\r\n\t}\r\n\telse if(totalSentiment < 0)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\treturn 1;\r\n\t}\r\n\telse\r\n\t{\r\n\t\treturn 0;\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nExplain to the student, using **specific examples** of (a) what **logical error** he made in writing his code, and (b) how to **fix** it.",
