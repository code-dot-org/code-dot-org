It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect.

    "long_instructions": "# Analyzing the Scoring Guidelines\r\n\r\nFrequently teachers teaching CSA as an AP course have AP scores on the top of their minds.  While there are many reasons students might take an AP course that are not related to AP scores, it can be worthwhile to consider how students can maximize their score using testing strategies.  Let’s pause to consider how students can earn points on an FRQ even if the solution isn't entirely correct. \r\n\r\nAs teachers look at the rubrics for FRQ questions, they typically notice that there are a few “easy” points for students to get on an FRQ.  For example, the Scoring Guidelines for 2018 Question 4, allows students to earn a point if they construct an array that is the right size.  Everything else could be incorrect, but if they can make an array that is the right size, they earn a point. \r\n\r\n## Do this:\r\n\r\n* Review the Scoring Guidelines with the lens of looking for \"easy\" points. What are some easy ways a student could earn 1-2 points on the FRQ without answering the entire question very accurately?\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n**Up next:** We will look at additional resources from the College Board to help you and your students understand how the Scoring Guidelines are applied to responses. \r\n",
