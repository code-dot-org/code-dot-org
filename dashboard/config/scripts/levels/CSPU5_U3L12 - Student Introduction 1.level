Sequential programs are predictable; they start at a beginning point and progress to the end point in a way that can be perfectly predicted when the program begins running. Event-driven programs do not progress in a predictable order. Events outside of the program (e.g. mouse clicks and key presses) control the execution of the program, a feature which makes these programs dynamic but also leads to unpredictable program execution and an associated set of challenges.\n\n## Vocabulary\n\n* **Event-driven program**:  a program designed to run blocks of code or functions in response to specified events (e.g. a mouse click)\n\n## Lesson\n\n* Participate in an event-driven programming simulation using playing cards.\n* Examine the problems that can arise in event-driven programming.\n\n## Resources\n\n* Activity Guide: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yl75cgaL049yFDyiv5SPjwtckKWoqLQNQeNAiPzxSMs/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">Events Unplugged</a>\n\n<a class=\"btn btn-large btn-primary next-stage submitButton\">Continue</a>\n"
