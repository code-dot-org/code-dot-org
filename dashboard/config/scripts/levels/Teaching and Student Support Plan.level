If you haven’t already reviewed the materials, do that now and come back to this task later.**\r\n\r\n# Teaching and Student Support plan\r\n## Task Description\r\n\r\nNow that you have a better sense of this lesson, let’s think about the types of supports students will need in order to successfully complete it. Since the curriculum is based on inquiry learning, lessons feature activities that engage students in discovering core concepts themselves. It’s important to think through implementation plans and student support. In this task you will make a plan for teaching and student support that takes into account differentiation strategies and make-up work for absent students. Your teaching and student support plan should cover the following: \r\n\r\n- **Details on how you will implement and differentiate the lesson:**\r\n\r\n  - An outline of any changes you will need to make to the lesson to fit your local constraints or context (for example: pacing and time, dealing with classroom setup, etc). \r\n  - An overview of the types of student needs you’ll likely need to support in your classroom (for example: students who are struggling to understand the underlying concept; students who are already familiar with the concept, but still have room to learn more; etc)\r\n  - Your plan for addressing each of the needs outlined above (for example: integrating extension activities or other materials for students who already know something about the topic)\r\n<br><Br>\r\n\r\n- **Plan for catching up absent students:**\r\n\r\n  - How will absent students catch up on activities they missed? \r\n\r\nYou can type out your teaching and student support plan in the box below, or you can upload a word doc or pdf file. \r\n\r\n## Getting Credit for Completing this Task\r\n\r\n#### Task Review Details\r\n\r\nIf this module is listed as  your “focus area”, then your response to the prompt above will be shared anonymously and reviewed by your peers, and you will review the work done by other teachers. Reviewers will be looking for thoughtful and thorough answers that demonstrate that you have spent time considering how the lesson will play out in your own classroom. Reviewers will have an opportunity to give feedback on your submission, and you can respond to that feedback and resubmit. \r\n\r\nIn order to get credit for completing this task, two reviewers need to agree that you have responded to the prompts fully. If reviewers don’t feel comfortable making a decision about your task submission, they can elevate to a facilitator to review. You will always have a chance to address feedback from your reviewers and resubmit your task! Reviewer feedback will show up at the bottom of this page, once it’s available. ",
