If not, keep on researching! Otherwise it's time to start structuring the content of your page.\r\n\r\nFor all of the content you find externally, you'll need to provide attribution to the original creator. For now, just include the url of the site where you found it in parenthesis. For example\r\n\r\n* According to the ASPCA only 10% of animals entering shelters have been spayed or neutered (http://www.aspca.org/animal-homelessness).\r\n* Kill shelters euthanize 2.7 million animals per year (http://www.aspca.org/animal-homelessness).\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\nThe specifics of your page layout will depend on your topics and goals, but in general you should create the following structure\r\n\r\n* A first level header with a catchy title for your page\r\n* A second level header for each separate argument to support your cause\r\n* Paragraphs of content under each second level header\r\n* The urls of any sites where you found information\r\n* Don't worry about styling right now you are just getting the content\r\n",
