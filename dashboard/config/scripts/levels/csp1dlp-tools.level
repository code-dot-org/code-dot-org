If you haven’t already reviewed the materials, do that now and come back to this reflection later.**\r\n\r\n\r\n# Unit 1 Tool Philosophy and Use\r\n\r\nFor this reflection, you’re going to consider each of the prompts below and craft a written response that demonstrates your understanding of the lessons in Unit 1. Your response should clearly address each of the items below: \r\n\r\n- Why are we using the Internet Simulator rather than teaching without it? \r\n- In what ways is the Internet Simulator educational rather than professional? \r\n- What’s the philosophy of teaching with the Internet Simulator? \r\n- This is a very Internet Simulator heavy unit. What are strategies for dealing with students who are getting fatigued by the end of the unit? \r\n- Many classes have technology issues at the start of the year (computers are not ready yet, etc). How would you recommend a teacher approaches the first unit if she’s having issues with technology access?\r\n\r\n\r\n>## Getting Credit for Completing this Reflection \r\n>\r\n>- Once you submit your reflection, your response to the prompt above will be shared anonymously and reviewed by your peers, and you will review the work done by other facilitators. Reviewers will be looking for thoughtful and thorough answers that demonstrate that you have spent time considering the reflection questions listed above. Reviewers will have an opportunity to give feedback on your submission, and you can respond to that feedback and resubmit.\r\n>- In order to get credit for completing this prompt, two reviewers need to agree that you have responded to the prompts fully. If reviewers don’t feel comfortable making a decision about your task submission, they can elevate to an instructor for review. You will always have a chance to address feedback from your reviewers and resubmit your reflections! Reviewer feedback will show up at the bottom of this page, once it’s available. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n",
