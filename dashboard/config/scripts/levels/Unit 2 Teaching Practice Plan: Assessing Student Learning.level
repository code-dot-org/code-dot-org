If you haven’t already reviewed the materials, do that now and come back to this task later.**\r\n\r\n# Unit 2 Teaching Practice Plan: Assessing Student Learning\r\n\r\nFor this task, you’re going to develop and submit a Teaching Practice Plan, which details your plan for assessing student learning throughout unit 2. Your plan should address the following: \r\n\r\n- Using what’s in the curriculum\r\n \r\n  - How do you plan to use the assessment opportunities that have been provided in the curriculum? Your response should include how you plan to use formative lessons questions (blue bubbles in code studio), project rubrics, AP-style questions (following lesson 6 and lesson 17), practice performance tasks (lessons 6 and 15)\r\n\r\n\r\n- Making your own assessments\r\n\r\n  - What types of assessments might you need to create or use on top of those provided in the curriculum? \r\n  - What is your strategy for developing assessment opportunities that are consistent with the philosophy of the curriculum and activities? \r\n\r\nYou can type out your teaching practice plan in the box below, or you can upload a word doc or pdf file. \r\n\r\n## Getting Credit for Completing this Task\r\n\r\n#### Task Review Details\r\n\r\nIf this module is listed as  your “focus area”, then your response to the prompt above will be shared anonymously and reviewed by your peers, and you will review the work done by other teachers. Reviewers will be looking for thoughtful and thorough answers that demonstrate that you have spent time considering how this practice will fit into your own classroom. Reviewers will have an opportunity to give feedback on your submission, and you can respond to that feedback and resubmit. \r\n\r\nIn order to get credit for completing this task, two reviewers need to agree that you have responded to the prompts fully. If reviewers don’t feel comfortable making a decision about your task submission, they can elevate to a facilitator to review. You will always have a chance to address feedback from your reviewers and resubmit your task! Reviewer feedback will show up at the bottom of this page, once it’s available. \r\n\r\n",
