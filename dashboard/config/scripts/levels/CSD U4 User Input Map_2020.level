If students are struggling with how programming works in App Lab, focus on these essentials:\r\n\r\n* There is no `draw` loop that runs forever\r\n* The `onEvent()` block specifies:\r\n\t* an element ID\r\n    * an event (such as \"click\" or \"mouseover\")\r\n    * code that should be run when the event occurs (this code is technically an anonymous callback function, represented by the green block)\r\n* Code inside `onEvent()` blocks runs any time the specified event occurs\r\n\r\n#### Compared to Game Lab\r\n\r\nIn Game Lab, we might use the following code to check if a sprite named \"button\" was clicked and do something about it:\r\n\r\n    function draw() {\r\n    \tif (mousePressedOver(button)) {\r\n       \t\t// Do something\r\n       \t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nIn App Lab, given a button with the ID \"button\", we could write the following code to achieve the same goal:\r\n\r\n\r\n    onEvent(\"button\", \"click\", function () {\r\n    \t// Do something\r\n    });\r\n\r\nIn the App Lab example, the function is just another argument passed to the onEvent function, it just so happens that the argument must be a function itself. We could also define the function separately and write this same program as follows:\r\n\r\n    function doSomething() {\r\n    \t// Do something\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    onEvent(\"button\", \"click\", doSomething);\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the second example, notice that when we pass the function `doSomething` to the `onEvent` function we _don't_ include the parenthesis at the end. This is because we're actually passing the whole function as an object.",
