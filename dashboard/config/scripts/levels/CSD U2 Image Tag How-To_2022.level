The attribute `src` stands for **s**ou**rc**e and tell the name of the image. Image files names include extensions which tell the computer which type of image they are working with. Common extensions are .jpg, .jpeg, .png. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to have the src attribute, image elements also have the `alt` attribute which describe the image. This is important in case the image doesnâ€™t load or for people who have trouble with their eyesight. \r\n\r\n\r\nAn `<img>` tag is an example of a  **self-closing tag** because it starts and closes in one tag.\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**Why does an image tag not have a closing tag?**]\r\nAn image tag doesn't need a closing tag because there is no text content which must be wrapped in tags. The content that shows on the screen is specified through the tags attributes.\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**What is an attribute?**]\r\n\r\nAttributes are extra information included in a tag.  Attributes have names and values. The name tells what type of information is being provided and then the value gives the specific information for that tag. \r\n\r\nFor example <img> tags have two attributes, src and alt. src specifies the name of the image file and alt tells the browser in readable text what the image is.\r\n\r\n\r\n:::\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n# Make a How-To Guide\r\n\r\nUse your new image skills to share another skill that you have.
