For example:\r\n- A man needed to go to the grocery store to buy some milk\r\n- Fortunately, he had a car that he could drive to the store\r\n- Unfortunately, the car was out of gas\r\n- Fortunately, there was a gas station nearby that he could walk to\r\n- Unfortunately, the path to the gas station went through the swamp that was infested with crocodiles\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\n1) Work with your partner to add alternating sentences to the story below. One person should add the \"fortunately\" sentences, and the other person should add the \"unfortunately\" sentences\r\n\t- Be sure to use `<p>` and `</p>` tags so each line of the story appears as a separate line\r\n- Repeat this until the story is at least 8 lines long",
