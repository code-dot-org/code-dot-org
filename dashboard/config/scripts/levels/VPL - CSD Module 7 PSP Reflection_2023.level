It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect.

In Unit 6, students use the process when **programming** the Circuit Playground. If you need a refresher on the Problem Solving Process, see page 40 in the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VUbXHxXqHj5QCb4eSb756KKc7NDzbOLZUE5bPPQmJR8/edit#heading=h.yzvzm69vybhk\\preview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Curriculum Guide </a>. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/09a4bce7db7bc095f011b8e3ab0f314b-image-1596498378646.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; height:30%; width:30%\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespond to the following questions:\r\n\r\n* Keeping in mind Unit 6 should be taught in-person with students, what challenges do you anticipate students will encounter during the “try” phase as they begin to use the Circuit Playground? \r\n* What support will you have in place in your classroom to help students during this time?\r\n\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12px;\">If more space is needed, click and drag the bottom-right corner to adjust the size of the text box.</span>\r\n\r\n",
