A partial declaration of the `Data` class is shown. You will write two methods of the `Data` class. \r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class Data \r\n{ \r\n\tpublic static final int MAX = /* value not shown */; \r\n    private int[][] grid; \r\n    \r\n    /** Fills all elements of grid with randomly generated values, as described in part (a) \r\n     * Precondition: grid is not null. \r\n     * grid has at least one element. \r\n     */ \r\n     public void repopulate() \r\n     { /* to be implemented in part (a) */ } \r\n     \r\n     /** Returns the number of columns in grid that are in increasing order, as described \r\n      * in part (b) \r\n      * Precondition: grid is not null. \r\n      * grid has at least one element. \r\n      */ \r\n      public int countIncreasingCols() \r\n      { /* to be implemented in part (b) */ } \r\n      \r\n      // There may be instance variables, constructors, and methods that are not shown. \r\n      \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n__Part A)__ Write the `repopulate` method, which assigns a newly generated random value to each element of `grid`. Each value is computed to meet all of the following criteria, and all valid values must have an equal chance of being generated. \r\n* The value is between 1 and `MAX`, inclusive. \r\n* The value is divisible by 10. \r\n* The value is not divisible by 100. \r\n\r\nComplete the `repopulate` method.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n__Part B)__ Write the `countIncreasingCols` method, which returns the number of columns in `grid` that are in increasing order. A column is considered to be in increasing order if the element in each row after the first row is greater than or equal to the element in the previous row. A column with only one row is considered to be in increasing order. \r\n\r\nThe following examples show the `countIncreasingCols` return values for possible contents of `grid`. \r\n\r\nThe return value for the following contents of `grid` is `1`, since the first column is in increasing order but the second and third columns are not. \r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"> 10 50 40 <br> 20 40 20 <br> 30 50 30 </p>\r\n\r\nThe return value for the following contents of `grid` is `2`, since the first and third columns are in increasing order but the second and fourth columns are not. \r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"> 10 540 440 440 <br> 220 450 440 190 </p>\r\n\r\nComplete the `countIncreasingCols` method.",
