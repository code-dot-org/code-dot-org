An object is a location in memory with a name and properties. It associates a bunch of smaller pieces of information together. \r\n\r\nAnother type of object is the Game Lab area. The game area has properties but many of them are read-only which means you can only get information form the property, you can't set it. \r\n\r\nOne of the coolest properties that the Game Lab area has are the x and y location of the mouse! You can access the x and y location of the mouse using `Game.mouseX` and `Game.mouseY`.  This follows the pattern you learned before. `Game` is the name of the object. `mouseX` and `mouseY` are the names of the properties.\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\nYou are going to make the sprite follow the mouse around the window.\r\n\r\n* Create a sprite that draws in the center of the window\r\n* In order to continously update the position of the sprite to the position of the mouse you will need to put the following statements inside the draw loop:\r\n\t* Set the x position of the sprite to the value of `Game.mouseX`\r\n    * Set the y position of the sprite to the value of `Game.mouseY`\r\n* Run the program to test that it works"
