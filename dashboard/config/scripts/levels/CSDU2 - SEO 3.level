The description is added using the `<meta>` element. It has two attributes, the name and the content. The content is where the actual description goes. **Every page should have its own description.**\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n&lt;head&gt; \r\n\t&lt;meta name=\"description\" content=\"Your meta description goes here \" /&gt;\r\n&lt;/head&gt;\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nJust like the title tag this will not show up physically on the page but will be used by search engines to display information about your page. Sometimes the description will also be used when you share the link on social media platforms. \r\n\r\n*Just like titles the search engine might decide it knows best and generate a description for the page that is different than the one you provided.*\r\n\r\n## What goes in a description?\r\n\r\nA good description will follow these guidelines:\r\n\r\n* **Descriptive:** Unique description of what someone will find on this page\r\n* **Keywords:** Uses keywords in full sentence descriptions which someone might use to search for your page\r\n* **Short:** Less than 150 characters\r\n* **Avoid Special Characters:** Don't use special characters such as ‘”<>{}[]()\r\n* **Enticing:** It makes someone want to look at your web page.\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\n* Add descriptions to each web page on your website using the `<meta>` tag \r\n* Test it out!\r\n\t* Open <a href=\"http://www.seocentro.com/tools/seo/seo-analyzer.html\" target=\"_blank\"> SEO </a>\r\n    * Re-load the results for your page to use the most updated version\r\n    * Under the <img src=\"https://images.code.org/01e0d19ff0278ba750efc3b3824b31b0-image-1477075078800.37.19 PM.png\" style=\"width:80px\"> section there is a preview of the Google Search results.\r\n    \r\n*Remember that the search engine might still decide to use something else as your description. It is not a big deal and it is still important to have a description.*",
