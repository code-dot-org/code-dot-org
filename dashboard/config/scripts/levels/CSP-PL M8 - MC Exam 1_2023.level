We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect.

    "long_instructions": "# Understanding the AP Multiple Choice Exam\r\n\r\n**Goals:** The purpose of this and the next two levels are: \r\n\r\n* To understand the structure of the AP multiple choice exam.\r\n* To determine what skills and knowledge students need to be successful for the AP multiple choice exam.\r\n*(Estimated time: ~60 minutes)*\r\n\r\n**Note**: If you are not teaching this course as an AP course, this section may still benefit you if you decide to teach the course as an AP in the future. \r\n\r\n## AP Multiple Choice Exam Basics\r\nThe largest part of a student's AP score will come from the multiple choice exam which is scheduled for May 8th, 2023. The multiple choice exam makes up 70% of their final score.\r\n\r\nWhat you need to know about the Multiple Choice Exam:\r\n\r\n* It is 70 questions long and 120 minutes\r\n* The test includes questions using a pseudocode language\r\n* Eight of the questions require students to select two answers\r\n* Five of the questions require reading a passage about a hypothetical computing innovation and answering questions about the innovation\r\n* The Big Ideas and Computational Thinking Practices are not distributed equally on the exam (see below for actual weighting on the AP multiple choice exam)\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/0e8cc6f75af789b5f1296b11daeb04b5-image-1654557485858.17.41 PM.png\" width=\"600px\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the five computational thinking practices.\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/ed575fba2dd9493b9e2cdddd2713484b-image-1654557470075.16.30 PM.png\" width=\"605px\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the five Big Ideas.\">\r\n\r\n## Do This:\r\n\r\n* Read about the **Single-Select Questions with Reading Passage** on page 165 of the <a href=\"https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf\" target=\"blank\">Course and Exam Description Guide</a>.\r\n* Review practice exam questions starting on page 172 of the Course and Exam Description Guide.\r\n\r\n**Note**: We are expecting this task to take ~30 minutes as you skim both of these sections.  If you decide to dive deeper into either of these tasks it may take additional time beyond the 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nIn the next level, we will look at available resources to help you and your students prepare for the multiple choice exam.\r\n\r\n## Reflect:\r\n\r\n1. What **content knowledge** do you want to build with students further before the exam?  Consider both the “Big Ideas” and the “Computational Thinking Practices”.\r\n2. What other **test-taking skills** do you want to build with students further before the exam?",
