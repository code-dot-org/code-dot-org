When an instruction says something like: \"Make sure to make a call to `right()` inside the `drawStep()` function\" some students might try to place the *definition* for right() inside the *definition* of drawStep(), like so...\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/c2ba7f263cc6e153224054fc3394d94e-image-1496260598846.png)\r\n\r\nThis code will not work because even though `right` is defined it is never *called*.  There is another problem too -- while technically defining a function within another function definition is allowed in JavaScript it is odd and we will never have a construction like this in our course.  \r\n    \r\nThe intention is for each function definition to stand on its own.  And for other code to *call* those functions.  Here is the expected response (notice how `right()` is *called* from within `drawStep`).\r\n    \r\n![](https://images.code.org/ecd74618d21bbb6f4a4ce69bfb920411-image-1496260783203.png)",
