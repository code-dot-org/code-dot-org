When making apps in App Lab which are event driven you usually go through the following steps:\n\n1) Add a UI element to the screen\n * set its visual properties, position, size, color, etc.\n * note its ID\n    \n2) Add an onEvent block\n * specify the *ID* of the screen element to you want the user to interact with\n * specify the *type* of event you want to watch for\n * ...\n    \n3) Write code in the function\n * The code describes what you want the app to do *WHEN* the specified type of event happens on the specified ID\n\n4) Run - Test - Debug\n * If the program doesn't work at first (this is very common) try try again\n * You may run into **syntax** errors - things you misspelled or wrote in such a way the computer doesn't understand what you're trying to say - fix these with careful reading.\n * Or you may run into **logic** errors - the program runs but doesn't do what you think it should.\n\n# Don't Worry!\n\nEven for professionals, it's very common to go through several cycles of run-test-debug to get it right even for *very* small programs or pieces of code.  It's the nature of the business.\n"
