It specifies which elements will have to follow the rules inside the curly braces. The `p` stands for paragraph.\r\n* `letter-spacing: 5px;` is the rule that makes the characters inside the `p` tags be spaced out by 5 pixels each.\r\n  * `letter-spacing` is the _property_.  It explains what the rule is about, in this case the space between each character.\r\n  * `5px` is the _value_.  It explains how the rule should be applied, in this case making each character spaced 5 pixels from each other.\r\n\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**What does `px` mean / What is a pixel?**]\r\n\r\nPixel, which is abbreviated `px`, is how elements are measured in CSS.  It’s the size of a single point of light on the screen.\r\n\r\n\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**Why doesn't `letter-spacing: 0px;` do anything?**]\r\n\r\nMost properties have default values.  The default values are the styles that an element will have automatically, before you add your style sheet.  The default value for `letter-spacing` is `0`, so it doesn't change from how it already looked.\r\n\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**What are the possible values for letter spacing?**]\r\n\r\nYou can choose between negative and positive numbers. Negative numbers space the letters closer to each other while positive numbers space the letters out further.\r\n\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**Why do I need all the punctuation?**]\r\n\r\nThe punctuation, such as the curly braces `{}`, the colon `:`, and the semicolon `;`, help the computer to understand the rules in the style sheet.  The curly braces hold all the rules for a particular selector.  Each rule should end in a semicolon, and the properties and values are always separated by a colon.\r\n\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**What is a style sheet?**]\r\n\r\nA style sheet is a document that controls how a web page will appear.  External style sheets are separate files that are linked to the HTML page.\r\n\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**What is CSS?**]\r\n\r\nCSS is a language that controls the way content on a web site appears.  It uses rule-sets to change the look of a page.  Each rule set has a selector, which specifies which elements on the page will be affected, and the rules, which explain how to display the elements.   Each rule consists of a property and a value for that property.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nHere’s an example of a rule-set that makes the text in an `h2` tag blue and cursive:\r\n\r\n```\r\nh2 {\r\n   color: blue;\r\n   font-family: cursive;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, `h2` is the selector, `color` and `font-family` are properties, and `blue` and `cursive` are the values for those properties.\r\n:::\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n# Letter Spacing\r\n\r\nThe `letter-spacing` property sets the space between each letter between text elements.\r\n\r\n* Find the CSS code that is making the letters in \"Orchids!\" in the `h1` tag be spaced out more than normal.\r\n* Change the `h2` tag so that the letters are spaced out by two pixels.\r\n* Change the letter spacings of the paragraph and `h3` tags as well.",

With not enough light, it can look like the orchid is growing great, but will not bloom flowers. So give your orchid light.\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n  <h3>Watering Orchids<\\/h3>\\r\\n  <p> \\r\\n    Improper watering is probably the top reason orchids die. Unfortunately, there is no one trick solves all when it comes to watering an orchid. Depending on where you live will affect how much you water your orchid. The only advice is to water the orchid right as it starts to dry out. How do you know when it's drying out? Some tips to help is to see if the top of the potting mixture is dry. Also if dry it will be lighter than when watered. And if all else fails, you can put your finger or a stick into the potting mixture to check if the potting mixture is moist or not.\\r\\n  <\\/p> \\r\\n\\r\\n  <h3>Should I Fertilize?<\\/h3>\\r\\n  <p>\\r\\n    If you want to fertilize your orchid, make sure to choose a fertilizer with little or no urea in it because an orchid cannot use urea that well. And then if you do get fertilizer, use it once per week in the summer and then once every two weeks in the winter and fall.\\r\\n  <\\/p> \\r\\n<\\/body>\\r\\n<\\/html>  \\r\\n\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n",
