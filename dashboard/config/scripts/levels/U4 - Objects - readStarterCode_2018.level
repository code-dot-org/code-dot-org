(Answer: **Not much** - you'll be adding the rest of the functionality.)\r\n* **Look through the starter code** to understand what you already have available.\r\n* **Go into Design Mode** as well and look at the different UI elements and their IDs. \r\n\t* **Notice that there are 2 screens** with descriptive IDs already given.\r\n* Once you're comfortable with the starter code, move on to the next exercise.",
