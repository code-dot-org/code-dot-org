In general, it’s important to have a sense of what each lesson is about, and how the lessons fit together. The best way to get to that point is by reading lessons and doing the activities yourself. \r\n\r\nHere are a few tips for getting up to speed on the lessons in the curriculum: \r\n- **Review** the [CS Principles 2021 Curriculum Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k0wytFCORchnEg4G214yVFMZXJcUa2PoKaw-TrxtLjI/edit) for details on the philosophy of the unit and lessons.\r\n- **Read** the [lesson plans](https://studio.code.org/courses/csp) and **do** the lessons! This means work through the core activities in the lessons after you’ve read the lesson plans.\r\n- **Read** the [forum](https://forum.code.org/c/csp/12 ) to see common questions teachers have asked and helpful information others have shared.\r\n- **Read** the agenda walkthrough resources for an understanding of what teachers are expected to know and do at the end of the workshop.\r\n- **Use** the agenda to understand the essential practices and lesson decisions for the lesson(s) used for the model lesson or lesson exploration sessions.\r\n- **Work** through and talk about your thoughts on the reflections with another facilitator or CS Principles teacher. While it’s important that the final work you submit is your own, we highly encourage you to collaborate in the process of becoming comfortable and familiar with the lesson material and how to support the teachers' understanding of it.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n> **Reflect on Content and Philosophy:**\r\n> 1. What skills and knowledge should students leave the unit with?\r\n> 1. Which Big Idea(s) are students learning the most about? Where and how are those BI(s) addressed?\r\n> 3. Which skills or Computational Thinking Practices are honed through the activities and projects?\r\n> 4. What is the connection between early lessons and later lessons?\r\n> 5. How is the content spiraled or scaffolded within the unit?\r\n> 6. What foundation is being laid early on and how is it leveraged throughout the unit? Why?\r\n> 7. Which lessons are particularly tricky to teach in this unit and why?\r\n> 8. What summative and formative assessment opportunities are built into the unit?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Use the space below to take notes and record your thoughts.  **This level is for your use only**.\r\n ",
