It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect. How would you describe the difference between computer science and coding? How would you explain sequencing and algorithms to your students? ",

    "long_instructions": "# Other Capabilities of the Data Visualizer Tool\r\n\r\nIn Lessons 3 and 4, students learn about other types of charts the Data Visualizer can create along with other features that help students analyze data. \r\n\r\n## Cleaning and filtering data\r\n\r\nIn <a href=\"https://studio.code.org/s/csp9-2022/lessons/3\" target=\"blank\">Lesson 3</a>, students learn how to filter and clean data in App Lab.\r\n\r\nIt is important that students understand the following vocabulary from the lesson:\r\n\r\n* **Filtering data** allows the user to look at a subset of the data. For example, if I have a data set of all female legislators but I only want to look at a list of female legislators from the state of Nebraska, I can **filter** the data to look at the subset of data dealing with Nebraska. \r\n\r\n* **Cleaning data** means taking “messy” data and making sure it is complete, valid, and in a format that is usable for analysis.  For example, if I collect data in a survey about how many hours of sleep someone got last night and the data shows responses such as “7”, “8 hours”, “~7 hrs” or “not enough”, that data is messy and cannot be analyzed.  This data needs to be cleaned.  Most datasets are cleaned prior to being used by students, therefore this may be students’ first experience considering what data might look like when it is initially collected. \r\n\r\n## Creating crosstab and scatter plot charts\r\n\r\nIn <a href=\"https://studio.code.org/s/csp9-2022/lessons/4\" target=\"blank\">Lesson 4</a>, students learn how to compare two different columns of data in a data set.  To do this, they learn to create a crosstab, and a scatter plot chart.  Similar to Lesson 2, students learn how to read these charts first before creating their own.  \r\n\r\nThis lesson contains a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/4vaWVvrnsFk\" target=\"blank\">video</a> for students to watch as a class to learn how to create these types of charts.\r\n\r\nOf these two charts, crosstabs charts may be most unfamiliar to your students.  A crosstab chart counts how often pairs of values in two columns appear.  The image below is taken from the slides for this lesson to illustrate how a cross tab chart is created.  \r\n\r\n![Image demonstrating how the data from a chart of data, in this case about breed groups and their average livespans, can be translated over to a crosstab chart.](https://images.code.org/d27de254946f72bc9dbeb237273516e4-image-1605744877745.13.52 PM.png)\r\n\r\n**Reading the crosstab chart:**\r\n\r\n* The arrows show where that row in the data table would be counted in the chart.\r\n* The “2” circled in red indicates that there are two types of “Toy” dogs with a Maximum Life Span of 18 years. \r\n\r\n**Crosstab charts are useful for:**\r\n\r\n* Finding the most / least common combinations of values in two columns\r\n* Finding patterns across two columns\r\n* Exploring two columns when one or both are strings.\r\n\r\n## Do this:\r\nUsing your own copy of the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/12GkfXmELZiGPppfigSKRlgbPuizaYpXniW0lAFu8A08/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"blank\">Activity Guide</a> and the Data Visualizer found in <a href=\"https://studio.code.org/s/csp9-2022/lessons/4/levels/1?no_redirect=1\" target=\"blank\">U9L4, Level 1</a>, create your own crosstab chart by following the directions in question one on your Activity Guide.\r\n\r\n**Note**: For this activity you will want your Activity Guide and Code Studio open in two separate tabs or windows so you can toggle between the two resources. \r\n\r\n## Reflect: \r\nNow that you have used the Data Visualizer tool in two different formats, what do you think students will struggle with when creating visualizations?  Consider the interface of the tool, finding the right buttons or data sets, making sense of the visualizations after they have been created, etc.\r\n\r\n",
