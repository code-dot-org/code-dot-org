It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect.

Click on the “i” next to the unit title to access more in-depth information about the unit.  \r\n\r\n![Screenshot showing how to access a Unit Overview for Unit 3 by clicking on a white circle with an 'i' in the middle, noted with a read circle.](https://images.code.org/fde3195c9f5d0c9cab89f804cab2a3fc-image-1625172915530.54.28 PM.png)\r\n\r\n* Review the rubric for the Unit 3 project found in the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JXIaQGRKzsw9UvZh58yLfkriV2QH7fTE51Omr8OJ1aM/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"blank\">Planning Guide</a> in Unit 3, Lesson 3 on Page 7.\r\n* In both these documents, pay attention to what skills and knowledge students will learn and develop during the unit.\r\n\r\n## Reflect: \r\n* Based on what you read, what skills and knowledge will students develop during Unit 3?\r\n* What differentiation do you anticipate you will need to provide to help all students achieve learning goals?\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size:11px;\">**Note:** Your cohort's facilitators will be able to see your response, but your response will not be seen by other participants in your cohort. Facilitators will use these reflections to inform their planning for the upcoming synchronous call, but the primary purpose of these reflections is to allow you time to process or apply what you learn in the asynchronous work. For that reason, feel free to write as much or as little as is helpful for you - this might be 2 paragraphs, 2 sentences, or a list, etc. You don't need to worry about spelling or punctuation in this space either - this is your space!</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size:11px;\">Finally, you can always adjust the size of the text box by clicking and dragging the bottom-right corner of the text box if more space is needed.</span>\r\n\r\n",
