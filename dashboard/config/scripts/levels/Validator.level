Often this is because you either missed a rule of HTML, or didn’t describe your content specifically enough. Fortunately there’s a tool called the Validator that can check your code for errors!\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\n* Open up the <a href=\"https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input\" target=\"_blank\">Validator - Website</a>\r\n* For each html file in your project\r\n\t* Copy the html into the box\r\n    * Click check to see if there are an error\r\n\t* Make a list of all unique errors.\r\n    * For each error, write in your own words what you think it means\r\n    * For each error, search to find a potential solution.",
