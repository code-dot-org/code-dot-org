If we can develop a model or simulation of the phenomenon we wish to investigate, we can confirm our hypotheses much more quickly without the risks or costs associated with a real-life experiment.\n\n## Vocabulary\n\n**Simulation:** a program which replicates key features of a phenomenon in order to assist investigations of its behavior without the associated cost, time, or danger of running an experiment in real life.\n\n## Lesson\n\n* Calculate statistics from a coin flipping experiment.\n* Create a simulation to repeat this experiment for much larger inputs.\n* Create updated hypotheses based on the results of simulations.\n\n## Resources\n\n* Activity Guide: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xLzpruWj1foU23cVDGAcq7WoH_QCvAbSGpT-QT5tp0s/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">Flipping Coins</a>\n\n<a class=\"btn btn-large btn-primary next-stage submitButton\">Continue</a>\n"
