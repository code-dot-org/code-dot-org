While the goal of the lesson is to help students become more confident with the concept, the teacher still plays a role in helping students gain that confidence in Practice lessons.\r\n\r\n## Reflect\r\n* What responsibilities do you have as the teacher during the Practice lesson type?  What responsibilities do the students have?\r\n* How are these responsibilities different from those in the Explore and Investigate lessons?  How are they the same?\r\n",
