It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect.

Keeping your own needs in mind, below are some ideas for you to consider for the future.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"\" target=\"blank\"></a>\r\n\r\n## Connecting Locally\r\nHow we can stay connected with one another in our local CS community:\r\n\r\n* Create or maintain open communication channels such as Facebook groups or mailing lists within this group.\r\n* Make a plan to check in with individuals you have gotten to know through this program.\r\n* Join (or create) your own CSTA branch chapter.  Not sure if your region has a chapter? <a href=\"https://csteachers.org/305564/Page/Show?ClassCode=Page&Slug=about-csta-chapters\" target=\"blank\">Search for your state.</a>\r\n\r\n## Connecting Nationally\r\nHow we can stay connected with the national CS community:\r\n\r\n* <a href=\"https://csteachers.org/page/individual-membership\" target=\"blank\">Become a CSTA member</a> to receive newsletters about opportunities for CS teachers across the nation.\r\n* Join social media outlets for CS education.  For example, Facebook has several CS Principles Teacher groups such as <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/APComputerSciencePrinciples\" target=\"blank\">AP Computer Science Principles Teachers</a>.  Or, if you’re a Twitter user consider following <a href=\"https://twitter.com/csteachersorg\" target=\"blank\">CSTA on Twitter</a> and follow hashtags they are using.\r\n* Post or learn from others at <a href=\"forum.code.org\" target=\"blank\">forum.code.org</a>. This forum is actively moderated and can be a great place to pose questions to other teachers who are also using Code.org materials for their courses.\r\n* Look for other <a href=\"https://www.csteachers.org/page/quality-pd\" target=\"blank\">PD opportunities</a> for CS teachers.\r\n\r\n## Do this:\r\nSpend ~5 minutes reviewing the communities mentioned above or researching other ways to connect to communities you are aware of. \r\n\r\n## Reflect:\r\n\r\nChoose ONE of the following to reflect on:\r\n\r\n* What ways do you think you might be interested in engaging with the communities above?  \r\n* What other opportunities did you find or think of to stay connected with the CS education community?  \r\n* What additional opportunities were you looking for that you couldn’t find?",
