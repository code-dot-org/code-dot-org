Instead, you'll need to use **one loop after another**, each one solving a part of the problem. \r\n\r\n# Do This:\r\n\r\nAdd a loop to fill the screen with semi-transparent white dots until the original dots are \"erased\".\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/329912b3c61cc62acbd36035ff4b823a-image-1443109101866.gif\" style=\"float: right; width: 100px\">\r\n* **Drag ** a second loop into your code that will run after the first loop.\r\n* **Add** commands to draw dots in random locations that are white with opacity set to 0.5.\r\n* **Increase the iterations** so that the colored dots are totally erased. How many does it take?\r\n\r\nHINT: you can copy/paste the original loop and just change the color of the dots and number of iterations.\r\n\r\n",
