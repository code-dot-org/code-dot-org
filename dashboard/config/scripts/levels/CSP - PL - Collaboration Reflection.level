It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect.

But in reality, programmers collaborate and communicate frequently!  \r\n\r\nThere is also a time and place for independent work while students are learning to code.  As the teacher, it is your role to consider when, where, and how you want to encourage collaborative work vs. independent work in your classroom.  \r\n\r\nBefore we develop a framework for when we want to encourage students to work independently or collaboratively, let’s brainstorm some pros and cons of each of these options.  \r\n\r\n## Reflect:  \r\n* What are some pros and cons of having students work independently when programming?\r\n* What are some pros and cons of having students work collaboratively when programming?\r\n\r\n",
