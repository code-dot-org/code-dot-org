Using the Internet Simulator you can solve the problem of how to coordinate sending messages between two devices more quickly. This tools simulates a single wire shared between two people.  \n\n# Vocabulary\n\n* Bit Rate: The speed at which a system is able to transmit bits.\n\n# Lesson\n\n* Use the \"Internet Simulator\" to send bits between two points. \n* Create a protocol for encoding messages to be sent using the widget.\n* Interpret the bits as they are received by the widget.\n\n\n# Resources\n\n<!-- * [Bit Sending Widget](http://bit.ly/sendingBits_AB -->\n<!-- * Video [Demonstration of the Widget](http://youtu.be/dubPPv_ECPA)  -->\n* Student Activity: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Oyfk9VC9ymoDTCG-Z5pC95zupRI4FBTttO2rqvCUlcs/edit?usp=sharing\">Coordination on the Internet</a>\n\n<a class=\"btn btn-large btn-primary next-stage submitButton\">Continue</a>\n\n\n"
