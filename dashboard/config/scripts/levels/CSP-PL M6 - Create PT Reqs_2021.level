It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect.

These lessons are intended to help students fully understand the requirements before they start working on the task.  We will be using some of these resources in this module to help you also understand the task.  \r\n\r\n## High-level description of the Create Performance Task\r\n\r\nFor the Create PT, students create a program and write responses discussing the purpose of their program, their development process, and how an algorithm and abstraction work in their program.  Students submit their Create PT to the College Board including:\r\n\r\n* A video of running program\r\n* A PDF of program code\r\n* Written Responses to prompts 3a-d\r\n\r\nOther facts about the Create PT:\r\n* The College Board requires that students are given 12 in-class hours to work on the Create PT.\r\n* The Create PT is 30% of the final score.\r\n\r\nNow let's look at the details.\r\n\r\n \r\n## Do this:\r\n* Read the written response prompts starting on page 6 of the <a href=\"https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf\" target=\"blank\">student handouts</a>.  \r\n* Read the <a href=\"https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-2021-create-performance-task-scoring-guidelines.pdf\" target=\"blank\">rubric</a>, focusing on the first two columns, “Reporting Category” or “Scoring Criteria” to start.\r\n* Write down any questions you have.\r\n\r\nIn the next section, we are going to focus on areas that most frequently raise questions for students and teachers, so some of your questions may be answered soon.  Any that you have left over at the end of this asynchronous module should be put in your shared slide deck so they can be addressed in the synchronous workshop.\r\n\r\n## Reflect: \r\nWhat aspects of the prompts or rubric were surprising to you?\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12px;\">**Note:** Your cohort's facilitators will be able to see your response, but your response will not be seen by other participants in your cohort. Facilitators will use these reflections to inform their planning for the upcoming synchronous workshop, but the primary purpose of these reflections is to allow you time to process or apply what you learn in the asynchronous work. For that reason, feel free to write as much or as little as is helpful for you - this might be two paragraphs, two sentences, a list, etc. You don't need to worry about spelling or punctuation in this space either - this is your space! </span>",
