The small image associate with your website is called a **favicons**. Favicon is short for favorite icon. It displays in the tab for a website, when a website is bookmarked, and sometimes in the browsers address bar.\r\n\r\nFor example when you open a tab for Code.org it might look like this. The icon on the left is the favicon.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/9db8bd43bf27355cd6ed799358775140-image-1475697356699.55.40 PM.png\">\r\n\r\nFavicons are metadata for the website since they are used by the web browser and not content on the web page itself. Therefor they are included in the `<head>` element. To add the favicon you use the `<link>` element. The `href` still is the file path but the `rel` is \"shortcut icon\".\r\n\r\nFor Example:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n&lt;head&gt;\r\n\t&lt;link rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"logo.png\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;/head&gt;\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\n* Set your icon to be the favicon for your website. You need to add it to every page for it show up on each page.",
