But in reality, programmers collaborate and communicate frequently!  \r\n\r\n##### There is also a time and place for independent work while students are learning to code.  As the teacher, it is your role to consider when, where, and how you want to encourage collaborative work vs. independent work in your classroom.  \r\n\r\n##### Before we develop a framework for when we want to encourage students to work independently or collaboratively, let’s brainstorm some pros and cons of each of these options.  \r\n\r\n## Reflect:  \r\n* ##### What are some pros and cons of having students work independently when programming?\r\n* ##### What are some pros and cons of having students work collaboratively when programming?\r\n\r\n",
