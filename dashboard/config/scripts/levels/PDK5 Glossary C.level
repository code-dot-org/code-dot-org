The terms and concepts used in these courses are defined using words that most young students can understand.\n\n# Teaching Tip\nBest practice is to introduce the terms with easy-to-understand language, relate the terms to previous experiences, use the terms repeatedly beyond the lesson itself throughout the entire course (and in other situations) when appropriate, and reinforce students' use in oral and written communication.\n\n# Glossary\nHere is a [list of vocabulary terms](http://code.org/curriculum/docs/k-5/glossary) used throughout Courses 1, 2, and 3. The list of vocabulary terms is in the teacher dashboard in the \"Lesson Plans and Resources\" tile. You don't have to learn all these words right now. Use that list as a reference during this online PD course and when you use our courses with your students. \n\n</br>\n\n<a class=\"btn btn-large btn-primary next-stage submitButton\">Continue</a>\n"
