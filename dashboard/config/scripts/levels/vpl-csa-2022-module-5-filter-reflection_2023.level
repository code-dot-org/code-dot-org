It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect.

    "long_instructions": "# Filters throughout Unit 5\r\n\r\nThroughout Unit 5, students will create their own filters for images.  Later, in the Unit 5 project, students will use filters they created earlier in the course, as well as design some new filters to tell a personal narrative.  Let’s start by reviewing which of the filters students will have the opportunity to create within the unit.  \r\n\r\nSome of these filters are in “choice” levels where students may pick from multiple different tasks to complete, and other filters are intended to be completed by every student.  Let’s look at the filters that students will create throughout the unit. \r\n\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"10\" border=\"1\">\r\n<thead>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <th class=\"tg-0pky\">Lesson</th>\r\n    <th class=\"tg-0lax\">Level</th>\r\n    <th class=\"tg-0pky\">Filter Description</th>\r\n    <th class=\"tg-0pky\">Example Image</th>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td class=\"tg-c3ow\">6</td>\r\n    <td class=\"tg-baqh\">3</td>\r\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">Students have a choice to create a filter which modifies the color of the image.  They may remove a single color from the image, or keep only one color in the image.  This example to the right shows when all blue is removed from the image.</td>\r\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\"><img src=\"https://images.code.org/fd2f20d81ad90a64a72a95b629ab80f3-image-1667234757736.gif\" height=\"150px\" width=\"150px\" alt=\"Image with all blue removed\">\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td class=\"tg-c3ow\">8</td>\r\n    <td class=\"tg-baqh\">3</td>\r\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">All students will create a <span style=\"color:#905; font-family:Monaco\">GrayscaleImage.java</span> file which will turn a color image to a grayscale image.</td>\r\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\"><img src=\"https://images.code.org/0d57c093f7f83be1987751e0200148a6-image-1667235018076.gif\" height=\"150px\" width=\"150px\" alt=\"Image with all blue removed\"></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td class=\"tg-c3ow\">8</td>\r\n    <td class=\"tg-baqh\">4</td>\r\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">Students have a choice to create a variety of filters as listed below:<ul><li>A negative image filter (shown to the right)</li><li>A mirrored image (shown to the right)</li><li>A image with the blue amounts modified if they are over a specified amount.</li><li>A random image made of random colored pixels</li></ul></td>\r\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">\r\n    \t<img src=\"https://images.code.org/2e6aa72b28a418397ea3ecd98402b2c5-image-1667235751629.gif\" height=\"150px\" width=\"150px\" alt=\"Negative image\">\r\n        <img src=\"https://images.code.org/c0b4f8a59064c156d9cedea615047e69-image-1667235719575.gif\" height=\"150px\" width=\"150px\" alt=\"Mirrored image\">\r\n    </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td class=\"tg-c3ow\">10</td>\r\n    <td class=\"tg-baqh\">4</td>\r\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">Students have a choice to “shift” a 2D array using a console based program or with a Theater-based program.

Students will modify working code during these levels. \r\n\r\nHaving these experiences analyzing working code and also creating well-defined filters throughout the unit will help prepare students to do the Unit 5 project as well as give them practice using 2D arrays of objects. \r\n\r\n## Reflect\r\nIn the space below, consider:\r\n\r\n* What other filters do you think students may want to create during this unit?\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n**Up next:** We will make our own filters!",
