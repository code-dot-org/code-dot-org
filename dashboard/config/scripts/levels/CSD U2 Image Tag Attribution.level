The attribute `src` stands for **s**ou**rc**e and tell the name of the image. Image files names include extensions which tell the computer which type of image they are working with. Common extensions are .jpg, .jpeg, .png. <br><br>\r\n\r\nIn addition to have the src attribute, image elements also have the `alt` attribute which describe the image. This is important in case the image doesn’t load or for people who have trouble with their eyesight. <br><br>\r\n\r\nAn `<img>` tag is an example of a  **self-closing tag** because it starts and closes in one tag. To mark this we put the `/` which usually goes in the close tag at the end of the image tag.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>**Why does an image tag not have a closing tag?**</summary>\r\nAn image tag doesn't need a closing tag because there is no text content which must be wrapped in tags. The content that shows on the screen is specified through the tags attributes.\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>**What is an attribute?**</summary>\r\nAttributes are extra information included in a tag.  Attributes have names and values. The name tells what type of information is being provided and then the value gives the specific information for that tag. \r\n\r\nFor example &lt;img&gt; tags have two attributes, src and alt. src specifies the name of the image file and alt tells the browser in readable text what the image is.\r\n</details>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n# Giving Credit\r\n\r\nWhen using a Creative Commons licensed image, you need to give credit to the original creator (this is also called _attribution_). There are lots of ways to provide attribution, but the easiest way is to add text below the image that identifies the creator and website it came from.\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\nIn this page we've already added and attributed an image of a frog. Use the Creative Commons search engine to find another image of an amphibian. Add your found image to this page, along with proper attribution, including:\r\n\r\n* The name of the creator (if available)\r\n* The website it was found on (e.g. commons.wikimedia.org)\r\n* The license it was published under (e.g. CC-BY)",
