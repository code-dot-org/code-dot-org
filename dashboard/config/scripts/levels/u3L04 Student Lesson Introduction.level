Sometimes even the sub-problems can be abstracted into even more basic sub-sub-problems. This is referred to as \"levels of abstraction.\" There is not necessarily only one way to abstract a problem. Different approaches can be equally valid.\n\n# Lesson\n\n* Play a \"What's That Made Up Of?\" game.\n* View a video explaining of procedural abstraction. \n* Compare different approaches to abstracting a problem into sub-problems. \n  \n\n\n# Resources\n* Activity 1: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xOxkKC-mAVZy030WzcUY8_v5yc_a0DQx5XZ13-9cXg8\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Abstraction </a>  \n* Activity 2: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q17UVRkqxOo3vk5UIX3UWbJuxQVFYWWxpv4Cum6T2eo\" target=\"_blank\">\n Comparing Drawing Solutions </a>  \n\n\n<a class=\"btn btn-large btn-primary next-stage submitButton\">Continue</a>\n",
