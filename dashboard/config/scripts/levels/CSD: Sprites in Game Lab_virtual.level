The most important aspect for students to understand is that sprites allow them to organize a lot of information about something that they want to draw to the screen.  \r\n\r\nStudents should make the connection between properties and variables, that both hold information that their program needs to run.  Properties are accessed through their sprites, and Game Lab sprites already have specific properties that are automatically created when students create each sprite, such as x position, height, and rotation.  \r\n\r\nSprites solve the problem of organizing a lot of information about how something should be drawn to a screen.  Rather than creating new variables to hold all of that information, sprites use properties to hold all of the information about one thing that is drawn to the screen."
