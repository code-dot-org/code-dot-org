You can read more about this property at <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_border-style.asp\">W3Schools - CSS border-style Property</a>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>**What does the `border-radius` property do?**</summary>\r\nThe `border-radius` property determines the radius of the curves at the corners of the element.  A bigger radius makes a bigger, softer curve, and a smaller radius makes a smaller, sharper curve.  A radius of zero makes a regular corner.  You can read more about this property at <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_border-radius.asp\">W3Schools - CSS3 border-radius property</a>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>**What does the `float` property do?**</summary>\r\nThe `float` property makes an element \"float\", meaning that the elements that come after it all flow around it.  If the `float` value is `left`, the element will float to the left, and the elements after it will show up on its right.  If the `float` value is `right`, the element will float to the right, and the elements after it will show up on its left.
