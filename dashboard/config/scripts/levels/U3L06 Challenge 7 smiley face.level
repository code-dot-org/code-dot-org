If you want to get the turtle to a specific position on the screen using only `moveForward()` or `turnLeft()`, you need to know the turtle's location beforehand.\r\n\r\nTwo new commands in the toolbox help resolve this issue. `moveTo()` moves the turtle to a location on the screen based on its X and Y coordinates. `turnTo()` turns the turtle in a specific direction. Together these commands can make many drawings easier to complete.\r\n\r\n# Do This:\r\n\r\n**Read the documentation:** Read the documentation for `moveTo()` and `turnTo()`. Pay specific attention to how the coordinate system is arranged in App Lab as it is different from what you might have seen in a math class.\r\n\r\n**Draw the smiley:** Use these new commands to help you draw the smiley face pictured below.\r\n\r\n**HINT:** You can't really do this one without using `penUp()` and `penDown()`.\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/20cab2a0b3a4fdfd53d7a1876963fa10-image-1441990625064.png)",

A student can specify an exact location to move the turtle using x and y coordinates, and can specify a direction for the turtle to turn using a value between 0 and 360. Students combine these commands with those used previously to draw a smiley face.\r\n\r\nValidation note: we don't check to see if the student actually drew this exact figure.
