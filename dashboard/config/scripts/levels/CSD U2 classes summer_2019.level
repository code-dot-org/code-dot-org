The `class=winter` inside the opening tag adds everything inside the tag to the class.\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>\r\n<strong>How do I create a new rule-set?</strong>\r\n</summary>\r\n\r\nYou can create a new rule-set by following the pattern that the `winter` and `spring` classes used in the style sheet.\r\n<pre>.winter {\r\n  color: rgb(195,230,255);\r\n}</pre>\r\n\r\nThe selector name and the color values will be different, but the following pattern is always the same.\r\n\r\n<pre>.classname {\r\n  property1: value1;\r\n  property2: value2;\r\n}</pre>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>\r\n<strong>Why does the selector have a period in front of it?</strong>\r\n</summary>\r\nIn CSS, a period in front of a selector means that the selector is the name of a class.  If there is no period, it means that the selector is the name of an HTML tag.\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>\r\n<strong>Why would a web developer use classes?</strong>\r\n</summary>\r\n\r\nA web developer uses classes when some elements should be styled differently than others, even if they are the same tag.  Classes can also be used to give elements that have different tags the same style.\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n# Summer and Autumn Classes\r\n\r\n* Inside the style sheet, create a new rule-set for a \"summer\" class.\r\n* Add a rule to set the text in the summer class to your summer RGB color.\r\n* Add the summer class to the summer elements in the HTML page.\r\n* Do the same for the autumn class.",
