This is called an RGB value (short for Red-Green-Blue).  You can use the widget on your left to try out different RGB values and see what colors they make.\r\n\r\n* **Click \"Run\" to start the widget on the left,** and use the sliders to adjust the levels of red, green, and blue light.\r\n* For each of the colors below, match it to its RGB value.

RGB uses _additive color mixing_.  In additive color mixing, red and green make yellow, red and blue make magenta, and blue and green make cyan.  When you mix the three primary colors together (red, green, and blue), they make white.
