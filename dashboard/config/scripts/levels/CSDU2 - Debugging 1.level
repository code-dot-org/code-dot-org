So part of being a good computer scientists is about being able to find your mistakes and fix them. In computer science we call mistakes **bugs**. Bugs can be anything in code which causes it not to work as planned. The process of finding and fixing those bugs is called **debugging**.  Debugging is a problem solving process so use your problem solving steps as you try to debug. Over the next couple levels you are going to work on your debugging skills.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/ed7cb1f2e093b9c36b82bfbf9bbcd76b-image-1474383288840.54.26 AM.png\" style=\"float:right;border:black solid 5px;width:200px\">\r\n\r\nThe desired web page is on the right.
