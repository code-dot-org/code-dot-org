When you add content to your projects you'll need to do it between the `<body>` and `</body>` tags since it should be part of the body of your webpage.\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\n* Write three separate sentences about any topic you like inside of the body tags of your web page\r\n* Hit \"Refresh and Save\" if you don't see the changes in the Preview area\r\n* Compare your work with a neighbor. Make sure you're placing code in the same place.\r\n"
