It is time to use these in your Personal Website. To start, get all the style into one external style sheet linked to each web page.\r\n\r\nYou can mark the different sections of the .css file with comments. Comments in CSS use different notation than comments in HTML. Comments in CSS look like this: `/* This is a comment */`\r\n\r\nTo break up your CSS use file you might want to use comments like this and put the style for each page below the comment for that page.\r\n<pre>\r\n/* Style applied to all pages */\r\n\r\n/* Style for: index.html */\r\n\r\n/* Style for: About Me Page */\r\n\r\n/* Style for: Recipe Page */\r\n\r\n/* Style for: Hobbies */\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\n* Create a CSS file and name it style.css\r\n* Copy the section comments from above to help you organize your style.css file\r\n* Cut/Paste the CSS code from inside each `<style>` element on each page to to style.css\r\n* Delete the `<style>` elements in each HTML document.\r\n* Link the stylesheet to each document in a project.",
