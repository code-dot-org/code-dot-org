When there are specific things you want to style differently you have practiced using classes. It is time to use these in your Personal Website. To start, get all the style into one external style sheet linked to each web page.\r\n\r\nYou can mark the different sections of the .css file with comments. Comments in CSS use different notation than comments in HTML. Comments in CSS look like this: `/* This is a comment */`\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\n* Create a CSS file and name it style.css\r\n* Cut/Paste the CSS code from your <a href=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">style tester level</a> to style.css\r\n* Link the stylesheet to each document in a project.",
