The title is more than just putting a header on your page. A computer won't be able to easily go through the content of your web page to find your header (it could be in lots of different types of tags). So instead **every web page includes a title element marked by a &lt;title&gt; tag.** This title does not show up anywhere on your page so it is not part of the content of your page.\r\n\r\nSince the title is not part of web page content it goes in a special area at the top. This area is for all information about your web page that is not content. This information is often called **metadata**.  **Metadata goes in the head element marked by a &lt;head&gt; tag.**  The title element is a child element of the head element so the title element goes inside the head element.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n&lt;head&gt;\r\n   &lt;title&gt; My Awesome Website &lt;/title&gt;\r\n&lt;/head&gt;\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\n* Add a &lt;head&gt; element above the first content in your page\r\n* Add a &lt;title&gt; element inside the &lt;head&gt; element. Makes sure to give your page a descriptive title.\r\n* Once you have done this return to the <a href=\"https://studio.code.org/s/csd2/stage/5/puzzle/3\">validator level</a>",
