It specifies which elements will have to follow the rules inside the curly braces, in this case, the images.\r\n* `width: 250px` is the rule that makes the image 250 pixels wide.  It also changes the height so that the image does not stretch.\r\n\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**What does the `width` property do?**]\r\n\r\nThe `width` property determines how wide the element will be.  Most of the time, you will define the width in pixels, which makes the element take up an exact amount of space on the screen.  Defining the width will also change the height so that the image does not stretch, unless you have also defined the height.  You can read more about this property at <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_dim_width.asp\" target=\"_new\">W3Schools - CSS width Property</a>\r\n\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**What does the `height` property do?**]\r\n\r\nThe `height` property determines how tall the element will be.  Most of the time, you will define the height in pixels, which makes the element take up an exact amount of space on the screen.  Defining the height will also change the width so that the image does not stretch, unless you have also defined the width.  You can read more about this property at <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_dim_height.asp\" target=\"_new\">W3Schools - CSS height Property</a>\r\n\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**What does `px` mean / What is a pixel?**]\r\n\r\nPixel, which is abbreviated `px`, is how elements are measured in CSS.  It’s the size of a single point of light on the screen.\r\n\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**Why does using a width and height rule at the same time sometimes stretch out the image?**]\r\n\r\nWhen the width of an images changes, the height must change by the same percentage, otherwise the image will stretch.  For example, if you double the width of an image, you must also double the height, or the image will be stretched horizonally.  When you only define the width or the height, the computer will automatically change the other property so that the image looks the same.\r\n\r\n:::\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n# Width and Height\r\n\r\n* Find the property in the style sheet that controls the width of the images.\r\n* Change the width of the images to be larger or smaller.\r\n* Create a new rule with a `height` property to control the height of the images.\r\n* Use the `width` property in the `p` rule-set to change the width of your paragraphs.",
