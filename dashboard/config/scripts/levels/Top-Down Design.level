It might sound like a complex idea, but really the focus is just on starting at a high level and stating the elements you want to put into your program, then grouping concepts that are similar and using abstraction (functions) to put a label on those like parts. For example, you might say that you want to create a turtle drawing that has dogs, cats, and bikes. Then you would need to go one step further and describe how each of those components of your drawing are composed.\r\n\r\nCheck out the resource below for a non-programming example of how this grouping might work.
