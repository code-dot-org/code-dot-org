Thinking about those lessons, and looking across the other lessons in <a href=\"//curriculum.code.org/csp/unit1/\" target=_blank>unit 1</a>. Again, consider the following questions with your partner:\r\n\r\n- What opportunities have you seen for assessing learnersâ€™ knowledge (prior knowledge, knowledge gained during the lesson, etc)? \r\n- What assessments are available in the curriculum? \r\n- What strategies would be effective for checking in on what students know? \r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nOnce you've had a chance to think about what you've seen today,  work with your partner to develop a set of recommendations about balancing the teacher and the tools in Unit 1. Your recommendations should include:\r\n\r\n- Which lessons or activities present the biggest challenge with assessing student learning?\r\n- What recommendations do you have for assessing student learning in Unit 1?  \r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nUse the space below to record your recommendations (you'll share them tomorrow).
