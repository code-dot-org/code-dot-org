For now, they do not need to worry about every button, as they will be explained later, but they should understand that the inspector tool helps them to link parts of the web page with code that created them, and the refresh and save button allows them to update their webpage if it does not automatically update when they change the code.\r\n\r\nAlthough it's not part of the video, the instructions pane will also often include drop down questions and answers that students can use when they are completing an activity, and in some levels the tabs at the top of the instructions pane will take students to a \"Help and Tips\" area that includes reference information relevant to the activities."
