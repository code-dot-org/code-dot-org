Information in a computer is all represented in binary, and so computers make decisions based on a more rigid set of conditions. In fact, all decisions made by computers are based on whether some statement is true/false (represented by a single bit). Based on the result, then one of two parts of the program is chosen to run. The formal name for this process of is **selection**.\n\nThe statements on which this decision-making process is based are called **boolean expressions**. A boolean expression is any expression that can only evaluate to either **TRUE** or **FALSE**. The simplest boolean expressions are made using **comparison operators**, as shown below.\n\n|Boolean Comparison | Example |  Meaning |\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| <img src=\"https://images.code.org/1a0798d75d4242715e7608d825f95101-image-1447271431312.png\" style=\"width: 100px\"> | `1 < 9` | Is 1 less than 9? | \n| <img src=\"https://images.code.org/e45d99a63c7c1506446d5125b2154c8f-image-1447271204229.PNG\" style=\"width: 100px\">| `1 <= 9` | Is 1 less than or equal to 9? |\n| <img src=\"https://images.code.org/5ff460ac121f0ac51b569e96a4404c57-image-1447271431310.png\" style=\"width: 100px\"> | `1 > 9` | Is 1 greater than 9 ? |  \n| <img src=\"https://images.code.org/6bd8cabe859bcdcdc618ebd77848ec24-image-1447271204231.PNG\" style=\"width: 100px\"> | `1 >= 9` | Is 1 greater than or equal to 9?| \n| <img src=\"https://images.code.org/a4daa9efccea2278e165592efe343c1a-image-1447271431308.png\" style=\"width: 100px\">| `1 == 9` | Is 1 equal to 9?| \n| <img src=\"https://images.code.org/626613131395d1fa43f04547012ec173-image-1447271431305.png\" style=\"width: 100px\"> | `1 != 9` | Is 1 not equal to 9? |\n<br>\n**Note:** If you saw the statement 3 < 2 in math class, you'd think something was terribly wrong, **BUT THIS IS NOT MATH CLASS!** \n\nIn computer science, the **comparison operators ask a question that the computer will evaluate to true or false.** So you can read 3 < 2 as **\"Is 3 less than 2?\"** The answer in this case is no, or __FALSE__.\n \nOn the next level we are going to test out a bunch of these boolean expressions.\n\n<a class=\"btn btn-large btn-primary next-stage submitButton\">Continue</a>\n"
