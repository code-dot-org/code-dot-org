We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect.

What tools do you have to support students through the frustration?\r\n* How can you celebrate student successes in the classroom?  How can you make student progress and success visible?\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n**Up next:** Reflect on how you will prepare students for the Unit 4 project.\r\n",
