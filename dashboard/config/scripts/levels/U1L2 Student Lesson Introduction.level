The word \"binary\" is not actually a term from computing. Binary is used to describe a state of things that involve only two possibilities. Messages on the Internet are sent as a series of binary signals. \n\n# Lesson\n\n* Think of a message that can be communicated with such a simple message. \n* Build a device from everyday objects to communicate the message across the room. \n* Work with your team mates in an iterative design process of rapidly building and improving your device.  \n\n\n# Resources\n\n* Activity Guide: [Sending Binary Numbers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s3qa6U2mPFSH_n6Uf0I9IHV2FOzXtOlxZ3LSTOM3JTQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n* Assessment: [Sending Binary Numbers Rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sO2881fgXnLSnF29qhYbCygfKDLPz-kdL5owZofp31I/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n\n",
