Here we’ll give some examples of related topics to search in google trends. In order to do this activity you’ll first want to review the how to guide for google trends (the last resource in this module). \r\n\r\n\r\n- Once you’ve read the how to guide, head to <a href = \"https://www.google.com/trends/\" target=_blank> Google Trends <i class=\"fa fa-external-link-square\"/></a>\r\n- Play around with different queries that might reveal interesting relationships in what people are searching for on Google. For example: \r\n  -  s7 note and  samsung stock\r\n  - early voting and voter registration\r\n  - earthquake and  italy\r\n- Explore differences over time and by location \r\n  - Look at different time periods (1 week, 30 days, 90 days, 1 year)\r\n  - Look at different locations (different countries, states, cities)\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n### <a href= \"http://forum.code.org/c/csp2/lesson08\" target=_blank> Head to the Forum >></a>\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n## Share Your Findings\r\nHead to the forum and share your findings. Specifically, share: \r\n\r\n\r\n- The topics you explored in Google Trends\r\n- Surprising or interesting relationships or trends \r\n- Misconceptions that your students may have and what sorts of questions you can ask to help them overcome these barriers.\r\n\r\n\r\n##  Submit the Link for your Forum Post\r\nOnce you’ve posted in the forum, share a link here.
