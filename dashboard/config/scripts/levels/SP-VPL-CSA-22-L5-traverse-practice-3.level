This will track the number of calls home needed.\r\nTraverse through the `absences`.\r\n\r\n2. Access each element in `absences`.  Use an if-statement to check if each element is greater than or equal to 3.  When an element is greater than or equal to 3, increment the value of your variable counting the number of calls home needed.\r\n\r\n3.
