Here are portions of the prompts to consider:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. *Explain at least one beneficial effect and at least one harmful effect the computing innovation has had, or has the potential to have, on society, economy, or culture.*\r\n\r\n2. *Using specific details, describe: at least one data storage concern, data privacy concern, or data security concern directly related to the computing innovation.*\r\n\r\n\r\nRespond to both of those prompts in light of what you learned about data privacy policies in this lesson. The \"innovation\" you choose could be narrow, like a specific app, or if it makes sense broad, like an entire company.  \r\n\r\nThe main objectives of your response are to:\r\n\r\n* Name one benefit (or potential benefit)\r\n* Name one harmful effect (or potentially harmful)\r\n* Be specific about the data that (presumably) leads to the harmful effect.\r\n\r\nLimit your response to a few sentences for each point above.",
