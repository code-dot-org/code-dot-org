For example to display the dog.png file in the folder called images we would use:\r\n\r\n<pre> &lt;img src=\"images/dog.png\" alt=\"dog jumping\" /&gt; </pre>\r\n\r\nThe folder names comes first follow by the image name. We separate them with a / .\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n* Add a folder called pictures\r\n* Move all the image files into the pictures folder\r\n* Notice how all the pictures no longer show but the text in the alt attribute does.\r\n* Update the links to the images so they display again",
