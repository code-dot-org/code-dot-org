Don't spend a long time trying to understand weird results. The point to take from this is **referencing indexes that are out of bounds will almost never do what you intend**, and we'll be learning ways to avoid this as we move forward.\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\n* **Starter code** has been provided which creates an array with three elements.\r\n* One by one uncomment the **commands that reference indexes that are out of bounds** and run the code\r\n* **Examine the output** and try to understand what is happening\r\n* **Recomment** each line after you've used it to make sure you're only seeing behavior from one command.",
