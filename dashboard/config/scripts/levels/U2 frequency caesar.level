This will load a message that has been encrypted with a Caesar cipher.\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/336a6a68cc34636df21fe5ad9f43992c-image-1443566879847.gif)\r\n\r\n- Using the buttons in the Caesar substitution tab, you can shift the alphabet forwards or backwards to try to unscramble the message.\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/1783d62a944fd758cc19c5d0f73ec2c4-image-1443567014825.gif)\r\n\r\nSee how long it takes you to crack the cipher!
