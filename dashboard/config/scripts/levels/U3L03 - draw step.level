We've started you out with a definition of `right()` that you can use...\r\n\r\n# Do This:\r\n\r\n**Define** a function named `function drawStep()` which makes the turtle move forward and left as shown. NOTE: at the end the turtle should be facing the same direction it started.\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/4fa605353695afa0cd01ec01a1e2c709-image-1441772033658.gif)",
