Paragraphs in HTML can be any length of text from one word to a bunch of sentences. Paragraphs group together sets of sentences and put some space between that group of text and the next group of text.\r\n\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**How do I make multiple paragraphs?**]\r\n\r\nHere's an example of several paragraph tags in a row. This code would be placed inside of the body of your web page.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<p>This is a paragraph. It has two sentences.</p>\r\n<p>This is another paragraph.</p>\r\n```\r\n\r\n:::\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n# Use Paragraph Tags\r\n\r\nThe `<p>` `</p>` tags or \"paragraph\" start and end tags are placed around text to indicate that it is part of a paragraph. Placing text between paragraph start and end tags lets the computer know that it should be treated differently, often just spacing it out from other text.\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\n* Use `<p>` tags to separate the content into different paragraphs.",

They were brought over by boat and some are considered invasive species. Today, let's look at some animals that are native to the Americas and appreciate the diversity they bring to their ecosystems\\r\\n  \\r\\n  Coyotes are a species of canine native to North America. They are most closely related to wolves. They are not an endangered species; in fact, they are widespread throughout North America. Coyotes appear in Native American folklore, especially in the areas which are now Mexico and the Southwest United States.\\r\\n  \\r\\n  Rattlesnakes are a group of species of snakes native to the Americas, ranging from Canada to Argentina. They get their name from the \\\"rattle\\\" at the end of their tail which they can vibrate to deter other predators or warn other animals. Although their rattle can be frightening, they rarely bite without being provoked.\\r\\n  \\r\\n  Tortoises are a group of species of turtle, notable for being land-dwelling. Tortoises are the longest-living land animal in the world. Gal\\u00E1pagos tortoises, native to the Gal\\u00E1pagos Islands off the coast of Central America, regularly live to be over 150 years old\\r\\n<\\/body>\\r\\n<\\/html>\\r\\n\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}",
