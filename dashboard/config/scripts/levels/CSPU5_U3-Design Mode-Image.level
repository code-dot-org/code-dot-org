Investigate how the screen captures events (it's different).\r\n\r\n## Do This:\r\n\r\n* Add `console.log` statements to each of the 3 event handlers we started you out with.\r\n * Make the text that gets printed *be descriptive* so that you know exactly what is happening when.\r\n\r\n* **Run** the program\r\n* **Click on the overlapping objects** both the parts that overlap and the parts that don't.\r\n* **\r\n\r\n**Investigate until you can answer the questions:**\r\n1. When you click on a location where two objects are overlapping, which event(s) fire(s)?\r\n2. When you click on an non-overlapping part of some object what gets triggered?\r\n3. When does a \"click\" on the \"screen\" get triggered?\r\n\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Answers: [click here]</summary>\r\n\r\n1. When you click on a location where two objects are overlapping, which event(s) fire(s)?\r\n<br>\r\n<li> The event-handler for object that is on top gets triggered.  The object that is underneath is essentially blocked from being clicked in the overlapping portion</li>\r\n<br><br>\r\n2. When you click on an non-overlapping part of some object what gets triggered?\r\n<li>The event-handler for the object gets triggered as you might expect</li>\r\n<br><br>\r\n3. When does a \"click\" on the \"screen\" get triggered?\r\n<li>Always. Events that occur on the screen cannot be blocked by other objects.  If you set up an event listener for the screen it will capture EVERY event of that type, no matter what other UI elements are on the screen.  This behavior of the screen is done on purpose and is useful for certain kinds of things.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n",
