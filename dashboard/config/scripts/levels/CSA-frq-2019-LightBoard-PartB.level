If the light is on, return `false` if the number of lights in its column that are on is even, including\r\nthe current light.\r\n2. If the light is off, return `true` if the number of lights in its column that are on is divisible by three.\r\n3. Otherwise, return the lightâ€™s current status.\r\nFor example, suppose that `LightBoard sim = new LightBoard(7, 5)` creates a light board\r\nwith the initial state shown below, where `true` represents a light that is on and `false` represents a light\r\nthat is off. Lights that are off are shaded. \r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/0f8aaa3c45ead7259239c2203c9706eb-image-1687370726563.05.15 PM.png)\r\n\r\nComplete the evaluateLight method.",
