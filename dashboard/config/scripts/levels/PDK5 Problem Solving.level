Discuss with your students the strategies they should try, either individually or with a partner, to help get themselves unstuck while trying to solve a puzzle or write a program. Having common vocabulary as a class can be very helpful, so that when a student asks you for help, you can ask them what parts of the puzzle-solving process they have executed. Here are the 4 main steps:\n<ul>\n<li>Understand the puzzle</li>\n<li>Create a plan</li>\n<li>Perform and perfect the plan</li>\n<li>Check your work</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n<a href=\"http://code.org/curriculum/docs/k-5/PuzzleSolvingStudent.pdf\" target=\"_new\">This worksheet</a> is available in the Teacher Dashboard in the \"Lesson Plans and Resources\" tile. \n<br/>\n<br/>\n</div>\n![image](//code.org/images/puzzlesolving.png)\n\n</br>\n\n### How could you integrate this in your classroom? \n\n",
