It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect.

We will continue these discussions during the synchronous meeting by reviewing examples of using a data inquiry cycle to take informed actions in support of access, diversity, and inclusion in your classrooms and/or schools for CS.  \r\n\r\nTake this time as an opportunity to become familiar with the data inquiry cycle and its steps.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/668ba185fd067215a5eebd1218c9a8ef-image-1629413157599.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; height:50%; width:50%\">\r\n\r\n### Step 1:  Set an intention\r\n* Identify what you want to do in support of access, diversity, or inclusion in your CS classroom and/or school.\r\n\r\n### Step 2:  Gather data\r\n* Identify school and classroom student data that is available or might be collected.\r\n\r\n### Step 3:  Analyze data\r\n* Make observations about the student data collected.\r\n\r\n### Step 4:  Take informed actions\r\n* Identify actions you want to take based on the information you gathered from analyzing the student data you collected.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Reflection\r\n\r\n**Prompt**\r\n\r\nUsing student data to make informed decisions is a common practice in education.  \r\n\r\n* If you currently use or have used student data in the past to inform your classroom or school-based decisions, what actions did you take as a result of your analysis? \r\n\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12px;\">If more space is needed, click and drag the bottom-right corner to adjust the size of the text box.</span>\r\n",
