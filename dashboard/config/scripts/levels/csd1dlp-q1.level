If you haven’t already reviewed the materials, do that now and come back to this reflection later.\r\n\r\nFor this reflection, you’re going to consider the prompt below and craft a written response that demonstrates your understanding of the lessons as well as how to address teacher concerns about the unit . We suggest you write your response in another text editor and copy it in here once you are ready to submit.\r\n\r\n> **Prompt:** How would you respond to a teacher who says, “What does this problem solving unit have to do with computer science?”\r\n\r\n## Getting Credit for Completing this Reflection \r\n\r\n- Once you submit your reflection, your response to the prompt above will be shared anonymously and read by your peers, and you will read the work done by other facilitators.
