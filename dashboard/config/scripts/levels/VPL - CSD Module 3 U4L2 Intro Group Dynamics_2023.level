It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect.

These opportunities support students in further developing their communication and collaboration skills. We recognize group work brings unique challenges. Let's begin to think about supporting effective group work here and then continue with a discussion in the synchronous workshop.  \r\n\r\n\r\n**First, read through each of the following approaches to supporting effective group work.  Then, respond to the prompts below.**\r\n\r\n* **Solution Oriented:**  Group members developing solutions that incorporate ideas from multiple perspectives.\r\n\r\n \r\n* **Resolve Conflict:** Group members mediating their own group conflict.\r\n\r\n \r\n* **Contribution:** Group members, whatever their prior knowledge, having opportunities to contribute to the success of the group.\r\n\r\n \r\n* **Strengths:** Group members identifying and utilizing other group members’ strengths.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##Reflection\r\n\r\n**Prompts:**\r\n\r\n* Which approach do you feel you support best in your classroom and have strategies for that you could share with other educators?\r\n* Which approach do you feel you need strategies for the most in your classroom?\r\n\r\n",
