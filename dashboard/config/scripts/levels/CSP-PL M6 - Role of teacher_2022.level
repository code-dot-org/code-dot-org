It contains activities to help students prepare for working. Once students officially start the Create Performance Task, your role in the classroom will shift based on the College Board guidelines for what you can and cannot do while students are working on the Create PT.  In some ways, your role shifts from “teacher” to “test administrator”.  Understanding this shift will also help you understand the importance of adequately preparing students with tools and knowledge prior to starting the Create Performance Task. \r\n\r\n## Do this:\r\n* Read pages 169-171 in the <a href=\"https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles\" target=\"blank\">Course and Exam Description</a> about “Preparing for the Create Performance Task”.  This includes what the teacher can and cannot do before or during the Create PT. \r\n* Highlight information that is surprising or write down questions this generates. \r\n\r\n## Important!\r\nNote the AP Computer Science Principles Policy on Plagiarism:\r\n\r\n> The use of media (e.g., video, images, sound), data, information, evidence, or program code created by someone else in the creation of a program and/or a program code segment(s), without appropriate acknowledgment (i.e., through citation, through attribution, and/or by reference), is considered plagiarism. A student who commits\r\nplagiarism will receive a score of 0 on the performance task.\r\n\r\n## Reflect: \r\n* How do you anticipate your students will respond to this shift in your role during the Create Performance Task?  \r\n* What can you do to prepare them for this shift?",
