It’s actually not computationally intensive to compute a single modulo on a computer; it’s as fast as dividing two numbers. The commutative properties of modulo and numbers with large exponents were discovered to be the key ingredients for modern day asymmetric encryption.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe link below introduces the concept of modular arithmetic, and explains the Diffie-Hellman key exchange (described in lesson 7 using an analogy with Alice, Eve, and Bob)."
