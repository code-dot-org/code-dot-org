It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect. How would you describe the difference between computer science and coding? How would you explain sequencing and algorithms to your students? ",

    "long_instructions": "# Using user stories in your classroom\r\n\r\n## Context\r\nIt is important to remember that **students don't need to develop their own user stories for the Unit 3 project**.  Writing their own user story is an option for students who find that the user stories provided don't represent their interests.  As the teacher, you can support these students in writing their own user stories too.  For this reason, we are going into more depth in this module about user stories to enhance your own content knowledge needed for teaching.  \r\n\r\n## After writing a user story\r\nAfter students have selected or developed their user story, students start to formulate questions that they will be able to answer in the project.  The user story tells us the *who*, *what*, and *why* of the project.  Developing questions helps students focus on *how* they will help the user.  \r\n\r\n## Example\r\nLetâ€™s look at the first user story in the Project Guide in more detail to understand the process.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/e34d7d32834ee04fb3e3ff1bb3f173d5-image-1656880636559.37.06 PM.png\" alt=\"User Story A\" width=\"300\" height=\"400\">\r\n\r\nFor this user story, students are given .txt files that contain the artists, albums, and genres for the Rolling Stone's top 500 Albums.  You can see this information in <a href=\"https://studio.code.org/s/csa3-2022/lessons/11/levels/1/sublevel/1?section_id=4098340\" target=\"blank\">Code Studio</a>.\r\n\r\nBased on this user story, students will generate questions that will help them help the user.  Some example questions might include:\r\n\r\n* How many different artists are in the top 500 albums list?\r\n* How can I learn about new albums in a genre that I like?\r\n\r\n## Reflect\r\n* What other questions might students generate when looking at User Story A?  \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n**Up next:** You will look at the rubric for this project and determine how you want to adapt it for your students.\r\n\r\n",
