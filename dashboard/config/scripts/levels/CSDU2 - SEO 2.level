Although you may put an `<h1>` element on your page content with the title of your website, the computer does not necessarily know that is the title as there may be multiple `<h1>` tags on your page. To make clear to the computer what the title is the `<title>` element is added as metadata in the `<head>` element. Every page on your website needs it own title.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n<pre>\r\n&lt;head&gt;\r\n\t&lt;title&gt; My Website Title&lt;/title&gt;\r\n&lt;/head&gt;\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThis `<title>` element is not displayed anywhere on the page but the browser may use it to put a name in the tab of your web browser or display it when someone searches for your website. In fact titles are very important to search engines because titles are often a primary piece of information looked at by users to decide which websites fulfill their needs.\r\n\r\n*Sometimes search engines will still generate their own title for your page based on the user search and what the algorithm of the search engine thinks is best for supporting what the user is looking for.*\r\n\r\n## Guidelines for Creating Good Titles\r\n\r\nSince titles are so important you will want to make sure you have good titles for all the pages of your website. Here are a couple practices for making good titles. \r\n\r\nMake your title:\r\n* **Descriptive:** Make sure your title explains what someone will find on that page.\r\n* **Concise:** Keep your title short. 5 words or less.\r\n* **Individual:** Don't use the same title for multiple pages.\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\n* Add a `<title>` element to each web page on your website",
