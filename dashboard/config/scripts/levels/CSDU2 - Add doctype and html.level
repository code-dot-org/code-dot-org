In order to let the web browser know that this is an html document you need to do two things:\r\n\r\n1. Add &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; at the very top of your html file. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; is always the first thing in an html document because it notifies the computer that this is an html document and to interpret it as such. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; is not technically a tag but instead an instruction to the web browser. \r\n\r\n2. Wrap all the content of the file in an HTML element using the &lt;html&gt; tag. The &lt;html&gt; tag notifies the computer where the html starts and ends. The  &lt;html&gt; tag is the container for all other HTML elements (except for the &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; tag).  So you need an opening and closing &lt;html&gt; tag.\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\nThis is your Hobbies page from the last lesson.\r\n\r\n* Add &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; at the top of your index.html file\r\n* Add &lt;html&gt; right underneath &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; and add a closing &lt;/html&gt; tag at the end of index.html",
