    "markdown_instructions": "# Messing Around with Data\r\n\r\n**The third parameter** of `createRecord` is a callback function.  **What does it do?**\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/9a89cca8257b7dc807a1637efe121442-image-1449245629915.png)\r\n\r\n* Data commands **must be sent across the Internet to a remote server**.\r\n* The database follows a **protocol** in which it **responds to every data command with a message**. This message might be a piece of data you requested, or it could be an error message.\r\n* You might need to use the contents of this response in your program, but because of **delays caused by sending information back and forth across the Internet** you don't know when you will receive it.\r\n* Therefore, you create a **callback function that will be called by the system when the response comes back** (in other words when the database \"calls back\"). The parameter of the **callback function** contains the data being sent back.\r\n\r\nFor `createRecord` the database **responds by sending back a copy of the object that was stored**. The `record` parameter of the callback function contains that object.\r\n\r\n**Analogy**: When you made an event handler using `onEvent`, you also specified a callback function.  That function got called **when the user triggered the specific event you were watching for**.  The callback function of a database command like `createRecord` gets triggered **when the database sends a message back**.  \r\n \r\n# Do This:\r\n\r\n**Starter code is provided** that adds a song object to the database.\r\n\r\n* **Run the program.**\r\n* **Look at the Data Viewer** to verify that the object you just stored is actually in the database (along with a few extra songs we added to start you out).\r\n* **Notice:** The callback function now displays the copy of the record that was returned by the database.\r\n\r\n",
