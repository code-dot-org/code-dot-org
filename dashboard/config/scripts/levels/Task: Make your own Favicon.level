As you complete the activity, consider the misconceptions that your students may have and what sorts of questions you can ask to help them overcome these barriers. In order to do this activity, you'll want to access the color pixelation widget (which is a bubble in this module) as well as the favicon project description (linked below). \r\n\r\n\r\n- First, you'll want to play around with the color pixelation widget and get a sense of how it works.\r\n- Then, work to make your own favicon! Follow the instructions which are available in <a href = “studio.code.org/s/csp2/stage/4/puzzle/8” target=_blank>unit 2 lesson 4  <i class=\"fa fa-external-link-square\"/></a> \r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n### <a href= \"http://forum.code.org/c/csp2/lesson04\" target=_blank> Head to the Forum >></a>\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Share Your Favicon and Ideas\r\nHead to the forum and share your ideas about this activity. Specifically, share: \r\n\r\n- A screenshot of your Favicon.\r\n- Misconceptions that your students may have and what sorts of questions you can ask to help them overcome these barriers.\r\n\r\n\r\n##  Submit the Link for your Forum Post\r\n\r\nOnce you’ve posted in the forum, share a link here.
