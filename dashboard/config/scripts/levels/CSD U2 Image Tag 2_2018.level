The attribute `src` stands for **s**ou**rc**e and tell the name of the image. Image files names include extensions which tell the computer which type of image they are working with. Common extensions are .jpg, .jpeg, .png. <br><br>\r\n\r\nIn addition to have the src attribute, image elements also have the `alt` attribute which describe the image. This is important in case the image doesnâ€™t load or for people who have trouble with their eyesight. <br><br>\r\n\r\nAn `<img>` tag is an example of a  **self-closing tag** because it starts and closes in one tag. To mark this we put the `/` which usually goes in the close tag at the end of the image tag.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>**Why does an image tag not have a closing tag?**</summary>\r\nAn image tag doesn't need a closing tag because there is no text content which must be wrapped in tags. The content that shows on the screen is specified through the tags attributes.\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>**What is an attribute?**</summary>\r\nAttributes are extra information included in a tag.  Attributes have names and values. The name tells what type of information is being provided and then the value gives the specific information for that tag. \r\n\r\nFor example &lt;img&gt; tags have two attributes, src and alt. src specifies the name of the image file and alt tells the browser in readable text what the image is.\r\n</details>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n# Uploading Images\r\n\r\nYou can upload images that you've found elsewhere using the **Add Image** button. Go find an image of a different type of pet that you like and download it to your computer (using right-click \"Save As\").\r\n\r\nOnce you have your images, click ![](https://images.code.org/c35789d00e59b0dbe42879390dabf925-image-1493240590385.01.49 PM.png) and upload the image from your computer into your project, where you can then use it in your page.\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\n* Upload at least one image into this web page\r\n* Use the `<img>` tag to display the image(s) in your website.\r\n* Make sure to add an `alt` attribute.",
