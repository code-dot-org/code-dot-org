You might call it the **counter pattern** since it can be used to make a variable that counts up. You'll use this pattern a lot, especially with the draw loop. Let's see what that looks like.\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\nThis program creates a variable `counter` and then uses the **counter pattern** to make it count up. When you run the program what do you think you'll see on the screen?\r\n\r\n* **Read the program** and make a prediction of what the output will be.\r\n* **Run the program** to check your prediction.\r\n* **Discuss with a neighbor**.
