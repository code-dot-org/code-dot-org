We've started you out with a stub that **defines** a function called `right()`.  Start by adding code inside the function definition that will turn the turtle to the right (by turning left three times) when called. \r\n\r\nThen **use** this function in some code to draw a rectangle, as shown below.  Make sure the turtle ends facing the same direction and in the same location it started. *Note that the rectangle below is 2 moveForwards tall and 1 moveForward wide*\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/fd6e8b4d2218a242bae19ac9c78b5d5f-image-1447799438050.gif)\r\n\r\n**Note**: Your program will still do the same thing. We are just changing the way it is written to demonstrate that you can use functions you've already written as building blocks in new functions.\r\n\r\nYou'll use three subgoals to solve the problem: orient turtle, move turtle, and call function. Define function is already done for you. Notice that we haven't filled the subgoals in for you.If you are having trouble finding the solution, plan your approach with subgoals before filling it in with blocks. If you're not having trouble, feel free to skip the subgoals.\r\n\r\nIn workspace- prepopulate with(start of pullthrough)\r\n* Define function block(with text \"right\")",
