It is technology that allows voice recognition programs, such as Siri, to respond \"intelligently\" to your questions and commands. Some look for keywords and respond with pre-fabricated sentences. More sophisticated assistants analyze the parts of speech and the meaning of words.\n\n## Lesson\n\n* Interact with a digital personal assistant.\n* Speculate on elements in the algorithms for digital assistants. \n* Analyze the purpose, features, and interface of a digital assistant. \n* Create the user interface for a digital assistant.\n\n## Resources\n\n* Worksheet: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/code.org/document/d/18RQvHC2MUegTzwiz0ge_X3fmDQ_TGObcpt597rFy5Xo/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">Exploring Digital Assistants</a>\n\n<a class=\"btn btn-large btn-primary next-stage submitButton\">Continue</a>\n",
