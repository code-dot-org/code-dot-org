Your goal is to write code that solves the problem as efficiently as possible using only the commands provided.\r\n\r\nWhat does “efficient” mean?  In computer science it can actually mean several different things depending on what you’re talking about.  Work on these challenges, try to solve them in a way that you think is best and we’ll ask about efficiency at the end.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/d26ed114448c5ffe75a75ed761fab5f0-image-1447888033281.gif\" style=\"float:right\">\r\n\r\n# Do This: \r\nDraw a 1 x 1 square to the front and left of the turtle as efficiently as possible. The program should stop with turtle in its original position, facing its original direction.\r\n\r\nOnce you think you have a solution, click the Finish button - it will appear once you run the program.",
