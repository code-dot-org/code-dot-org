A common thing to want to do is **count** the number of times a value occurs.  We can do this with a very small change to the code we've already got. \r\n\r\n# Do This:\r\n**Starter Code** is similar to past levels.  We've also created a variable called `fiveCount`.\r\n\r\n* ** Add an `if` statement** inside the `for` loop to **increment `fiveCount` if the value is equal to 5. **\r\n (Note: this will be exactly the same as the `if` statement you wrote in the previous level. Just giving you more practice).\r\n\r\n* **Run and re-run your code** to make sure that it's accurately counting the number of 5's in the array. Since the array is getting a random set of values every time you run the program, you might have to run it a bunch of times to thoroughly test it. Make sure you get it to run at least once when no 5's appear in the array.\r\n\r\n* Finally, if you'd like to, **change the first loop in the program to add 100 items to the array** instead of 10. Your code should still work to count the number of 5's, no matter how big the original array is!",
