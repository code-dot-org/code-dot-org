    "markdown_instructions": "# For Loop\r\n\r\nIt's very common to want to repeat a set of commands a particular number of times. We have been using the `while` loop to do this so far by the creating of a counting variable, setting the boolean expression for when to stop, and incrementing the value of counter by each time.   The `for` loop was created to wrap all of those things into a single line of code.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/b93a044fc07cb4bbabb95b43132a005b-image-1447342829632.png\" style=\"width: 450px\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/d0d8f34d0f4aabaf66084ceac282448e-image-1447343652405.png\" style=\"width: 450px\">\r\n\r\nProgrammers would typically read a for loop out like this:\r\n<br> `for(var i=0; i<10; i++)` <br>\r\n\"for variable i starting at 0, while i is less than 10, i plus plus (or increment i by 1 each time)\r\n\r\nNotice that in reading a for loop we still use the word \"while\".\r\n\r\nYou may notice that when you drag a for loop out from the toolbox we've set it up for you with i, as the variable.  **Why is i the variable?**  Using the single character 'i' as the variable in a for loop has become a convention in programming for a variety of reasons. One reason is that `for` loop are often used when processing arrays - **you can think of 'i' as short hand for index. **   But there is no reason why you have to use 'i' if you don't want to.  It's just a a variable.  \r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\n* Drag out the `for` loop.\r\n\r\n* Inset a `console.log` statement inside the for loop.\r\n\r\n* Try changing:\r\n\t* The condition to stop the loop\r\n    * The amount you are counting by each time\r\n    * The starting value of i",
