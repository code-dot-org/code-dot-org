Notice that the current version of `drawSeagrass` actually uses a loop. We want to modify this function so that we control the number of times it loops with **a parameter**.\r\n\r\n# Do This:\r\n\r\n* **Look at** the `drawSeagrass` function to see how it currently works.\r\n\r\n* **Add a parameter ** that will be used to indicate how many waves the seagrass makes.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/1f2f0c5e1fc17e541760c4f0fd24b13b-image-1447887194713.7.10 drawSeagrass add param.gif\" style=\"width:350px;padding-left:22px;\">\r\n\r\n* **Modify the `'for` loop** so that it uses that **parameter** as the number of times to repeat.\r\n\r\n ![](https://images.code.org/23e8e43ec4853c0bdbbbd50b9651300a-image-1443113032135.gif)\r\n \r\n* Finally, **modify `drawAllSeagrass`** to call this new two-param version of `drawSeagrass` supplying a reasonable random value for the second parameter as well.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/4f15021cd9cebb62562665d3ddc82c51-image-1447885963677.PNG\" style=\"width:400px;padding-left:22px;\">\r\n",
