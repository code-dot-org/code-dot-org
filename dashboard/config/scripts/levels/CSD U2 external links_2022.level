The location of a local page is just the file path for that page. <br> <br>\r\n\r\nFor example to link to the unique houses page you would add the following code inside your `<body>` element. <br><br>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n<a href=\"houses.html\"> Unique Houses </a>\r\n\r\n```\r\n:::\r\n\r\n\r\n::: details [**How do I add a hyperlink?**]\r\n\r\nYou can <strong>add hyperlinks to your web page using the `<a>` element</strong>.
