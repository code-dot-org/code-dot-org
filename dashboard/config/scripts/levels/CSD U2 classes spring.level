Use this pattern to add elements to the spring class, too.\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>\n\n**What rules can be added to a class rule-set?**\n\n</summary>\r\nA class rule-set can have the same rules as any other type of selector.  If a rule does not apply to the content of the class (for example, using `font-size` on an element with no text), then the computer will ignore that rule, but still use the rules that work.\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>\n\n**Why does the selector have a period in front of it?**\n\n</summary>\r\nIn CSS, a period in front of a selector means that the selector is the name of a class.  If there is no period, it means that the selector is the name of an HTML tag.\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>\n\n**Why would a web developer use classes?**\n\n</summary>\n\nA web developer uses classes when some elements should be styled differently than others, even if they are the same tag.  Classes can also be used to give elements that have different tags the same style.\r\n\n\n</details>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n# Spring Class\r\n\r\nNow that your winter class is ready, you can start on the other seasons.\r\n\r\n* Find the empty CSS rule-set in the style sheet that gives the spring words their style.\r\n* Add two rules, one to give the text your spring color for earlier in the lesson, and another to give the text a different font, font size, or decoration.\r\n* Add the spring class to the spring elements in the HTML page.",
