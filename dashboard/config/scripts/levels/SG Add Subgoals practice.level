Once you've solved a subgoal, you can move on to the next one.\r\n\r\n# Do this\r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/4bc7896538039f1904699eba35bcd5e3-image-1508447681081.png\" style=\"float: right\">\r\n\r\n**Goal**: make the turtle draw two steps (shown at right).\r\n\r\nAfter you have understood and thought about the problem you should:\r\n\r\n1. **Start by dragging subgoals into the workspace** that you think express a solution to the problem.\r\n2. **Then** start filling it in with turtle blocks\r\n3. You should **test incrementally** as you go - add the commands to complete one goal, run the code, fix if it doesn't work, then add commands to complete the next goal and so on.\r\n\r\nWhen you think you're done click `Finish` and move on.\r\n\r\n**Stuck?** This animation shows a programmer adding goals and then code.\r\n\r\n![expandable](https://images.code.org/1805d750cb4e653ebf505f4a8a2c7840-image-1508447936880.gif)",
