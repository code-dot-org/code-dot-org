Rather than giving an answer, ask student pairs to compare their solutions with other pairs. If they agree on a solution, see if you get a class consensus. \r\n\r\n* You can also ask: Can you do it with fewer commands?  If not, can you prove that it’s impossible to do with fewer?\r\n\r\n* Questions like these are the kinds that programmers ask each other all the time.  And programmers usually work with each other to reach a solution. \r\n\r\n* An example of a solution is given in the teacher tab for the problem in Code Studio, but it is just an example; there are millions of ways to do the 3x3 grid.",
