If not, keep on researching! Otherwise it's time to start structuring the content of your page.\r\n\r\n## Hyperlinks to Websites\r\n\r\nEarlier in the unit you learned how to use the `<a>` element to link between pages on your website. You can also use this element to link to other websites. To do this the `href` attribute needs to contain the full URL of the site you wish to link to. For example if I wanted to link to the Code.org website in my project I would use the following code.\r\n\r\n| Code | Output|\r\n| ---- | ----- |\r\n| <pre> My favorite coding site is &lt;a href=\"https://code.org/\" &gt; Code.org &lt;/a &gt; ! </pre> | My favorite coding site is <a href=\"https://code.org/\"> Code.org </a> ! |\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\nThe specifics of your page layout will depend on your topics and goals, but in general you should create the following structure\r\n\r\n* A first level header with a catchy title for your page\r\n* A second level header for each separate argument to support your cause\r\n* Paragraphs of content under each second level header\r\n* A link to the appropriate site where you need to cite outside sources\r\n* Don't worry about styling right now you are just getting the content\r\n\r\nAttribution links can take many forms, for example\r\n\r\n* According to the [ASPCA](http://www.aspca.org/animal-homelessness) only 10% of animals entering shelters have been spayed or neutered.\r\n* Kill shelters euthanize 2.7 million animals per year (Source: [ASPCA](http://www.aspca.org/animal-homelessness)).",
