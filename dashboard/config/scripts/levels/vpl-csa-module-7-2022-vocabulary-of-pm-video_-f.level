Now that you have seen the project students will be working on, let’s revisit the work of project managers. \r\n\r\n**Project managers use their own vocabulary!**  In this video, you will learn about some terms project managers use.  Keep in mind that project managers in different companies might use different vocabulary.  As you watch this video, consider how the vocabulary or the concepts covered in this video have also been represented in the Unit 7 project.  Keep in mind we do not use ALL of the vocabulary in the video in the curriculum, but rather this video will give you a sense of how Code.org’s curriculum captures the essence of the work of project management. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n**Up next:** Let’s compare what we know about project management to what we know about the Unit 7 project"
