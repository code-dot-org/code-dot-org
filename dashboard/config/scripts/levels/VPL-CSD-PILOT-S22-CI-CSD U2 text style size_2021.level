It specifies which elements will have to follow the rules inside the curly braces. The `p` stands for paragraph.\r\n* `font-size: 14px;` is the rule that makes the text inside the `p` tags a particular size.\r\n  * `font-size` is the _property_.  It explains what the rule is about, in this case the text size.\r\n  * `14px` is the _value_.  It explains how the rule should be applied, in this case making the text 14 pixels big.\r\n  \r\n:::\r\n::: details [**What does `px` mean / What is a pixel?**]\r\n\r\nPixel, which is abbreviated `px`, is how elements are measured in CSS.  It’s the size of a single point of light on the screen.\r\n\r\n:::\r\n::: details [**Why do I need all the punctuation?**]\r\n\r\nThe punctuation, such as the curly braces `{}`, the colon `:`, and the semicolon `;`, help the computer to understand the rules in the style sheet.  The curly braces hold all the rules for a particular selector.  Each rule should end in a semicolon, and the properties and values are always separated by a colon.\r\n\r\n:::\r\n::: details [**What is a style sheet?**]\r\n\r\nA style sheet is a document that controls how a web page will appear.  External style sheets are separate files that are linked to the HTML page.\r\n\r\n:::\r\n::: details [**What is CSS?**]\r\n\r\nCSS is a language that controls the way content on a web site appears.  It uses rule-sets to change the look of a page.  Each rule set has a selector, which specifies which elements on the page will be affected, and the rules, which explain how to display the elements.   Each rule consists of a property and a value for that property.\r\n\r\nHere’s an example of a rule-set that makes the text in an `h2` tag blue and cursive:\r\n\r\n```\r\nh2 {\r\n   color: blue;\r\n   font-family: cursive;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, `h2` is the selector, `color` and `font-family` are properties, and `blue` and `cursive` are the values for those properties.\r\n\r\n:::\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n# Changing text size\r\n\r\nYou can control other things besides colors by using other properties.\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\n* Find the CSS rule-set in the style sheet that determines the style for the paragraph tag.\r\n* Change the text size of the paragraphs and the headings.",
