In general, it’s important to have a sense of what each lesson is about, and how the lessons fit together. The best way to get to that point is by reading lessons and doing the activities yourself. Here are a few tips for getting up to speed on the lessons in the curriculum: \r\n\r\n### **Lessons**\r\n- Read and do the actual [lessons](https://studio.code.org/courses/csp-2019)! This means work through the core activities in the lessons after you’ve read the lesson plans. If it exists, watch the teaching tips videos for the lesson. \r\n\r\n### **Forum**\r\n- Read the [forum](https://forum.code.org) for that unit to see common questions teachers have asked and helpful information others have shared.\r\n\r\n### **Curriculum Guide**\r\n- Review the [CS Principles 2019 Curriculum Guide](https://curriculum.code.org/csp-19/) for details on the philosophy of the unit and lessons.\r\n\r\n### **Working with Others**\r\n\r\n- Feel free to work through and talk about your thoughts on the reflections with another facilitator or CS Principles teacher. While it’s important that the final work you submit is your own, we highly encourage you to collaborate in the process of becoming comfortable and familiar with the lesson material and how to support teachers understanding of it.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n> **Reflect on Content and Philosophy:**\r\n\r\n> 1. What skills and knowledge should students leave the unit with?\r\n> 1. Which Big Idea(s) are students learning the most about? Where and how are those BI(s) addressed?\r\n> 3. Which skills or Computational Practices are honed through the activities and projects?\r\n> 4. What is the connection between early lessons and later lessons?\r\n> 5. How is the content spiraled or scaffolded within the unit?\r\n> 6. What foundation is being laid early on and how is it leveraged throughout the unit? Why?\r\n> 7. Which lessons are particularly tricky to teach in this unit and why?\r\n> 8. What summative and formative assessment opportunities are built into the unit?\r\n\r\n> **Reflect on Unit 5:**\r\n\r\n> 1. What advice do you have for teachers about how to handle the transition from turtle (back in unit 3) to event-driven programming (here in unit 5)?\r\n> 2. What content covered in unit 5 is required for the create PT? What content is going to be on the fixed-response exam (as shown in the exam reference guide in the course and exam description) but isn’t **required** for the performance task?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n## Use the space below to take notes and record your thoughts.
