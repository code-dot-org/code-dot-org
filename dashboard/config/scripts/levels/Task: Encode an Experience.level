As you complete the activity, consider the misconceptions that your students may have and what sorts of questions you can ask to help them overcome these barriers. In order to do this activity, you'll want to access the encode an experience activity guide and project template, both linked below. \r\n\r\n\r\n- First, you'll want to read through the <a href =”https://curriculum.code.org/csp/unit2/6/” target=_blank> lesson plan <i class=\"fa fa-external-link-square\"/></a> and the <a href=”https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kmIJlEyS4V6kU47vzyZMlENsdgLJoV-ZLyYQ2RIjuN8/edit” target=_blank> project activity guide <i class=\"fa fa-external-link-square\"/></a>\r\n- Then, encode a real life experience or event in binary! Follow the <a href = “https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qao_Qq5Z4Ta1ns_K3T7wip53MLQvJOouwFHIP2zmKsE/edit” target=_blank> project tempalte <i class=\"fa fa-external-link-square\"/></a> to step through encoding an experience of your own. \r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n### <a href= \"http://forum.code.org/c/csp2/lesson06\" target=_blank> Head to the Forum >></a>\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Share Your Encoding and Ideas\r\nHead to the forum and share your ideas about this activity.
