Encourage students to think of particular situations in which this would be the case.  For example, they might want their characters to move faster when a \"bonus\" is in effect, or maybe they want more enemies to appear when the player reaches a certain level.  Maybe they want the program to react in some way if a user presses a key or clicks the mouse, or they want a character to change animations if it touches a particular item."
