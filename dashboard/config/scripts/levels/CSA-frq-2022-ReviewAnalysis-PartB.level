The method returns an `ArrayList` of String objects containing copies of user comments from `allReviews` that contain an exclamation point, formatted as follows. An empty `ArrayList` is returned if no comment in `allReviews` contains an exclamation point. \r\n* The `String` inserted into the `ArrayList` to be returned begins with the index of the `Review` in `allReviews`. \r\n* The index is immediately followed by a hyphen (\"-\"). \r\n* The hyphen is followed by a copy of the original comment. \r\n* The `String` must end with either a period or an exclamation point. If the original comment from `allReviews` does not end in either a period or an exclamation point, a period is added. \r\n\r\nThe following example of `allReviews` is repeated from part (a).\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/468f4c4c1d3183beea029536320db13e-image-1687366413334.53.24 PM.png)\r\n\r\nThe following `ArrayList` would be returned by a call to `collectComments` with the given contents of `allReviews`. The reviews at index `1` and index `4` in `allReviews` are not included in the `ArrayList` to return since neither review contains an exclamation point. \r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/03a0545bb54784b6ed531f3b3a9615a7-image-1687366453004.54.09 PM.png)\r\n\r\nComplete method `collectComments`.
