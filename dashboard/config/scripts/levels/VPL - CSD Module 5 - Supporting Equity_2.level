It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect.

An opportunity to share your reflections and additional actions, if any, is provided during the synchronous meeting.\r\n\r\n   \r\n## Goal\r\nIdentify additional actions, if any, to include in your 30-60-90 day plan in support of equity with a focus on access and diversity.\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n* Revisit and review your commitment and 30-60-90 day plan in support of equity.\r\n\r\n\t* Consider the following questions while reviewing your commitment and plan in support of equity:\r\n\r\n\t\t* Who has access to CS at my school?\r\n\t\t* Who IS in my school and NOT in my CS class right now?\r\n\t\t* If all students **do not** take your CS class:  What barriers may prevent some students from taking my CS class?\r\n\t\t* If all students **do** take your CS class: What barriers limit access in general to CS classes at my school? (focus on retention and students taking future CS classes)\r\n\r\nClick here if you need to make a copy of the 30-60-90 day plan in support of equity.\r\n\r\n## Reflection\r\n\r\n**Prompts:** \r\n\r\n* What control or influence do you have over barriers for who has access to CS at your school?  What actions, if any, might you want to add to your 30-60-90 day plan in support of access to CS at your school?\r\n* What control or influence do you have over barriers for who is in your CS class?  What actions, if any, might you want to add to your 30-60-90 day plan in support of diversity in your CS class?\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n",
