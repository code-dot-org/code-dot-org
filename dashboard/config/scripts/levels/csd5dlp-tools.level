Reviewers will have an opportunity to give feedback on your submission, and you can respond to that feedback and resubmit.\r\n- In order to get credit for completing this prompt, two reviewers need to agree that you have responded to the prompts fully. If reviewers don’t feel comfortable making a decision about your task submission, they can elevate to an instructor for review.
