This means actively attending to gender, race,  ethnicity, ability or socioeconomic status.”*\r\n\r\n## Goals\r\n\r\n* Identify teacher support available within lessons and the curriculum that support differentiation to promote inclusion\r\n* Identify current classroom strategies you use that meet various needs of learners and promote inclusion\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n\r\n* Review the lesson plan for the model lesson, <a href=\"https://studio.code.org/s/csd5-2022/lessons/5\" target=\"_blank\">Lesson 5:  Representing Numbers</a>\r\n* Preview the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/15Y6Mo3fMUtHq16SSskABgcYE-5xfk-Ewv0z_o4uaLdI/preview\" target=\"_blank\">CSD Guide to Differentiation 2022</a>\r\n\r\n## Reflection\r\n\r\n**Prompts:**\r\n* What teacher supports and strategies are available within Lesson 5 (e.g. Teacher Tips, etc) and the CSD Guide to Differentiation 2022?\r\n* What strategies do you currently use in your classroom that promote inclusion and meet the unique learning needs of your students? \r\n\r\n\r\n",
