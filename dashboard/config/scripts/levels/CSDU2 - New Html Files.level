In order to make a website you need multiple web pages linked together.  To get you started you are going to be making an Odd Stuff Site which will include a Unique Houses page, a Crazy Signs page, and the Guinness Book of World Records page you created previously. \r\n\r\nSo far all of the web pages you have created have just one file: index.html.  **index.html is used in Web Lab to mark the home page of a website**. It will be the first page that loads when someone opens that website. Since you can't have two files with the same name in your project, any other pages you make need to be named something different. Names of html files should be descriptive of what page is. \r\n\r\n** Add directions for adding files once that goes live**\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\nThere is a starting home page as well as a couple other pages provided for you. You will need to add your Guinness Book of World Recods page.\r\n\r\n* Add a new html file where you can copy your Guinness Book of World Records page. Make sure to give it a descriptive name.\r\n* Go to <a href=\"https://studio.code.org/s/csd2/stage/7/puzzle/9\" target=\"_blank\">this level</a> and copy all the code. Paste the code into the file you just created.",
