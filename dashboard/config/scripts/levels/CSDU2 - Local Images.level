The attribute `src` stands for **s**ou**rc**e and tell the name of the image. Image files names include extensions which tell the computer which type of image they are working with. Common extensions are .jpg, .jpeg, .png. \r\n\r\nIn addition to have the src attribute, image elements also have the `alt` attribute which describe the image. This is important in case the image doesnâ€™t load or for people who have trouble with their eyesight.\r\n\r\nAn `<img>` tag is an example of a  **void element** because it starts and closes in one tag. To mark this we put the `/` which usually goes in the close tag at the end of the image tag.\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\nA Dog vs Cat web page has been started for you.\r\n\r\n* The dog image has already been added to the below web page. Use an image tag to add the cat-face.png image to the page below the cat header.",
