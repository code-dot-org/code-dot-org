  console.log(i);
}
```

**Explanation:** Walking through the program line-by-line, paying attention to the value stored in `i`:
* At the start of the for-loop, `i` is initialized with a value of `0`
* The expression `i < 4` evaluates to true meaning the console prints the value currently stored in `i`, `0`
* The value stored in `i` increases by 1, from 0 to 1
* The expression `i < 4` evaluates to true meaning the console prints the value currently stored in `i`, `1`
* The value stored in `i` increases by 1, from 1 to 2
* The expression `i < 4` evaluates to true meaning the console prints the value currently stored in `i`, `2`
* The value stored in `i` increases by 1, from 2 to 3
* The expression `i < 4` evaluates to true meaning the console prints the value currently stored in `i`, `3`
* The value stored in `i` increases by 1, from 3 to 4
* The expression `i < 4` evaluates to false and so the program exits the for-loop and the program ends.
