A robot starts in a grid facing north (B3).  What is the robotâ€™s location and direction after the following program is executed?

    data = ["F", "F", "R", "F", "L", "F", "R", "R", "F"]
    FOR EACH move IN data
    {
        IF ( move = "F" AND CAN_MOVE(forward) )
        {
            MOVE_FORWARD()
        }
        ELSE IF (move = "R"){
          rotate_right()
        } 
        ELSE IF ( move = "L") {
            rotate_left()
        }
    }

Starting off with the robot at B3 and that data = ["F", "F", "R", "F", "L", "F", "R", "R", "F"], let's go through each index of the data:

* "F" - the robot can move forward and is at B2
* "F" - the robot can move forward and is at B1
* "R" - the robot turns right and is facing east
* "F" - the robot can move forward and is at C1
* "L" - the robot turns left and is facing north
* "F" - the robot cannot move forward, nothing happens
* "R" - the robot turns right and is facing east
* "R" - the robot turns right and is facing south
* "F" - the robot can move forward and ends up at C2
