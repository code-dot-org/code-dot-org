# Plan Your Adventure

#### This is the way a plan for Cat Commander would look like. Each rectangle is a different screen. The rectangles and arrows show how the user navigates through the app.

#### Take a minute and decide for yourself

1. What your adventure will be about and who your "hero" or character will be
2. Where your character will start their journey (the first screen)
3. What the first choice or decision your character will need to make (the next two screens)

#### You might want to draw a picture too. Don't worry about getting every detail now. When you're ready, move on to the next level.
