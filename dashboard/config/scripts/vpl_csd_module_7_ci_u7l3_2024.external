</p></div>

## 🌎 Lesson Overview
#### In this lesson students will consider how they create “mental models" when learning new concepts, and how those can be similar to a “machine learning” model. They participate in a color pattern activity to simulate building a machine learning model without help, then they play a game called "Green Glass Door" as an example of supervised learning, and finally, they will sort several scenarios into “supervised” or “unsupervised” learning.

## ✅ Lesson Objective
* #### Describe the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning.

## 📋 Investigation Tasks

* #### Review the lesson plan.
* #### Complete the Green Glass Door activity
