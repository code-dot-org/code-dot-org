question 'The colors of the pixels in a digital image are often represented by red, green, and blue values between 0 and 255 (an RGB triplet). A photographer is manipulating a digital image to lighten it because all of the RGB values in the image are less than 100, making it very dark. He does this by adding 20 to the R, G, and B values of each pixel, then overwriting the original image.  What type of transformation is the photographer using on the digital image?'
right 'Lossless transformation'
wrong 'Lossy transformation'
