# Information

#### There are lots of new key concepts introduced around system prompting that students will engage with during these lessons. Weâ€™ve summarized them below.

#### **Current**: Chatbots only have information up to a certain date. For more recent information, we can add it with retrieval. 
#### **Specialized**: Chatbots tend to have general information about topics. For more specialized information, we can add it with retrieval
#### **Accurate**: Chatbots don't have all the answers and sometimes hallucinate. For situations that require very high accuracy, we can add information with retrieval.

<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 18px; "><strong>Teacher Tip:</strong> Students will eventually be encouraged to spend their time searching for sources and copying directly from them, rather than trying to write retrieval information themselves. This correlates to how retrieval works in a more realistic sense with actual language models: instead of looking at individual words or statements, modern large-language models ingest entire documents or manuals or websites in order to augment their knowledgebase.
