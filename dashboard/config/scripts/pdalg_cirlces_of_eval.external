## Circles of Evaluation

When we met in person you learned about the Circles of Evaluation as a way to write mathematical expressions that moves the focus from computation to literacy

Using the Circles of Evaluation we can translate an arithmetic expression, such as:

    6 * (4 + 5)

To a format that visually demonstrates hierarchy and order of operations.

The visual layout of the Circles of Evaluation is an essential element in helping students understand how to compose complex expressions and functions. We designed our programming language to extend and reinforce the visual metaphor of the Circles, allowing students to work out problems on paper using the circles before programming on the computer.
