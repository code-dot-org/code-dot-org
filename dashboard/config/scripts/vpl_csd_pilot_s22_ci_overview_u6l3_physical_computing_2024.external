# Experiment with Inputs and Outputs

#### The Creating Apps with Devices unit emphasizes the interactions between inputs and outputs on the circuit playground and an app screen. On their circuit playground, students learn to control inputs like buttons or toggle switches and outputs like the buzzer or LED. Students also interact with inputs and outputs in App Lab, such as buttons and text inputs and dropdowns.
