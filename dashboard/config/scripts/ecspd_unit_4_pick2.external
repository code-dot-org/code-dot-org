# Unit 4 Challenge > Choosing an option

Recall that in Stage 4, we introduced the idea of a “challenge” and gave you a set of options for your Unit 4 Challenge. Revisit Stage 4 now if you need a refresher.

The first step in completing your challenge is to choose a lesson from ECS version 5 Unit 4 you’d like to plan and prepare. You can choose a lesson you haven’t taught yet, or one you taught but struggled with. The complete list is below. If you haven’t already, choose a lesson from the list of options. Then click “Continue.” On the next level you will have a chance to share with the group which lesson you've selected.
