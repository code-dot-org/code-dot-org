# Unit Overview

##### Problem Solving and Computing is a highly interactive and collaborative introduction to the field of computer science, as framed within the broader pursuit of solving problems. Students practice using a problem solving process to address a series of puzzles, challenges, and real-world scenarios. Next, students learn how computers input, output, store, and process information to help humans solve problems. The unit concludes with a project in which students design an application that helps solve a problem of their choosing.

## Students will:
* ##### Identify the defined characteristics of a computer and how it is used to solve information problems. 
* ##### Use a structured problem solving process to address problems and design solutions that use computing technology. 
* ##### Create a collaborative classroom environment where students view computer science as relevant, fun, and empowering.
