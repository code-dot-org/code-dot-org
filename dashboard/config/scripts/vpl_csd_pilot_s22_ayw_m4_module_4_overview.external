# Module 4: CS Discoveries Virtual Professional Learning

## Module 4 Overview

##### Modules 3 and 4 the CS Discoveries professional learning program focus on the overarching theme of *assessment*. Both formative and summative assessment are woven throughout the CS Discoveries curriculum to give teachers the opportunity to attune to their students' instructional needs. As a reminder:

* ##### **Formative assessment**: Assessment for monitoring student learning, allowing an instructor to understand where their students are mid-learning and course-correct if necessary. 
* ##### **Summative assessment**: Assessment for evaluating student learning, usually at the end of a lesson to understand what concepts students understood and skills they mastered. 

## How does this asynchronous work connect to the previous synchronous workshop?

##### During the synchronous call, you participated in a two-hour virtual workshop with your facilitators and cohort. This asynchronous work is designed to be an *extension* of that workshop to further your development in assessment. The following levels will build on what was previously introduced to you synchronously. Further, **the asynchronous portion of Module 4 is not a prerequisite for attending and engaging in your Module 5 synchronous workshop**.

##### Both synchronous and asynchronous portions of this module fit together to help develop your skills as a CS Discoveries teacher. Here's how assessment content builds on each other in Module 4:

### Synchronous Work

##### In the synchronous portion of Module 4, you and your cohort:

* ##### Gained a deeper understanding of how rubrics are used in the CS Discoveries curriculum, and
* ##### Calibrated with your cohort on how to define and measure success in CS Discoveries projects by scoring and discussing a sample student project.

### Asynchronous Work

##### In the asynchronous portion of Module 4, you will:

* ##### Review an upcoming rubric or post-project test for an upcoming unit and
* ##### Consider what you'll need to make sure your students are successful in formative assessment.

##### **Suggested time**: 1 hour
