**Content: Unit 5 Lesson 9** - ordering of conditions in else-if

Consider the following JavaScript code segment.  

    var time = promptNum(“What hour is it (on a 24 hour clock)?”);
    var greeting = “”;
    if (time < 6) {
        greeting = "It is too early!";
    } else if (time < 20) {
        greeting = "Good Day!";
    } else if (time < 10) {
        greeting = “Good Morning!”;
    } else {
        greeting = "Good Evening!";
    }
    console.log(greeting);

Something is wrong with the logic in the program above. For which values of time will the greeting “Good Morning” be displayed?

Looking at the two else if statements in the middle, we notice that (time < 20) comes before (time < 10). Since code executes sequentially, "Good Morning" will never be displayed because all values that are between 6 and 10 will first go into the (time < 20) statement due to the order of the code.
