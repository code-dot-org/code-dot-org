# Event-driven programming

App Lab apps work by adding code to respond to certain **events** that occur in a program.  It's App Lab's way of saying "Hey! something just happened!". Your code can then respond to each of these events.

Collectively, the coding tasks involved in making your app respond to events by triggering functions are called **Event Handling**.  

In App Lab all event handling starts by adding a special block of code called `onEvent`.  Here is how to do it:

<br><br>

<div style="column-count: 4; column-gap: 20px; column-rule: 0.5px solid #00adbc; -moz-column-count: 4; width: 100%">

<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #00adbc; font-size: 200%;">1.</span>
Switch into Code Mode</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #00adbc; font-size: 200%;">2.</span>
Drag an <code>onEvent</code> block from the toolbox into the workspace.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #00adbc; font-size: 200%;">3.</span>
Use the pulldown menu to select the <em>ID</em> of the UI element you want to setup to respond to some event. The IDs of all UI elements added in design mode will be listed here.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #00adbc; font-size: 200%;">4.</span>
Use the pulldown menu to select the <em>type</em> of event you want to respond to. (Just use "click" for now).</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #00adbc; font-size: 200%;">5.</span>
Add code inside the function that you want to run <em>when</em> the user triggers the event.  The function will run once every time the user triggers the specific event.</p>

### A small example - move turtle forward on "click"

It's important to understand in Event-Driven programming that:

* **Users trigger events** - Events occur when users click a button, tap the screen, move the mouse, type a key on the keyboard, etc.
* **Events trigger code** - When an event occurs or "fires" it can be used to trigger a particular javascript function.

App Lab's `onEvent` block is a type of event-handling function called an **Event Listener**. It wraps all of the setup up you need to do event handling into one command that has several parts. Here is an example with everything labeled:

<img src="https://images.code.org/a4cf535f00b0b77737d5259386b4442d-image-1476884080311.png" style="display: block; margin: auto">

<div style="column-count: 3; column-gap: 20px; column-rule: 0.5px solid #00adbc; -moz-column-count: 3; width: 100%">

<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #00adbc; font-size: 200%;">1.</span>
Code to execute when callback function is triggered when the user clicks <em>button1</em>.  In this case, simply move the turtle forward 25 pixels. Event handling code will typically be more than one line. This is just a simple example to start.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #00adbc; font-size: 200%;">2.</span>
Notice that this function, unlike others we’ve seen, does not have a name. It is also called a <em>callback function</em> which is an odd term. A callback function is only different from a normal function in that you don't call it directly from your code. Instead a callback function is <strong>called by the system</strong> at the time the specified event occurs. Callback functions are a common pattern in a lot of event-driven programming.</p>
