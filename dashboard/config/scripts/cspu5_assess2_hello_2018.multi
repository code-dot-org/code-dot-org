## *str*.length

In JavaScript you can find the number of characters in String by using `.length`.  For example:
    
    var name = "Victoria";
    console.log(name.length);  // will display 8 - the number of characters in "Victoria"

---

For the next **two** questions, consider the following JavaScript code segment.  

    var word = prompt(“Enter a word”);

    if( word.length > 10){
        console.log(“Wow, big word.”);
    }
    else{
        if( word.length < 3 ){
            console.log(“Did you say something? That was so short.”);
        }
        else{
            if( word.length > 6){
                console.log(“Use that word on the SAT.”);
            }
            else{
                console.log(“I have never heard that before.”);
            }
        }
    }

If the above code segment is run, and “hello” is entered at the prompt, what will be displayed in the console?

**Content: Unit 5 Lesson 6, 8, 9** -- requires incorporating new knowledge about strings, plus nested if reasoning.

Going through the code line by line:

* The variable word is set to "hello", which has a length of 5
* Since the length of the word is not greater than 10, we go into the else statement
* Inside the else statement, since the length of hello is not less than 3, we go into the else statement
* Since the word length is not greater than 6, we go into the else statement where the code displays "I have never heard that before." in the console
