## Unit 2: Lesson 15 - Keys and Passwords

# Background

The more complicated a key is, the harder it is to crack. Encryption algorithms are evaluated based upon the amount of time it would take a computer to crack the key. Vigenère cipher cannot be cracked using frequency analysis; it requires a “brute force” strategy of trying every combination.

# Vocabulary

* **Vigenère cipher** (Vee-zha-nair): a method of encrypting text by applying a series of Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword.

# Lesson

* Write an algorithm for a Vigenere cipher.
* Explain the factors that ensure strong encryption and secure data.
