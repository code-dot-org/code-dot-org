What are some of the advantages of using models and simulations to mimic a real-world process or system under study?
I. Models and simulations mimic real-world events without the cost or danger of real world prototypes or testing.
II. The results of models and simulations may generate new knowledge and new hypotheses related to the phenomena being modeled. 
III. We cannot change the model or simulation as rapidly as we can change the real-world process or system under study, therefore, it allows us to minimize iterations in a model or simulation.

 (A) This option is incorrect. While this option is one of the reasons we generate models and simulations, it is not the only valid reason among the choices given.

 (B) This option is incorrect. While this option is one of the reasons we generate models and simulations, it is not the only valid reason among the choices given.

<hr>
 (C) This option is correct. Both choices I and II are valid reasons for generating a model or simulation but choice III is not valid.

<hr>
 (D) This option is incorrect. Though options I and II are valid reasons, option III is not valid. Generally, it is harder to change a real world system than it is to change a model or simulation.  This means that more iterations could be executed using a simulation or model, not less.
