# Unit 5: Lesson 8 - Boolean Expressions and *if* statements

## Background

In this lesson we move from pseudocode to real code as you write if-statements. You'll learn more about the JavaScript syntax for if-statements and boolean expressions as you get practice with a bunch of small little programs.

## Vocabulary

*   **Boolean** - A single value of either TRUE or FALSE
*   **Boolean Expression** - in programming, an expression that evaluates to True or False.
*   **Conditionals** - Statements that only run under certain conditions.
*   **If-Statement** - The common programming structure that implements "conditional statements".
*   **Selection** - A generic term for a type of programming statement (usually an if-statement) that uses a Boolean condition to determine, or select, whether or not to run a certain block of statements.

## Lesson

* Boolean Expressions and Conditional Operators
* How if-statements work
* How if-else statements work

## Resources
