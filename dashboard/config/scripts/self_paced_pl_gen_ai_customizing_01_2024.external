#### In this lesson, students are presented an overview of the unit and explore the **chatbot lab** for the first time. They learn about the **temperature setting** in chatbots and its influence on the creativity and reliability of responses through hands-on experimentation. Students also explore how chatbots can **hallucinate** and produce incorrect information, monitoring these instances throughout the unit.

Make sure students know where the instructions panel is, can send messages, know how to clear the chat, and know how to copy the chat. Building this fluency early will make later lessons easier.
