#### In this unit, students are going to learn how to use and customize their own chatbot. This chatbot doesn’t use any of the most popular models you hear about in the news, so it’s not perfect and it needs our help to make it better. This will be our main goal in this unit - learning techniques to improve chatbots and models once they’ve already been created.

<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 18px; "><strong>Teacher Tip:</strong> The first lessons in this unit have great opportunities to make sure students become fluent with using the chatbot. Make sure students know where the instructions panel is, can send messages, know how to clear the chat, and know how to copy the chat. Building this fluency early will make later lessons easier.
