#### **In this unit, students will learn how to use and customize their own chatbot using AI Chat Lab**. 

#### The chatbots students are working with are in devleopment, and not finished products like ChatGPT or customer support chatbots on a website. So, they need our help to make them better. 

#### This will be our main goal in this unit - to learn techniques to improve chatbots and models once they’ve already been created.

Make sure students know where the instructions panel is, can send messages, know how to clear the chat, and know how to copy the chat. Building this fluency early will make later lessons easier.
