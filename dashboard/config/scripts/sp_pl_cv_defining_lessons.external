#### In this lesson, students learn to **translate user data** into actionable insights through **visual representations**. 

#### Using examples like robotic vacuum cleaners, students explore how data visualizations can highlight user concerns and inform feature development. 

#### Activities guide them through **creating and interpreting their own visualizations** using tools like Google Sheets, giving them a deep understanding of how visual data can reveal trends and needs within a community.

#### This lesson teaches students to understand user needs and articulate problem statements by constructing user stories from data to insightfully address real concerns.

#### Activities will challenge students to **analyze user behavior patterns** and to think critically about the underlying reasons for these behaviors, using iterative questioning to refine their understanding.

#### By the end of the lesson, students should be able to create **user stories and corresponding problem statements** that guide the development of user-centered solutions.
