This mid-course survey should be administered **after** all class activities have taken place that you intend to teach during the semester. 

You will be able to see the anonymized results of the survey for your students.

Why is this survey here?

* A major goal of CS Principles is to broaden participation in computer science.
* It is crucial therefore to have insight into students' attitudes and beliefs about computer science before, during and after the course so we can measure the change over time.
* Completing it also helps us understand important improvements we can make to the curriculum to improve the teacher and student experience.


* Please help by having your students contribute to this vital dataset. Their voices make the difference!
