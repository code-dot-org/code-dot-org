**Content: Unit 5 Lesson 6, 8, 9** -- requires incorporating new knowledge about strings, plus nested if reasoning.



Going through the code line by line:

* The variable word is set to "goodbye", which has a length of 7
* Since the length of the word is not greater than 10, we go into the else statement
* Inside the else statement, since the length of hello is not less than 3, we go into the else statement
* Since the word length is greater than 6, the code displays “ Use that word on the SAT.” in the console
