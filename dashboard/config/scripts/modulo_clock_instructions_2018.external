# Clock Arithmetic (Modulo)

The kind of “Clock Arithmetic” discussed (officially known as “modular arithmetic”) is a one-way function because you can’t tell what the input number was, just by looking at the clock face.

### Modulo

The mathematical operation **modulo** is the remainder after dividing two whole numbers.

We can visualize this idea as trying to count up to some number using a clock and seeing where the hand ends up.

* For example: if you're trying to count up to 43 on a normal clock with 12 numbers.  
* You are doing: `43 MOD 12`.  
* The result of `43 MOD 12` is: `7`.  Reason: 43 ÷ 12 = 3 **remainder 7**

The clock helps you see another way to think about division - how many times can I count up by 12s until I get to 43 without going over?  12...24...36.   Then how much do I need to add to 36 to make it 43? Answer: 7 - that's the remainder.

# Do this: Experiment with the “Modulo Clock”

* On the next page is a widget that let's you play with this idea
* The widget helps you visualize the result of modular arithmetic
* You can also **make a clock of any size** - you don't have to limit yourself to 12.
* Experiment with different clock sizes and numbers.

## Using the Modulo Clock

You get to set two values - a number and the clock size.  For example if you set number 45 with clock size 37 then 

Try the following for each:

| "Enter a number" | "with clock size..." |
|:-----:|:-----:|
| 45 | 311 |
| 300 | 311 |
| 356 | 311 |

Also try:

* Numbers that are much smaller and **much bigger** than the clock size.
* Try VERY large clock sizes too.

### Modulo Clock Instructions

* You can have students read these instructions or you can **explain modulo** and **demonstrate how to use the widget yourself.**

* There is nothing special about the numbers we suggest using.
* Make sure that students do experiment with small and large numbers for both the input value and clock size.
