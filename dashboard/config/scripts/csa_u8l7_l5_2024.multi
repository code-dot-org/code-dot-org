Consider the following code segment.

```
for (int i = 0; i < list.size() - 1; i++) {
    int minIndex = i;
    for (int j = i + 1; j < list.size(); j++) {
        if (list.get(j) < list.get(minIndex)) {
            minIndex = j;
        }
    }
    int temp = list.get(i);
    list.set(i, list.get(minIndex));
    list.set(minIndex, temp);
}
```

What will be the contents of `list` after three iterations of the outer loop?

teacher_markdown <<MARKDOWN
The outer loop iterates over the unsorted part of the array, from index `0` to `size - 1`. After three iterations of the outer loop, the first three elements of the `ArrayList` will be sorted in ascending order.

However, the remaining elements may not be sorted, as the inner loop only finds the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and places it at the beginning of the sorted part.

The final result will be that the first three elements are sorted in ascending order, but the remaining elements may be in random order.
