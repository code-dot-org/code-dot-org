**Correct answers:**

* Meaningful function names help <em>people</em> better understand programs.
	* Explanation: When a person is reading your program, it will be easier for them to understand what your program does (or is supposed to do) if your functions have clear and descriptive names.
* Functions in programming are a named grouping of programming instructions.

**Incorrect answers:**

* Meaningful function names help *computers* better understand programs.
	* Explanation: It doesn't matter to your computer what names your functions have, as long as you're consistent. Meaninful function names are strictly to make your code more understandable for humans.
* Functions in programming are useful mathematical tools for doing complex computations.
	* Explanation: Functions don't necessarily have to do *complex* computations. Functions can be any set of actions you want the computer to perform.
