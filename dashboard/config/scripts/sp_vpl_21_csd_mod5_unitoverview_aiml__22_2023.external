<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 30px;">The students were so quiet on the first day. They were so intense as they were looking at the screen because artificial intelligence seemed like such a big concept. We are competing with what students have seen in the cinema, on the news, or conversations that they may have had or overheard from others talking about artificial intelligence and all the possibilities of what it will do.  For them being able to dive in and understand it from the fundamental foundational blocks of what AI is, understanding what machine learning is all about, took the mystique out of it for them. They were able to be creative and collaborate and come up with some wonderful ideas. I’m excited about what they are going to do based on what they’ve learned about artificial intelligence and machine learning.
