#Conclusions and Connections 
**Estimated time: 10 minutes**

The calendar below provides a look at the lessons investigated in this module, as well as the model lesson observed in the previous module - Lesson 3: User-Centered Design Micro Activity. Unit 4 concepts build towards cumulative projects at the end of each chapter.  Students use the Problem Solving Process for design throughout the unit with a focus on empathy and the user's needs.
