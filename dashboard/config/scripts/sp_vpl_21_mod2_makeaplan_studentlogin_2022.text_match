## Make a plan for how you will have students log into your Code.org course. 

#### Consider the following when making your plan:

* Do my students already have Code.org accounts? 
* What type of log in will my students use? 
* How will students join my class? 
* Will I have printed instructions? Will the instructions be posted somewhere?
