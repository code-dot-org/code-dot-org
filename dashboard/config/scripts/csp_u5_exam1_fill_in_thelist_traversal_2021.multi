```
var list = [10, 5, 15];

for(var i = 0; <INSERT CODE>; i++){
  console.log(list[i]);
}
```

Which of the following will result in ONLY all the items in `list` being printed to the console if placed where the program reads `<INSERT CODE>` and the program is run?

**Explanation:** All choices except `i < list.length` will result in something other than the just the list of elements in `list` being printed. A will print nothing because `list[3]` is undefined and therefore the code inside the for loop will not execute. C and D will print all the items in ‘list’ followed by some number of ‘undefined’ elements since the variable i increases in value beyond the last index of ‘list’.
