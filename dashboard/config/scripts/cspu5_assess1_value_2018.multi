**Content: Unit 5 Lesson 4**

Solve this problem by going through the lines of code while keeping track of the value of each variable.
It is important to note that if a variable is assigned a new value, the lines of code that reference that variable afterwards also references the new value.

* At the very beginning, a = 3, b = 6, c = 10
* a = b / a which equals  6 / 3 = 2. Thus, variable "a" is changed to the value 2
* _Now, the value of "a" is set to 2_
* b = c - a which equals 10 - 2 = 8. Variable "b" now equals 8
* c = b / a which equals 8 / 2 = 4
* By the end of the program, value of c = 4
