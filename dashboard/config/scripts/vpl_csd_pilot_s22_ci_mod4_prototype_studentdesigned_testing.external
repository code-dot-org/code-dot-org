## Activity overview

* ##### The user is the person who is testing the app in the form of the paper prototype. They should pretend to execute the “app” by pressing on the prototype with their fingers in the way that makes the most sense.
* ##### The user speaks through what they are thinking-out-loud. They can also offer helpful suggestions in our critiquing form with sentences starting with “I like…”, “I wish…”, and “I wonder… “
* ##### The computer reacts to what the user does. If the user tries something that isn’t a part of the app navigation diagram, then the computer doesn’t react.
* ##### The narrator is the person who is running the test. This person will introduce the team members, the app, and its purpose.
* ##### The observers are the other students in the team. They will watch the interaction and write down in their notes what they see the user do in response to the computer. They don’t make any comments themselves - they just take notes.

## Key takeaway

##### A key takeaway from this activity is that students leave with a plan for changes they can make to their app based on their testing. This usually requires setting your ego aside and seeing feedback as opportunities for improvement rather than evidence of failure. Remind students that these are just prototypes, nowhere near the final project. Also remind students not to take feedback personally - that all apps go through this process and they get better because of it.

##### Students may notice that new users discovered new ways to use the app or encountered certain problems they never considered. This can lead to a conversation about bias - because the team was involved in the creation of the app, they may have overlooked different aspects of how the UI is designed or made assumptions about how the user would use it. This is why it’s important to have an outside user test those assumptions early and often.
