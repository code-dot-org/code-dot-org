title 'Check for Understanding: Algorithmic Bias'
description ''
question 'Imagine you are teaching a lesson on digital literacy and ethics in technology to your high school class. During the discussion, a student raises a question about an article they read on algorithmic bias, specifically mentioning a case where a job recruitment tool was found to favor male candidates over female candidates for technical positions due to biases in its training data. As a teacher, how would you respond to this student example of algorithmic bias to enhance the learning experience for the entire class?'

right 'Dismiss the Concern: Suggest that such biases are rare exceptions in the otherwise fair tech industry, and move on to the next topic to avoid any controversy.'
right  'Facilitate a Class Discussion: Encourage the student to share more about what they read, and use this as a springboard for a class discussion on the importance of ethical considerations in technology development, including how biases in society can be reflected and perpetuated by algorithms.'
right 'Assign Homework: Without further discussion, assign homework for students to find and write about another example of algorithmic bias, ensuring the conversation does not distract from the planned lesson for the day.'
right 'Technical Deflection: Shift the focus to the technical aspects of how algorithms are coded, suggesting that understanding code is the best way to prevent bias, without addressing the ethical implications.'
