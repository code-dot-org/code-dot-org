Going through the code line by line:

* The var _a_ is set to the value of 0
* The while loop will run as long as _a_ does not equal 5
* Inside the loop, _a_ is increment by 2 each time 
* However, _a_ will equal 2 on the 1st loop, 4 on the 2nd loop, and 6 on the 3rd loop but it will never equal 5
* Therefore, it will never exit the while loop and instead, an infinite loop is created
