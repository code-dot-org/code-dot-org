Learning Objective: **6.3.1** and Essential Knowledge statements: **6.3.1C**
<hr>
 (A) This option is incorrect. While sharing your email is a privacy concern as it will increase the likelihood of Spam, it is not the greatest privacy infraction of the options.

<hr>
 (B) This option is incorrect. Given that the network is part of the hotel infrastructure, requires a username and password, it is not a major privacy concern unless the hotel IT structure is compromised.

<hr>
 (C) This option is correct. When encrypting files using asymmetric methods, one should always share the public key. If a private key is shared, all files encrypted by this user are able to be able to be unencrypted which is a major privacy risk.

<hr>
 (D) This option is incorrect. Cloud storage itself is not a privacy risk. While one should ensure proper security settings when signing up for any cloud storage, the risk is minimal compared to other options given.
