After students have gotten comfortable working with Event-Based programming and creating UI elements in Design Mode, they have the opportunity to practice and demonstrate their abilities through a short project: the creation of a multi-screen app.  The subject of the app is less important, rather you should focus on making sure they are able to apply the material from the previous lessons.

## The requirements for apps are: 

- The app must have some kind of purpose.
- The app will have **at least 4 screens**.
 - *Students should be comfortable using events to navigate between screens.*
- The app should include **text, images, and buttons** (and optionally sound).
 - *Students will have the opportunity to include multiple events and have them react in different ways through the inclusion of multiple design elements.*
- **No “getting stuck” on a screen.**  It should always be possible to navigate from a screen in the app to some other screen.  The user should also be able to “get back to the start” somehow.
 - *As students begin to make more complicated apps, it is important that they think about their projects in an organized way and plan for a user to want to respond in multiple ways.
- The program code should follow good style, particularly by giving UI elements **descriptive and meaningful IDs**.
 - *Again, because programs increase in complexity it is important to start good habits at an early stage so that students continue these conventions when the code becomes more difficult to follow.
- The user interface should be **intuitive to use**.
