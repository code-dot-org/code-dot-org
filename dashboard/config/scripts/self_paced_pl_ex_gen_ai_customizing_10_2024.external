#### **Question of the Day:** How can you continue to improve AI agents once theyâ€™ve been created?

#### **Lesson Overview:**

#### In this lesson, students are presented an overview of the unit and explore the chatbot lab for the first time. Students begin by exploring a chatbot, using a model card to guide their understanding of its capabilities and limitations. Next they learn about the temperature setting in chatbots and how it influences the creativity and reliability of responses. Through hands-on experimentation, students will adjust the temperature to see its effect on the chatbot's answers. Finally, students explore how chatbots can hallucinate to produce incorrect or misleading information. Throughout the unit, students will monitor and document these instances, enhancing their critical awareness of AI's limitations.

#### **Students will be able to:**
* #### Explain how temperature settings influence the creativity and reliability of chatbot responses
* #### Identify and explain hallucinations in chatbot responses
