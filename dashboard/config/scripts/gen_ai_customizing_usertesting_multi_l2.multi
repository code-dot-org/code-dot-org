## Alice's Recycle Chatbot

#### Alice got a lot of useful data from testing her chatbot with users!

#### One thing people reported is that some of the advice from the chatbot is incorrect - it doesnâ€™t always get it right when something can or canâ€™t be recycled.

#### Now Alice needs to make a decision about what to do with this new information
