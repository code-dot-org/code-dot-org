 (A) This option is incorrect. While the word could have been integer data, there are many other types the word could have represented.  Therefore, this response is not complete.

<hr>
 (B) This option is incorrect. Similar to choice A, while this is a possibility it is not the most complete response.

<hr>
 (C) This option is incorrect. Both of these are possible, but the word could have been other types like String, double or list data.

<hr>
 (D) This option is correct. At a minimum, we would need the preceding type to narrow down how the word should have been interpreted.  Answers I and II give possibilities.  Therefore, all three in combination give the most complete response.
