# Module 2: CSA Virtual Professional Learning

(Estimated time: ~5 minutes)

## Module 2 Overview

Welcome Module 2.  In this Module we will be learning about comparing reference variables and objects using the equals operator (`==`) and the .equals method.  You will notice that there are more videos in this module.  Because each person learns differently and comes in with different experiences, you might find that you use videos differently to learn than you use videos for entertainment.  We recommend re-watching the videos, pausing the videos, and asking yourself questions during the videos to help you process the material. 

**During this asynchronous work you will:**

* Practice programming content related to equality and static methods.
* Reflect on how your students will connect to the content with personally relevant examples.

**After this asynchronous work you will:**

* Understand how to check for equality between objects.
* Be prepared to create a classroom where students can connect to the content with personally relevant examples. 

**Let's get started!**
