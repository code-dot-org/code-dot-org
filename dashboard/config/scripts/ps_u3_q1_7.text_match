Use Top-Down Design strategy to come up with additional functions you may want to create.

**Top-Down Design Strategy:**

1. Look at the big picture…
2. Identify a sub-task…
3. Break down that sub-task into smaller sub-task(s)...
4. Keep going until you’re down to the commands you already have access to.

Here's an example for the first one:

> Function name: drawSnowflake() <br> Description/Justification: Draw a 6 pointed snowflake
