# 2.11 - 15 Lesson Connections

Within the Big Idea of Data, the CSP Framework focuses heavily on how data and information facilitate the creation of knowledge.  Throughout the second half of this unit, students use the computer to manage and visualize data in order to organize it into useful structures that provide a thorough, accurate interpretation of that data into information. At this point students have had opportunities to critically analyze others’ interpretations of data (this is covered in lessons 7 - 10).  In this set of lessons they learn to use tools to make their own visualizations, developing insights about information contained in the raw data that may otherwise be overlooked.  This section concludes with a practice Performance Task which mirrors the format of the Explore PT and prepares students to write not only about their insights, but how and why visualizations they’ve created are best suited to share this knowledge.

## Lesson 11: Making Data Visualizations

**Lesson Type:** External Tools | Individual Skill Building | Tutorial

Students should have come out of the previous section of lessons with the understanding that  visualization is not just about creating a visually appealing chart; it’s about using charts to “tell the story” of what’s really going on in the data. Different charts are more or less appropriate for communicating this story, depending on the data. In this lesson, students explore different chart types, and discover that visualizations are helpful for revealing trends or connections in the data that are too hard to see by just looking at a data table in a spreadsheet. 

This connects to the Explore Performance Task, where students will have to create a visual or audio artifact and explain why the tool they chose to make that artifact was appropriate for telling the ‘story’ of an innovation. Being able to discern which type of visualization is most appropriate for a particular set of data will set them up to be able to address a similar question for the PT.

## Lesson 12: Discover a Data Story

**Lesson Type:** External Tools | Collaborative Artifact Creation | Writing

<a href = “https://curriculum.code.org/csp/unit2/12/” target=_blank> Lesson Plan Link <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"/></a>

Being able to look at large sets of data and use visualization as a tool for discovery is a common task that many people who work with data do on a daily basis. Now that students have spent multiple days looking at data, how it is represented and how that influences its interpretation, and learned how to build visualizations they are prepared to create visualizations with the goal of discovering connections and trends.

## Lesson 13: Cleaning Data

**Lesson Type:** External Tools | Analyzing | Group Skill Building

At this point, students are ready to independently apply some of the data manipulation skills (in spreadsheets) that they’ve learned over the past few lessons, to a new dataset that is relatively uncurated. Because the tools we’re using to visualize data aren’t able to reason through any inconsistencies, cleaning data is an important step in analyzing it, and in many contexts, it may actually take the largest amount of time. This is the beginning of the process of “extracting knowledge from data”: look at the data and clean it up so that you can process it using computational tools.

## Lesson 14: Creating Summary Tables

**Lesson Type:** External Tools | Artifact Creation | Analyzing

<a href = “https://curriculum.code.org/csp/unit2/14/” target=_blank> Lesson Plan Link <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"/></a>
<img src="https://images.code.org/afae9667aa7f127783c1f18caf247ca6-image-1475960939622.png" style="float:right; margin-left:30px; width:200px">

Making a summary (pivot) table is often considered an advanced technique and an extremely powerful computational tool that is available in most spreadsheet software. What’s more, summary tables have a direct tie to the CSP Framework essential knowledge statement: 3.1.3C *(Summaries of data analyzed computationally can be effective in communicating insight and knowledge gained from digitally represented information.).*

Creating a summary table is a good example of making a computational artifact for the Explore Performance Task. For that performance task students might find some raw data while doing research and might create a new artifact that is a summary table of the data that reveals some interesting aspect of it. Using a tool like a spreadsheet to make summary tables let’s you explore data in deep ways, quickly and easily.

## Lesson 15: Practice PT - Tell a Data Story

**Lesson Type:** External Tools | Artifact Creation | Analyzing

This Practice PT reflects many of the practices students will need to use on the Explore Performance Task. For Explore, students will need to create a visual or audio artifact with a computational tool and explain both how it was created and what is revealed through it.  While students will not be required to create a chart or even necessarily visualize data for the PT, creating a data visualization would make for a strong computational artifact. This activity is designed to provide practice with one way to complete that aspect of the PT. Additionally students should leave this Practice PT familiar with many of the Learning Objectives related to the challenges of manipulating and analyzing data, as they will have now gone through the lifecycle of collecting, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data themselves.
