## Unit 3: Lesson 24 - Introduction to Arrays

# Background

We would like to store lists of information in our programs and variables have many shortcomings when it comes to doing so. Most programming languages, including JavaScript, include a list structure of some sort to make it easier to hold many pieces of related information. When used carefully, these can greatly expand the functionality of our apps.

# Lesson

* Learn how to design arrays to hold a variety of information.
* Accessing information in an array by its index.
* Develop a simple application that uses an array.
