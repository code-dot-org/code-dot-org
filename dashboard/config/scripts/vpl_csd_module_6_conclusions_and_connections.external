#Conclusions and Connections 
**Estimated time: 10 minutes**

The calendar below provides a look at the lessons investigated in this module, as well as the model lesson observed in the previous module - Lesson 5: Representing Numbers. Unit 5 concepts build towards cumulative projects at the end of each chapter.  

The unifying concept throughout Unit 5 is the importance of data in solving problems.  Chapter 1 focuses on representing information and Chapter 2 focuses on solving data problems.  The following levels focus on the End of Chapter projects for Chapter 1 and 2 to help us identify what students are working towards and what will be assessed and how.
