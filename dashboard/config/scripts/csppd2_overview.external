## PD Goals

This Online PD will help you ramp up for the start of the school year, and focuses on diving deeper into Unit 1. The best way to build on what you already know about the course is to fill in the holes of where Unit 1 is headed. Understanding the lessons and seeing how they tie together will help you guide your students' inquiry. This experience is designed to help you better understand Unit 1 and prepare to teach the course in the fall.

The lessons of Unit 1 fall into natural groupings based the topics of study, and for this PD we'll look at the lessons in chunks, as outlined below:

For each chunk, you'll review the first page of the lesson plans and experiment with any associated digital tools (or widgets). You'll have a chance to discuss any questions you have about the materials with others who are preparing to teach the course.
