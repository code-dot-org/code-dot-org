# **You just learned "loops"!**  

### **A loop is the action of doing something over and over again.** Another word for doing something again is repeat.

### Loops are really useful for repeating patterns. It might be helpful to write out your program without any loops first, then try to find a pattern. 

### When you see one, stick that pattern into a `repeat` block!
