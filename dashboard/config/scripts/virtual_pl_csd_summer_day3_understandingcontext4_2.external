## To Do:
#### **Step 1:** Look at the Project Assessment. Navigate to the lesson plan for <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/csp1-2021/lessons/12">Unit 1 Lesson 12: Digital Information Dilemmas</a>:
#### - Skim the U1L12 lesson plan.
#### - Skim 1-2 of the articles listed.
#### - Look at the slides for lesson 12.
#### - Review the rubric provided in lesson 12.
#### - Review the exemplar in Code Studio Lesson 12.

#### **Step 2:** Look at the  in <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/csp1-2021/lessons/14/levels/1/page/1?no_redirect=1">Multiple Choice Assessment</a> Lesson 14. Since we did not do all of the lessons, you may not know all the answers. That’s okay. The goal is to see what’s in the assessment at a high level.
