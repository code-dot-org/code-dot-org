###**This survey is anonymous**

* This short survey should take **10 minutes or less** to complete.
* Code.org takes your privacy very seriously.
* Your responses here will be kept **anonymous**.

Your teacher will see the responses for the whole class, but won\'t be able to identify your individual responses.

We do this because we want you to **be as open and honest as possible**. We care about your experience in CSA, and we make improvements based on what you say.
