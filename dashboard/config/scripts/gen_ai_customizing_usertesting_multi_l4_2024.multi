## Eating Disorder Helpline

#### A health and wellness company runs an eating disorder helpline, where you can call in and get counseling to help with issues related to eating disorders. The company has decided to replace the call-in line with an online chatbot instead.

#### Some users are reporting that the chatbot offers the wrong advice and can be cued into suggesting counter-productive strategies that can harm the health and well-being of the user if followed.

#### Given this new information, how should the company respond?
