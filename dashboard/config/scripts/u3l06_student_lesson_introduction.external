## Unit 3: Lesson 06 - APIs and Function Parameters 

# Background

An **API** (Application Programm Interface) is a collection of commands that can be used in a programming language to carry out a variety of processes. These commands are the “interface” that the programmer will use to build applications in that language. 

Some functions have **parmeters** which accept input as a way to better control, and generalize, the behavior of a function.
