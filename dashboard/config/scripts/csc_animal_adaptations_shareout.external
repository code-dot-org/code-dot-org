**Now that you have coded a survival adaptation, it's time to share it out!**

As you view your classmates' projects consider the following questions:

>1. What images and sounds did you see in your classmatesâ€™ time capsules?
>2. How were their stories different from yours?
>3. How were their stories similar to yours?
>4. How did their images make you feel?
