**Now that you have coded a survival adaptation, it's time to share it out!**

As you view your classmates' projects consider the following questions:

>1. Did you choose the same environment scenario or different ones? 
>2. Did they use any of the same coding blocks? 
>3. Do you think the animal would survive the environment change? Why or why not?
