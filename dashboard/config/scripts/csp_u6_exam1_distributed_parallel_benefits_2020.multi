Which of the following is a  benefit of parallel and distributed computing?
MARKDOWN

teacher_markdown <<MARKDOWN
**Explanation:** Since parallel computing allows for programs to be run on lots and lots of computers, they are helpful for solving big problems that you couldnâ€™t normally solve on a single computer.

 [Lesson 5 - Parallel and Distributed Algorithms](https://curriculum.code.org/csp-20/unit6/5/) showed how this happens in a real world example involving the international supercomputing project and protein folding.
 
::: details [**Essential Knowledge Connected To This Question**]

* CSN-2.C.1: Parallel computing consists of a parallel portion and a sequential portion. 

* CSN-2.C.2: Solutions that use parallel computing can scale more effectively than solutions that use sequential computing.

* CSN-2.C.3: Distributed computing allows problems to be solved that could not be solved on a single computer, either because of the processing time or storage needs involved.

* CSN-2.C.4: Distributed computing allows much larger problems to be solved quicker than they could be solved using a single computer.
