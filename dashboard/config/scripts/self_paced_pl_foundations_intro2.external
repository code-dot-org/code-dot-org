#### The **Foundations of Computer Science (FCS) curriculum** is a comprehensive introduction to the vast field of computer science. Designed for high school students, this course integrates fundamental concepts with hands-on practical experience to foster a deep understanding of computing, its capabilities, and its impacts. 

#### The curriculum is structured to align with state requirements and <a href="https://csteachers.org/k12standards/" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CSTA standards</a>, offering a solid foundation in computer science that prepares students for further study and future careers in technology.

## How long will this curriculum take to teach?

#### Foundations of Computer Science is estimated to be completed in seventy 45-minute class periods, or over the course of approximately 14 weeks.

#### You can find the curriculum and all of its supporting materials at <a href="https://studio.code.org/courses/foundations-of-cs-beta-2024" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this link</a>.

## What will my students learn?

#### Foundations of Computer Science is divided into six units:

<summary style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;">üñ•Ô∏è Computer Systems and Devices (16 lessons)</summary>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;">

#### In this unit, students explore the role of physical devices in computing. Using App Lab and BBC micro:bit or Adafruit's Circuit Playground (if available), students develop programs that utilize the same hardware inputs and outputs that you see in the smart devices, looking at how a simple rough prototype can lead to a finished product. There is also a no-device version of this unit available.

<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;">

#### In this unit, students learn about data representation and its role in solving information problems. They explore different systems used to represent information in a computer and the challenges and tradeoffs posed by using them. Students learn what a representation system needs to be useful, and how computers are able to represent different types of information using binary systems.
