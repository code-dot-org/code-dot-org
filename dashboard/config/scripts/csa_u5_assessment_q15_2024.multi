Consider the following method, which is intended to return the element of a two-dimensional array that is closest in value to a specified number `targetValue`.

```
public double findClosest(int[][] numbers, double targetValue) {
  int result = numbers[0][0];
  int difference = Math.abs(result - targetValue);

  for (int row = 0; row < numbers.length; row++) {
    for (int col = 0; col < numbers[0].length; col++) {
      if ( /* missing code */ ) {
        result = numbers[row][col];
        difference = Math.abs(numbers[row][col] - targetValue);
      }
    }
  }

  return result;
}
```

Which of the following could be used to replace `/* missing code */` so that `findClosest` will work as intended?

To replace the `/* missing code */` in the given `findClosest()` method so that it works as intended, we need to determine the condition that checks if the current element is closer to the `targetValue` than the current `result` value.

`Math.abs(numbers[row][col] - targetValue)` calculates the absolute difference between the current element (`numbers[row][col]`) and the `targetValue`.

`difference` represents the difference between the current `result` value and the `targetValue`.

The condition `Math.abs(numbers[row][col] - targetValue) < difference` checks if the absolute difference between the current element and the `targetValue` is smaller than the current difference.

If the condition evaluates to `true`, it means that the current element is closer to the `targetValue` than the current result value. Therefore, the `result` and `difference` variables are updated accordingly.

By using this condition, the `findClosest()` method will correctly update the `result` variable with the element that is closest to the `targetValue` in the two-dimensional array.
