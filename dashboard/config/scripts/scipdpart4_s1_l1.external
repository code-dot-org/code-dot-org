## <i>Phase 3:  Prepare for the Semester 1 Workshop</i>

Welcome to the online prep for your first Phase 3 in-person meetup!

After listening to feedback surrounding your experiences so far, we have developed an online program that is intended to give you additional practice in using models to conduct investigations.

> Note: In order for this PD to be considered complete, you must finish this online PD before your first Phase 3 In-Person meetup.

This online experience is here to help you prepare to use models in your classroom in a broad variety of ways.  During this phase you will practice developing observations and inferences about models, as well as "decoding" them.  Our veteran teachers have found that framing the activity in the context of a "mystery" helps get students get even more excited about figuring out what's going on, and we think you'll enjoy it, too!


To complete these activities you'll need to think back to your CS in Science Phase 2 In-Person PD, and you may want to dust off your StarLogo Nova blocks sheet. Have fun!
