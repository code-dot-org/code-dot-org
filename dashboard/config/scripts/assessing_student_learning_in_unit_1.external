Many of the lessons that use the internet simulator have a combination of application and sense-making questions that cover the the concepts from the lesson available through code studio. There are also rubrics built into the many lessons that can be used to check for understanding. 

## Summative Assessments
On the summative front, there are two types of assessments in unit 1: AP-style and practice performance task. 
<br><br>
The AP-style questions that assess the underlying learning objective, and therefore require students to transfer what they've learned to a new context. These questions were written to expose students to the types of questions they'll need to be able to answer in May on the AP exam. 
<br><br>
The practice performance task is lesson 14, and is modeled off of the Explore PT that students will complete and submit as part of their AP score.
