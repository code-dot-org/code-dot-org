# A Note On Metadata in the Curriculum Framework


Although the term `metadata` is being introduced here with images, students should understand that most file types include metadata.  This is pointed out by the Framework under the big idea of Data:


>- 3.2.1G Metadata is data about data. 
- 3.2.1H Metadata can be descriptive data about an image, a Web page, or other complex objects. 
- 3.2.1I Metadata can increase the effective use of data or data sets by providing additional information about various aspects of that data.


At the end of lesson 3, we suggest asking students what other formats of metadata they’ve seen before.  These may include:

- An internet packet (the packet contains the data that needs to be sent, but also other data like the “to” and “from” address, and packet number).
- The dictionary used to encode text in unit 2 lesson 2. 
- Students may have created metadata when sending numbers across the internet simulator (how many points they were going to send or chunks to expect).


Metadata is also important for web pages.  In addition to the examples listed above, metadata can be used to store a description of the contents of a page or a list of keywords used to describe the page.  These keywords can be used by search engines to determine whether the page is relevant to a user’s search query.
