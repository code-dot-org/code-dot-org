Reflect on the complex adaptive system you identified after watching the Complex Adaptive Systems video. Describe the phenomenon in terms of how you might model it answering the questions posed in the Model Observation Form document.

What is the phenomenon you thought was a complex adaptive system?
<ul>
<li>Who/what are the agents?</li>
<li>What is the environment?</li>
<li>What are the interactions between agents and/or between agents and the environment?</li>
</ul>
