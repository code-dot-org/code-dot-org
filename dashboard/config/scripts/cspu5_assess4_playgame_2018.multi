Consider the _playGame_ procedure below which calls on 3 other procedures: _countFives_, _player1Move_, and _player2Move_.

    PROCEDURE playGame()
    {
        cards = []
        REPEAT_UNTIL ( countFives(cards) >= 5 )
        {
            card1 = player1Move()
            APPEND (cards, card1)
            card2 = player2Move()
            APPEND (cards, card2)
        }
    }

The procedure above simulates a certain card game called “fives” - played with two decks of cards - in which each player takes a turn playing a card, until 5 fives have been played in total, at which point it’s “Game Over.” The procedure uses a list called _cards_ which is initially empty. Each round of play, two cards are appended to the list.

Here is  the _countFives_ procedure.

    PROCEDURE countFives(cards)
    {
        count = 0
        FOR EACH card IN cards
        {
            IF( card = 5 )
            {
                count = count+1
            }
        }
        <MISSING CODE>
    }

Which of the following should replace the &lt;MISSING CODE&gt; at line 12 to make the procedure work as designed?

The purpose of the procedure _countFives_ is to see how many fives are in the deck. A variable in _countFives_ that keeps track of this information is the variable _count_. To send this information to the playGame() function, it has to be returned. Therefore, the missing code is:

	RETURN(count)
