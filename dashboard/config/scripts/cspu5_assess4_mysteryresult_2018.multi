Which of the following best describes the result of running the procedure below?

    PROCEDURE mystery (a, b, c)
    {
        IF ( a >= b AND a >= c)
        {
            RETURN (a)
        }
        ELSE IF ( b >= a AND b >= c)
        {
            RETURN (b)
        }
        ELSE
        {
            RETURN (c)
        }

Looking at the if statements:

* If a is >= (greater than or equal) to b, and a is >= to c, return a
* else if, b is >= (greater than or equal) to a, and b is >= to c, return b
* Otherwise, (implying that c is greater than both a and b) c is returned

This code will return the largest number of the three. It may be helpful to use concrete examples by assigning values to a, b, and c.
