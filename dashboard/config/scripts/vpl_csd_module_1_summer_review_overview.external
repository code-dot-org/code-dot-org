#Review of Concepts from the Summer Workshop

## Overview

During the summer we started to dig into Unit 3: Interactive Animations and Games. We specifically looked at lessons 2, 3, and 4. We we introduced to Game Lab, learned about plotting shapes using a grid, and used parameters to change the size of our shapes. In Module 1, we will continue our exploration of Unit 3 content as we build on the skills we learned over the summer.
