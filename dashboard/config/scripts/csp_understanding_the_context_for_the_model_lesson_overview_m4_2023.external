# Introducing the Concept of Lists

**Goal:** The purpose of this section is to understand how the concept of a list is presented to students in the Code.org curriculum. *(Estimated time: ~55 minutes.)*

## Context
##### In your upcoming synchronous workshop, a facilitator will lead a virtual “Model Lesson” and you will be acting as a learner.  This Model Lesson will be for U6L2 - Lists Investigate.  In preparation for this experience, you should first understand the content that precedes the Model Lesson as well as have a broad understanding of the Unit 6 as a whole.

##### As you do these activities, consider how the content connects between units and anticipate what aspects of this content may be challenging for students.

## Do this: 

##### 1. Read the unit landing page for <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/csp6-2023" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unit 6</a>. Click on the dropdown arrows (see below). This will give you context for the lessons you will in synchronous Module 4.

##### 2. Read the <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/csp6-2023/lessons/1" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">U6L1 - Lists Explore lesson plan</a>.  As you read the lesson plan, match the lesson plan with the slides for the lesson.

##### 3. Watch the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YAJNbeZtgmT8aZyVg9ZI82nxqgknxVuZ/view?usp=sharing" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">U6L1 - Lists Explore video*</a>.  This is found under the “Virtual Lesson Modifications” in the lesson plan. We recommend using the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1i4f64rzZlaL_OxaNtXgfWcdp4hFcWXgsUvBClhTsHyM/edit?usp=sharing" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">digital manipulatives</a> to get a better feel for how students will engage in the concept of a list. (See the note below about the purpose behind this video).

##### 4. When finished with the above tasks, complete the reflection in the next level.

###### **Note**: This video is included as a “Virtual Lesson Modification” for teachers who are unable to teach in person.  If you are able to teach in-person or in a virtual synchronous environment, we do not recommend showing the video to students but rather having students engage with the content in a hands-on way as described in the original lesson plan. Please ignore the references to this lesson being in Unit 5, as our unit ordering has shifted slightly.
