# Teaching Strategies > Teaching the Problem Solving Process

## What’s the problem with problem solving?

Often in school students have seen problem solving processes such as these in very scripted settings. They don't see the problem presented as relevant to their life. One thing that will make this unit more engaging to you and your students is if you can choose problems that are relevant to students lives but also get at the problem solving process. 

> Question: What real world problems can you use to help your students relate to the problem solving process?
