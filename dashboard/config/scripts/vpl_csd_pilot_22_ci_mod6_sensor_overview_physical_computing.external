## Connecting to an LED

##### To connect an external LED to the Circuit Playground, students will need an LED and two wires.

##### 1) Students will need to make sure their Circuit Playground is unplugged from the computer. This helps make sure there isn't any accidental electricity that can damage your board.

##### 2) They will attach a wire so one end is connected to the `A0` pad on the Circuit Playground, and the other end is connected to the positive end of an LED.

##### 3) They will attach a wire so one end is connected to the `GND` pad on the Circuit Playground, and the other end is connected to the negative end of an LED

## How can you tell which end is positive and negative?
##### A standard LED has two wires coming out of the top: a longer wire and a shorter wire. The longer wire is always **positive** and should be connected to a numbered pin on the circuit playground. The shorter wire is always **negative** and should be connected to a `GND` pad on the circuit playground.

##### Some LEDs have the positive and negative sides labeled with a + and -
