# An Introduction to User Stories

*Goal: To understand what a user story is.*

In your summer workshop, you spent time looking at the Unit 3 project. During this module, you will dive deeper into the project and the content. As a reminder, in the Unit 3 project, students use data to help a user solve a problem or get more information.  This project starts with reviewing a **user story**.  A **user story** is an informal explanation of a program feature written from the perspective of the user.  Letâ€™s focus on what a **user story** is. 

Below are 3 of the 5 different user stories students can choose from in the Unit 3 project.  

## Do this:
* Review the user stories below from the Unit 3 project. 
* Write down any similarities or differences between these user stories.

Students select a user story from the ones provided or create their own user story as a starting point for their Unit 3 project.  With this user story in mind, students will develop their own computer program that will help the user featured in the user story.

**Up next:** We will learn more about the role user stories play in software engineering.
