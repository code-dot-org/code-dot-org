Answer:

- A 150 character password that is all the same character. The ease of cracking a password is related to the length of the password. Therefore longer passwords are generally preferred. Picking words from the dictionary can make it significantly easier for a hacker to guess your password. For longer sequences of characters a hacker must simply try every combination of characters of a given length. At 150 characters this is 26^150 if only lowercase letters are used, an unimaginably large number of possibilities and many more than any other option presented.
