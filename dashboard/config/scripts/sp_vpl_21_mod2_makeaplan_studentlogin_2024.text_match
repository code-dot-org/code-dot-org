## Make a plan for how you will have students log into your Code.org course.

#### **Consider the following when making your plan:**

* ##### Do my students already have Code.org accounts? 
* ##### What type of log in will my students use? 
* ##### How will students join my class? 
* ##### Will I have printed instructions? Will the instructions be posted somewhere?
