#### This activity is intended for AP teachers. If you are teaching the course as an AP course, you are going to do a Scavenger Hunt in AP Classroomâ€”the online resource you have access to as an AP teacher. If you are not teaching the course as an AP course, you can participate in the scavenger hunt if you are interested, or we encourage you to finish creating your assessment plan or dig deeper into lessons not covered earlier in the workshop.
