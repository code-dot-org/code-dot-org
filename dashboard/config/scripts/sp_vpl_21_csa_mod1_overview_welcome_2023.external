# Welcome!

## Welcome to the Getting Started Modules for Computer Science A (CSA)

This is a collection of free, self-paced modules designed for educators interested in knowing more about the Code.org platform or getting a head start on learning the basics of Java prior to attending a Summer Workshop.

You decide how you want to engage in each module.  Below is a summary of each module and who it is intended for.  You will also find a summary of each module in the first lesson of each module.

| Module      | Description | Intended Audience     |  Estimated Time  |
| :---        |    :----   |          :---- |          :--- |
| **Module 1:** <a href= "https://studio.code.org/s/self-paced-pl-csa1-2023" >Welcome</a> | <div style="margin: 5px">This is the module you are currently in!  Module 1 is intended to introduce you to Code.org and AP CSA.</div> | <div style="margin: 5px"> Anyone using these professional learning modules for CSA.</div>  |  ~1 hour |
| **Module 2:** <a href= "https://studio.code.org/s/self-paced-pl-csa2-2023" >Navigating Code.org</a>    | <div style="margin: 5px">Module 2 is intended to help navigate Code.org’s set of tools and resources that are included in the curriculum.  In this module you will learn how to find and utilize the lesson plans and teacher dashboard on our platform.</div>| <div style="margin: 5px"> Any teacher who is new to Code.org and the Code.org platform. </div> | ~1 hour |
| **Module 3:** <a href= "https://studio.code.org/s/self-paced-pl-csa3-2023" >Support with text-based programming</a>  | <div style="margin: 5px"> Module 3 introduces the basics of the Java programming language.  In this module you will learn the basic syntax of the language, how to use variables, conditionals, loops and arrays in Java.   This does not replace the material you will learn in facilitator lead workshops, but instead is intended to provide extra support for teachers interested in learning a bit of Java before the workshop. </div> | <div style="margin: 5px"> Any teacher who is experienced in using variables, conditionals, loops and arrays in other programming languages, but is new to Java. </div> | ~6 hours |
| **Module 4:** <a href= "https://studio.code.org/s/self-paced-pl-csa4-2023" >Getting to know the `Painter` class</a>  | <div style="margin: 5px"> Module 4 introduces The Neighborhood which Code.org uses to introduce students to new CS concepts in an approachable and visual way.  Participants will learn about the `Painter` class which is used in The Neighborhood to introduce students to objects and classes. </div> | <div style="margin: 5px"> Any teacher who is familiar with Java OR has done Module 3, but who want introduction to Code.org's tools in CSA. </div> | ~2 hours |


<span style="background-color:yellow"><strong>Note: If you are already familiar with Code.org and the structure of CSA but are new to Java, you may find jumping ahead to Modules 3 and 4 to be most helpful.</strong></span>
