**Modulo:** A modulo is an operation that helps find the remainder of a number. Specifically, given two numbers, x and y, the result of the modulo operation is the remainder after doing *x divided by y*.

General example:

* x%y is read as "x MOD y"
* the remainder after x/y
* y goes into x a certain number of times, and the remaining number is left


For the question choices:

* 9 MOD 8 : 8 goes into 9 one time, with a remainder of 1
* 1 MOD 16: 16 goes into 16 zero times, with a remainder of 1
* 52 MOD 32: 32 goes into 52 once, with a remainder of 20
* 9 MOD 64: 64 goes into 9 zero times, with a remainder of 9

Since 9 MOD 8 and 1 MOD 16 both have a remainder of 1, they compute to the same value.
