Whether you are used to calling them procedures, functions, or subroutines, saving groups of instructions to call repeatedly can be a huge time-saver in computer programming.

To make your hunk of code easier to call from other areas of your program, simply wrap it in a "procedure" block (located in the "Procedures" drawer) and give it a name.  Use the "call" block (also from the "Procedures" drawer) to invoke that code from another place in your program.
