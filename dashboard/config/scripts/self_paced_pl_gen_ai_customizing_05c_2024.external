#### **Question of the Day:** What information should we be providing to potential users of our chatbots?

#### **Lesson Overview:**

#### In this lesson, students are introduced to Model Cards and Foresight in AI charts as tools used to plan for how AI products are used. Students begin by reflecting on what materials are provided to users when we buy a new product, then explore how a Model Card serves a similar purpose for chatbots to clarify and caution how a particular chatbot product should and shouldnâ€™t be used. Then, students explore an example of a Library chatbot and use a Foresight in AI table to examine the intended and unintended users and use-cases for this chatbot. After this example, students create their own model card for a fictitious chatbot, and then analyze each otherâ€™s model cards with a Foresight in AI chart.

#### **Students will be able to:**
* #### Analyze and create model cards for chatbots, including potential intended and unintended uses
* #### Explain the importance of providing safety, transparency, and usability information for chatbots through model cards

#### **Question of the Day:** How can a Model Card help document decisions when making a chatbot?

#### **Lesson Overview:**

#### In this lesson, students explore how to create model cards as they develop their chatbots. Students start by helping a friend design a chatbot to give more specific recommendations using a series of multiple-choice focus questions. Once these decisions are made, students document these decisions on the model card for the chatbot, emphasizing how a model card can also serve as documentation as you make decisions during chatbot development. After doing an example as a class, students choose a new scenario and repeat this process.

#### **Students will be able to:**
* #### Create and document model cards for chatbots, including making strategic decisions about their behavior
