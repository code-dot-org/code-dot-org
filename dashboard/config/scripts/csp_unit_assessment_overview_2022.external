# CS Principles Assessment

Read the information below carefully so that you have everything you need before you start and know how to navigate the assessment.

## Things you need

* **Scratch paper and pencil**
 * There are a few questions for which you might want to do some scratch work on paper.

## How to take the test

* Read each question and select the best answer from the choices provided
* Every selection you make is automatically saved, but you can change it if you want.
* Use the orange buttons "Next Page" and "Previous Page" to go forward and backward in the test. Your responses will be saved whether you go forward or backward.

* You can also navigate using the bubbles at the top of the screen.
    * Yellow - means you've visited a page but haven't answered all the questions yet.
    * Green - means you've answered all the questions on a page.

* When you're ready to submit your test go to the LAST page and you'll see a purple "Submit" button. Once you click "submit" the test is sent to your teacher.

* Note that it is also possible to "unsubmit" your test.  You should **only do this in rare cases** - when you submit the test your teacher sees the time it was submitted.
* **Make sure** you are clear with your teacher that it's okay to unsubmit and re-submit - you don't want your entire test invalidated because you submitted after you were supposed to be done.

### Using these assessments

This assessment is **designed to be in the "style" of the AP** multiple choice assessments but have been written by the Code.org staff. They may in some instances feature language or environments that are specific to the Code.org curriculum.

This assessment is designed to be used in conjunction with the unit project to assess student learning of the objectives in this unit.

#### F.A.Q. -- How to prepare, administer, and review assessments

Please see our running **[F.A.Q. document here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zEpD1PFt6ec2S8ourxuMH0HD6tiyRvqAGUKGDCOt-qs/edit#heading=h.kewgp6z8qdde)** which contains:

* screenshots on how to prepare, administer, and review assessments
* addresses common issues/problems


#### Quick summary of how to see / review student answers

1. Go to your [Teacher Dashboard](https://code.org/teacher-dashboard#/)
2. Select your CS Principles section
3. You'll see a number of purple tabs including Text Responses, Assessments, etc.
4. Click **Assessments/Surveys**
5. From the course selector dropdown, **select the unit that this assessment appeared in (e.g. Unit 1: The Internet)**
6. For all students who have *submitted* their assessment, you will see two tables:
  * The first table is a summary view summarizing the percentage correct from all the students who submitted, including the timestamp they submitted on
  * The second table is a comprehensive list of each answer to each question submitted by each student

    Above both of these tables is a **Download (or export) as csv** button - allowing you to process answers in a spreadsheet (recommended).

7. If you need to allow a student to UNSUBMIT their test, direct the student to navigate to the last page of the test and press "Unsubmit."

**NOTE about UNSUBMITTING:** 

You should make clear rules with your students about unsubmitting a test. Students might think this is a good way to change an answer after the test is over (i.e. cheat) but you'll see a timestamp of when the student submitted the test.  

It's suggested that you simply establish that you will not consider scoring or grading any tests after a particular time.  If it was not submitted before the specified deadline, it's like you didn't receive it.
