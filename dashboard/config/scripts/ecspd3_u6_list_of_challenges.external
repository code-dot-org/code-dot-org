## Don't have robots?

If you don't have robots and aren't able to complete Unit 6 as written, use your challenge time to review the materials posted in stage 4 and make a decision about what you're going to do for the final unit. Keep in mind that whatever you choose to do should provide students with an opportunity to extend on what they learned in units 1-4.
