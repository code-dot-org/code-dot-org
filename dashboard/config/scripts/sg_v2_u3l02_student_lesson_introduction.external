# Unit 3: Lesson 02 - The Need for Algorithms

## Vocabulary

* **Algorithm:** A precise sequence of instructions for processes that can be executed by a computer and are implemented using programming languages.  (NOTE: this is the definition from the AP CS Principles framework).
* **Low level programming language:** A programming language that captures only the most primitive operations available to a machine.  Anything that a computer can do can be represented with combinations of low level commands.
* **High level programming language:** A programming language with many commands and features designed to make  common tasks easier to program.  Any high level functionality is encapsulated as combinations of low level commands.

## Lesson

* Write instructions to find the smallest card in a row of playing cards
* Compare solutions with classmates and come up with the mimimal set of instructions needed to do this
* Define a "human machine language" for this task and implement your algorithm with it.
* Test out and refine your algorithm
