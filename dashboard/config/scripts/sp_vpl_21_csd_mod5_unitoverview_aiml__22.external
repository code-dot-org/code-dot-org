# Introduction

#####  AI and machine learning impact our entire world, changing how we live and how we work. That's why it’s critical for all of us to understand this increasingly important technology, including not just how it’s designed and applied, but also its societal and ethical implications. Code.org's AI and Machine Learning unit focuses on AI ethics, examines issues of bias, and explores and explains fundamental concepts of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

##

* ##### **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** - when a machine acts in ways that mimic human intelligence such as playing a game, creating works of art, having a conversation, performing routine tasks, or solving problems. 

* ##### **Machine learning** - how computers recognize patterns and make decisions without being explicitly programmed.

<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 30px;">The students were so quiet on the first day. They were so intense as they were looking at the screen because artificial intelligence seemed like such a big concept. We are competing with what students have seen in the cinema, on the news, or conversations that they may have had or overheard from others talking about artificial intelligence and all the possibilities of what it will do.  For them being able to dive in and understand it from the fundamental foundational blocks of what AI is, understanding what machine learning is all about, took the mystique out of it for them. They were able to be creative and collaborate and come up with some wonderful ideas. I’m excited about what they are going to do based on what they’ve learned about artificial intelligence and machine learning.
