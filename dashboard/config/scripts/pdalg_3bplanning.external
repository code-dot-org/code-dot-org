# Getting Started > Planning your participation

Before you begin, take a moment to consider your learning needs, goals and the unique experience of learning in an online, self-paced environment &mdash; especially if this is your first online course!

## You’re the Boss

This self-paced online course is designed to put you in the driver’s seat, and give you control over your own learning. Self-directed learning is a core principle of [Code.org’s Professional Development philosophy](https://code.org/educate/professional-development-philosophy). 

**Please take your time and work through this course at your own pace.** If you find yourself spending more or less time on a given stage, don’t worry! Our main goal is for you to have fun, learn the basics, and apply what you learn in your classroom practice in whatever way works best for you.

## Get Connected

One way to help stay motivated and focused throughout your learning is to get active in [our Professional Learning Community (PLC) forum](http://forum.code.org/c/cs-in-algebra). [Start by introducing yourself there in our “Introductions” thread](http://forum.code.org/t/introductions-meet-and-greet/2175). Throughout the course, you’ll use the forum to asynchronously share your thoughts, takeaways and questions with others who are also working through the content.

## Finding Help When You Need It

If you get stuck at any time during the course, head over to [support.code.org](http://support.code.org) and check out [our Community forums](https://support.code.org/hc/communities/public/topics). You’ll likely find the answer to your question there. If you don’t or are still stuck, you can email [support@code.org](mailto:support@code.org) and someone will get back to you as soon as we can. 

## Buddy up!

Keep in mind that we are a small team and due to the scale of our efforts, we can’t respond to all requests for support in the same way an instructor could for a face-to-face course. For that reason, we encourage you to work through this online course with a partner or group of colleagues. Code.org recognizes the power of peer learning and collaboration. In fact, Peer Programming is a great industry practice we’ll explore in Stage 8 as a possible classroom best practice. If you feel you’ll learn better with a partner or in a group, why not complete the course with a buddy or a colleague? If you don’t know anyone in real life who’s interested in partnering with you, head over to [the PLC forum](http://forum.code.org/t/never-swim-alone-the-find-a-buddy-thread/411), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/teachcode) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1457214714576953/) and find someone from the code.org community who might want to collaborate.
