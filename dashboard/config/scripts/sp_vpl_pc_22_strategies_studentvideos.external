## Pair Programming 

##### Consider having students complete Skill Building levels in pairs using Pair Programming, which has students use one computer and trade between being a Driver or a Navigator. This process is highlighted in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7d_JtyCq1A" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this video</a> , which you can show to the class. You can have students switch roles based on a timer, or switch every time they complete a level.

## Debugging

##### We recommend normalizing bugs and mistakes as something that happens to everyone - itâ€™s just part of the process. 

##### You can show students our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auv10y-dN4s" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Student video</a>, which includes several students normalizing mistakes and discussing debugging strategies that students can use. Additionally, consider displaying the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MCM3GSspnR6Yq44pXx_OGgQJetVS9-UIiQQwtiKuDMY/view" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Student Guide to Debugging</a> for students to reference throughout the unit and having <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M6mnq73DfyvzasucVAwfL-gjl2JqVPzjy_fRx5j4j7c/view" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bug Report Quarter Sheets</a>  available for students to use.

## Teamwork 

##### If students are working in pairs or small teams to complete projects, consider showing these two videos to the class:

##### - <a href="https://youtu.be/qkw4pDV5Lec" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How Teamwork Works</a>

##### -  <a href="https://youtu.be/6GgrUeVT-xs" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dealing with Disagreements</a>

##### Depending on your goals with the project, consider having teams complete a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pfwrtSLjj1LCqneR_lmyUfw2z0UkkWSXTq48AxuIhyo/view" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Student Guide to Team Planning</a>, which reinforces the message in the video.
