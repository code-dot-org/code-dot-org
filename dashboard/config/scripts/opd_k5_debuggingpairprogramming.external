**Debugging** is an essential skill and process in computer science.  

**Pair programming** is a technique used in the real-world in which two programmers work together on one computer.  

Both debugging and pair programming are CS teaching strategies built into the student learning platform. 

## Debugging 

### CS Concepts

* **Bug:** Something that is going wrong with the code, an error.
* **Debugging:** Finding and fixing “bugs” or the code to fix an error.

Debugging is a skill each individual student will need to practice, strengthen overtime, and practice while coding.

Debugging is also a process that students can engage in, as a learning community, to practice problem solving, collaborating, and communicating.  As a class, students can reflect on thinking about how to debug.

### Learning Platform Features

##### Watch this video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUZTRNakV9c" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Debugging with the Step Button</a>, that introduces students to features built into the student learning platform to help students debug programs.

## Pair Programming

Pair programming is a technique in which two programmers work together at one computer.  The "driver" writes code while the "navigator" directs the design and setup of the code.  The two programmers switch roles often.  Students in Computer Science Fundamentals courses engage in pair programming throughout many lessons.
