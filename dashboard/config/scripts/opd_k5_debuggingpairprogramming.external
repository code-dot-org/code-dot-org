**Debugging** is an essential skill and process in computer science.  

**Pair programming** is a technique used in the real-world in which two programmers work together on one computer.  

Both debugging and pair programming are computer science teaching strategies built into the website as features. 

## Debugging 

### CS Concepts

* **Bug:** Something that is going wrong with the code. An error.
* **Debugging:** To find and fix errors.

Debugging is a skill each individual student will need to practice, strengthen overtime, and practice while coding.

Debugging is also a process that students can engage in, as a learning community, to practice problem solving, collaborating, and communicating.  As a class, students can reflect on thinking about how to debug.

### Learning Tools and Website Features

##### Watch this video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUZTRNakV9c" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Debugging with the Step Button</a>, that introduces students to features built into the website to help students debug programs.

## Pair Programming

Pair programming is a technique in which two programmers work together at one computer.  The "driver" writes code while the "navigator" directs the design and setup of the code.  The two programmers switch roles often.  Students in Computer Science Fundamentals courses engage in pair programming throughout many lessons.

##### Watch this video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q" target="blank"> Pair Programming</a>, that introduces pair programming to students.

### Pair Programming - **Teacher Side**

Follow the instructions below to turn on pair programming for your students using the teacher dashboard.  Refer to <a hrer="https://levelbuilder-studio.code.org/s/k5-onlinepd-2021/lessons/2/levels/2" target="blank" >Lesson 2: Getting Started</a>, of this online course for help with using the teacher dashboard.

<a href="https://studio.code.org/home" target="blank" > **1. Sign-in to your Code.org account.**</a>

**2. Click on "My Dashboard," scroll down to the classroom section you want to turn pair programming on for, and click on that section.**

### Pair Programming - **Student Side**

Students will need to follow the instructions below to pair program with up to four other students in the same class section.

**Note:**  Pairing for students depends on one of the following login types you chose for you class section:

1. Class section login type with secret word/picture based passwords.
2. Class section login type with personal email, Google Classroom, and Clever.

### 1. Secret Word/Picture Based Password Sections

Students will see the images below when they log into your class section.  If a student checks "I have a partner at my computer" and then signs in, they will be given the option to choose a partner.

### 2. Secret Word/Picture Based Password Sections

Students will see the image below when they log into your class section.  Students can select a partner after signing in by clicking on the top-right corner of their page and selecting "Pair programming" from the drop down menu shown below.
