You’ve made your way through the majority of the content for this course. Congratulations! In Stage 1, you reviewed the course information. In Stage 2, you explored computer science as a discipline. In Stage 3, we preapred to master the basics of computer science in Stages 4-7, playing the role of the student yourself. Now, let’s transition to an exploration of how you might teach what you’ve learned to young people
<br><br>
By completing Stage 10, you will:

- Review best practices for teaching computer science
<br><br>

>## Looking ahead:<br>
The best practices we will cover in this stage include:

>- Establishing a positive classroom culture that supports self-directed learning, experimentation and failure
- Knowing when and how to apply instructional design strategies from other subject areas
- Using strategic grouping strategies such as "pair programming"
- Explicitly teaching meta-cognitive problem solving strategies
- "Unplugging" and teaching some core concepts with minimal or no technology
- Other best practices suggested by [the code.org teacher community](http://teacherblog.code.org)

<br><br>
We'll also provide an opportunity for you to share your best practices with our community.
