**You’ve made your way through the majority of the content for this course. Congratulations!**   

In Stage 1, you reviewed the course information.  
In Stage 2, you explored computer science as a discipline.  
In Stage 3, you prepared to master the basics of computer science.  
In Stages 4-7, you played the role of the student yourself.  
Now, let’s transition to an exploration of how you might teach what you’ve learned to young people.  


By completing Stage 10, you will:

- Review best practices for teaching computer science

> ## Looking ahead:
> The best practices we will cover in this stage include:

>- Establishing a positive classroom culture that supports self-directed learning, experimentation and failure
- Knowing when and how to apply instructional design strategies from other subject areas
- Using strategic grouping strategies such as "pair programming"
- Explicitly teaching meta-cognitive problem solving strategies
- "Unplugging" and teaching some core concepts with minimal or no technology
- Other best practices suggested by [the Code.org teacher community](http://teacherblog.code.org)

We'll also provide an opportunity for you to share your best practices with our community.
