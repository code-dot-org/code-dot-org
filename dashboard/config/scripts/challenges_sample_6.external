            Include additional copper strips

            To make the solution appear to change to blue...Rather than 3 new copper hydrate breeds, use the color trait and nested logic (if and if/else statements) in the collision block for water & copper nitrate to change the color from cyan to sky blue to blue
            <br/><br/>
            <i>Details: Create a new trait that is then incremented with each collision between copper hydrate and water</i>

				Make your model such that a minimum amount of water is required in order for the reaction to occur, silver nitrate is at the bottom until a ‘stir’ procedure is added.
            <br/><br/>
            <i>Details: In the setup, use logic to check for a minimum level of water.  If it has enough water (perhaps 200) then the silver nitrate will scatter, if there is not enough water, the silver nitrate will be on the bottom</i>
