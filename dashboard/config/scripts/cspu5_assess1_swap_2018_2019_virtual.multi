Jose is writing a reply function for a text messaging app.  Heâ€™d like to swap the sender and receiver so that the value currently in variable _From_ ends up as the value in _To_ and _To_ ends up in _From_

Which of the following code segments will correctly swap the values as described?

**Content: Unit 5 Lesson 4**

General idea: a temporary variable must be made to contain one of the existing information before switching the variable information. Switching `to = from` and then `from = to` is incorrect because both variables would then have the value`from`.

* A `temp` variable is created and points to one value, `from`
* Since `from` value is stored within `temp`, it is safe to write `from = to`
* `to` needs to point to the value of `from` BUT cannot be `to = from` because at this point, `from` stores the value of `to`
* Therefore, `to = temp` because `temp` holds the original value of `from`

Note:

* It may be helpful to draw out boxes containing "Bruce Wayne" and "James Bond", and change the arrows "from", "to", and "temp" to visualize the problem.
* Optional: For further understanding, read up on the term "reference semantics"
