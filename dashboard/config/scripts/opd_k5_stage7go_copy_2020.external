# Unplugged Lesson: The Big Event

> An **event** is a line of code that tells your computer to "listen" for something to happen, then take an action. For example, on web pages, you often can display a drop down menu when you roll over the navigation bar with your mouse. The "mouse rollover" is an event that triggers an action.

***
## **1. Review "<a href="https://curriculum.code.org/csf-19/coursec/14/" target="blank">The Big Event</a>" Lesson Plan from Course C.**
<br/>
Course C is meant for students in Grade 2. Events come up in every CS Fundamentals Course, from A-F.
<br/><br/>

## **2. Watch the student video: The Big Event (found in lesson plan)**
This is a video that you would show your students to help introduce the concept of events and kick off the unplugged lesson.
