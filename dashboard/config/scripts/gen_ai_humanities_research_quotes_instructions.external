Are these quotes real? What about the stated author - did they actually say that statement?

1. Read each quote and write down your initial thoughts about whether it is real and whether the person in the image said it.
2. Use your research skills to determine if you are correct and verify whether the quote is real and who said it.
3. Document how you know if you were right or not.
