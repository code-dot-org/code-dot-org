# The Internet - Web Development: Lesson 1 - Quality Websites

## Background

Every website has a purpose, a reason someone created it and others use it. In this lesson, students will identify the purpose of a website and the key features of a website that can help it achieve its purpose. Students will break up into pairs to analyze a set of websites with a common purpose. Students will decide if the websites achieve their intended purpose and give reasons for why. Using the reasons why, the class will have come up with a list of features that influence if a website meets its purpose.
