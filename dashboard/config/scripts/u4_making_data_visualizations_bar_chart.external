# Making a Bar Chart

In this exercise, you will use some different columns in the spreadsheet to create a **bar chart**. Bar charts are useful for viewing data grouped by different categories.

---

## Select Data

**Do This:** Select the **“age,”** **“number of women,”** and **“number of men”** columns

* Select the first column of data using the mouse
* Hold down the **"Control"** key, (or **"Command"** on a Mac) and select the additional columns of data

<details>
<summary>Using Hotkeys</summary>
<span>To select cells in non-adjacent columns you can also use hotkeys:</span>
<ol>
<li>Select the cells from the first column (i.e., A1 through A62) using the <strong>SHIFT+click</strong> combination.</li>
<li>Hold down <strong>COMMAND</strong> (if using a Mac) or <strong>CONTROL</strong> (if using Windows) and click to select the first cell of the next column (i.e., E1).</li>
<li>Hold <strong>COMMAND/CONTROL</strong> **and** <strong>SHIFT</strong> simultaneously, then click to select the last cell in the new column (i.e., E62).</li>
<li>Repeat steps 2-3 for any additional columns you want to select (i.e., G1 through G62).</li>
</ol>
</details><br>

*Change chart type and insert your bar chart into the spreadsheet.*

## Do a Visual Check

At this point, your chart should look something like this:

Once your chart looks close to the one above, switch to View mode and take a moment to look at your visualization.

* What does this chart help you notice about the data?
* For which ages were the number of ratings similar between men and women?
* For which ages were they different?
* What other connections and trends can you see from this chart?

After you’ve thought about these questions, move on to the next section to learn how to further customize your chart.
