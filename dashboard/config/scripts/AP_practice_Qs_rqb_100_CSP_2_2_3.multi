Learning Objective: **2.2.3** and Essential Knowledge statements: **2.2.3E**
<hr>
 (A) A byte is made up of 8 bits, therefore, this cannot be correct.

<hr>
 (B) A word is made up of multiple characters, which are each represented in the ASCII system by 8 bits.  Therefore, a word must be larger than a bit.

<hr>
 (C) A word is made up of multiple characters, which are each represented in the ASCII system by 8 bits.  Therefore, a word will require more than 8 bits, or 1 byte.

<hr>
 (D) This is correct. A byte is made up of 8 bits.  A word is made up of multiple characters, which are each represented in the ASCII system by 8 bits, or 1 byte.
