Consider the following class definition

```
public class Book {

  private double cost;
  
  public double getCost() {
    return cost;
  }

  // There may be instance variables, constructors, and methods not shown.
}
```

The following method appears in a class other than `Book`. It is intended to sum all the `cost` instance variables of the `Book` objects in its `ArrayList` parameter.

```
/** Precondition: bookList is not null */
public static double getTotal(ArrayList<Book> bookList) {
  double total = 0.0;
  /* missing code */
  return total;
}
```

Which of the following can replace `/* missing code */` so the `getTotal` method works as intended?

I.
```
for (int x = 0; x < bookList.size(); x++) {
  total += bookList.get(x).getCost();
}
```

II.
```
for (Book b : bookList) {
  total += b.getCost();
}
```

III.
```
for (Book b : bookList) {
  total += getCost(b);
}
```
