Painter myPainter = new Painter();

myPainter.turnLeft();
myPainter.turnLeft();
myPainter.turnLeft();

myPainter.move();
myPainter.turnLeft();

myPainter.move();
myPainter.takePaint();

teacher_markdown <<MARKDOWN
In this example, the `Painter` object first calls the `turnLeft()` method three times. This will not result in an error. However, the next command requires the `Painter` object to move forward one space using the `move()` method. If there is an obstacle in front of the `Painter`, calling `move()` will result in an error.
