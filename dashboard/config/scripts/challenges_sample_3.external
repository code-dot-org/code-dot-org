            Have predator chase the prey, prey runs away, herbivore can find the grass
            <br/><br/>
            <i>Details: Use logic (if else) to adjust the movement so that the predator can detect in a certain distance the prey and moves toward it, prey detects the predator and runs away, herbivore can detect where the grasses are</i>

            Add competition- organism at the same trophic level competes for habitat and/or resources
            <br/><br/>
            <i>Details: Add a new breed with similar behaviors as its competitor  
            Plant competition- use detection and logic to prevent the original grass from landing nearby to reproduce  
            Herbivore competition- add another breed that eats the same resources but has slightly different behaviors</i>

				Create animals that are territorial and can only travel in certain places on Spaceland
            <br/><br/>
            <i>Details: Use terrain colors and a new trait to have the breeds identify where their territory is (or isnâ€™t) Use logic to keep them in this area</i>
