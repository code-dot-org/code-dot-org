# Unit 4: Lesson 8 - Rapid Research - Cybercrime

## Background

Learn about various types of cyber attacks and cyber crimes and do a small amount of research to learn more about one. The lesson caps off learning about encryption by taking a moment to look at the kinds of attacks and threats encryption (among other things) is intended to thwart.

## Vocabulary

* **Antivirus Software** - usually keeps big lists of known viruses and scans your computer looking for the virus programs in order to get rid of them.
* **DDoS Attack** - Distributed Denial of Service Attack. Typically a virus installed on many computers (thousands) activate at the same time and flood a target with traffic to the point the server becomes overwhelmed.
* **Firewall** - software that runs on servers (often routers) that only allows traffic through according to some set of security rules.
* **Phishing Scam** - a thief trying to trick you into sending them sensitive information. Typically these include emails about system updates asking you send your username and password, social security number or other things.
* **SSL/TLS** - Secure Sockets layer / Transport Layer Security - An encryption layer of HTTP that uses public key cryptography to establish a secure connection.
* **Virus** - a program that runs on a computer to do something the owner of the computer does not intend.

## Lesson

* Watch Video - Cybersecurity & Crime
* Read *How Not to Get Hacked*
* Reseach a cybercrime event
* Complete a one-pager presenting your findings
* Review cybersecurity terms
