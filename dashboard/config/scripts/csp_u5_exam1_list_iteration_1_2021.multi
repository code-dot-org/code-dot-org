markdown <<MARKDOWN
`ageList` and `gradeList` contain information about students in a classroom. A programmer has already written the following code with that information.

```
var ages = [16,17,18, 17];
var names = [“Beni”, “Analise”, “Ricardo”, “Tanya”];

var filteredNames = [];
var age;
```

Which of the following programs will result in filteredNames only containing the names of students who are 17 or older?
