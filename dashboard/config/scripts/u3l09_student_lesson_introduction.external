## Unit 3: Lesson 09 - Scene Design Part 1: Plan 

# Background

Breaking down complex programming tasks is useful not only because it makes solutions easier to conceive of, but because it allows multiple programmers to work on the program at the same time. In this project you will use this principle to collaborative develop your own digital scene.

* Identify the major components of your digital scene and assign them to individual group members
