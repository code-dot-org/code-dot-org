Consider the following code segment, where letters is a two-dimensional (2D) array that contains
possible letters. The code segment is intended to print "DOG" using column-major order.

```

String[][] letters = {{"D", "O", "G"},
                      {"O", "O", "-"},
                      {"G", "-", "G"}};

System.out.println( /* missing code */ );

```
Which of the following could replace `/* missing code */` so that the code segment works as intended?
