# Making Pivot Tables Part 2 - Manipulation and Visualization

## Adding Columns

Let's look at two more features of pivot tables that will allow you to do more complex investigations of your data.

We learned that a **Row** in a pivot table specifies an **aggregation** or grouping of items for which you want to compute a value. A **Column** in a pivot table is just **another aggregation,** but it displays the values across the top of the table. It's easier to understand when you see it...

**Do This:** Add columns that group your data by **gender**, as in the animation below.

*Adding columns grouped by gender. The resulting table shows the average rating and count for each movie, but also broken down by gender.  The pivot table also preserves the "Grand Totals" which is what the data would look like if no columns were specified.*

## Filtering Pivot Tables

Applying a filter to a pivot table does the same thing as it does in the normal spreadsheet - it allows you to filter out values from the raw data.

The animation below shows first filtering out 14-year-olds from the calculations, and then filtering out some of the movies. **You don't have to do this**, but in some instances it can be a very useful tool.

## The Next Step - Manipulating the Pivot Table

If you want to maninpulate the data further, to sort or filter, **you shouldn't do it in the live, active pivot table**.  Instead you should **copy the table**, and **paste the values** into a new spreadsheet.

**Note:** "Paste Values" is not the same as a normal "Paste". 

**Do This**: Copy the pivot table, create a new tab in the spreadsheet and do **Edit** -> **Paste special** -> **Paste *values* only**. Watch the animation to see how.

*Copying a pivot table, making a new tab in the spreadsheet, and pasting values.*

**"Why *Paste values only* instead of just *Paste*?"**

1. If you copy a pivot table and do a normal paste it will paste another copy of the *active, live, responsive* pivot table into a new tab.  We don't want the active table; we just want the values it produced.
    
2. You probably want to add/change column headings to display the table, **especially to use it for charting**.  See the image below for how you might do this.

*Changing column names to make them easier to read for a chart*

From cleaning that up, plus some filtering we can make a chart of movies where the differences between male and female ratings are significant.

## Moving on: Visualizing Summary Tables
**A summary table can be a good first step toward a great visualization**. You often want to **summarize data first, then chart it**, so you can see larger connections or patterns.

Summary tables also don't have to be small!  You might make a summary table that is still too big or full of numbers to see any trends in the data.
    
For example, from the original movie rating data (which had roughly 65,000 records) if you make a pivot table that shows the **average movie rating for every possible age group** the table will be about 75 rows long with a whole bunch of decimal numbers.  

You can't see any trend or pattern in the data just by looking at the table.  But if you plot the results on a graph you can!
    
| Summary Table | Chart |
|:-------------:|:-----:|

**NOTE:** *A deeper investigation of the data shows that the number of movies rated by people at this web site declined steadily after age 28.  The upward trend may be affected by the fewer number of ratings.*
