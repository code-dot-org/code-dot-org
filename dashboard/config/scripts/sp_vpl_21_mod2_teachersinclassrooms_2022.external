> ##**Curriculum Value:** Teachers in Classrooms
We believe students learn best with the help of an empowered teacher. **We design our materials for a classroom setting and provide teachers robust supports that enable them to understand and perform their critical role in supporting student learning.** Because teachers know their students best, we empower them to make choices within the curriculum, even as we recommend and support a variety of pedagogical approaches. Knowing that many of our teachers are new to computer science themselves, our resources and strategies specifically target their needs.
