# Connect with CS Educators

#### During this workshop, you have had the benefit of peers to share experiences with and brainstorm ideas for teaching CS Discoveries. Unlike math, science, and language arts teachers, many computer science teachers are the only teachers that teach computer science in their building. Similarly, school wide professional development opportunities rarely focus on developing specifically as a CS teacher. These realities make it especially important for computer science teachers to be creative in developing a support network of CS educators to learn from and grow with.

#### **Professional Learning Community (PLC)** - a group of educators that collaborate, share ideas, and grow together
