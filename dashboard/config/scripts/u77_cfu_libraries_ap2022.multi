## Practice Question

The following procedure was developed to determine if a list contains a negative number. If the list contains a negative number it should return true, otherwise it should return false.

An error was made in writing this function so that it does not work as intended. Which line of code would need to be fixed in order for the function to work as designed?

```
01 PROCEDURE checkNegative(list)
02 {
03  hasNegative <- true
04    FOR EACH number IN list
05    {
06      IF(number < 0)
07      {
08        hasNegative <- true
09      }
10    }
11  RETURN(hasNegative)
12 }
```
MARKDOWN

teacher_markdown <<MARKDOWN
Since line 03 sets the value of `hasNegative` to `true` before the loop goes through each number in the list, there is no way for this function to return `false`. The presence of a positive number in the list will not change the value of `hasNegative` to false. In order for this function to return `false` when a list with positive numbers is passed into it, the starting value of `hasNegative` should be set to `false` instead of `true`.
