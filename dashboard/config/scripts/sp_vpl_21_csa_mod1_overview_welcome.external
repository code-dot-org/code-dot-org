# Welcome!

## Welcome to the Getting Started Modules for Computer Science A (CSA)

This is a collection of free, self-paced modules designed for educators interested in knowing more about the Code.org platform or getting a head start on learning the basics of Java prior to attending a Summer Workshop.

You decide how you want to engage in each module.  Below is a summary of each module and who it is intended for.  You will also find a summary of each module in the first lesson of each module.

In this module you will learn the basic syntax of the language, how to use variables, conditionals, loops and arrays in Java.   This does not replace the material you will learn in facilitator lead workshops, but instead is intended to provide extra support for teachers interested in learning a bit of Java before the workshop. </div> | <div style="margin: 5px"> Any teacher who is experienced in using variables, conditionals, loops and arrays in other programming languages, but is new to Java. </div> | ~7.5 hours |
