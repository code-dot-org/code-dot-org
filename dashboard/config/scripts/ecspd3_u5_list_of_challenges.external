# Unit 4 Challenge Options

See below for the list of challenge lessons. Feel free to click through to the lesson plans and explore the materials so you can select one to complete. **Your goal right now is to pick the lesson that you will complete later.**

As you check out the lessons and choose a topic, focus your energy on material that's new to you, and do as much as you feel you need to do to understand the concepts, give suggestions about how to teach the lesson, and create an assessment or extension activity.
