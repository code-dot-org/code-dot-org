Consider the following method, `reverse`, which is intended to return the reverse the elements of `arr`. For example, if `arr` contains `{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}}`, then `reverse(arr)` should return `{{6, 5, 4}, {3, 2, 1}}`.

```
public static int[][] reverse(int[][] arr) {
  int[][] ret = new int[arr.length][arr[0].length];

  for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < arr[0].length - 1; j++) {
      ret[i][j] = arr[arr.length - i - 1][arr[0].length - j - 1];
    }
  }

  return ret;
}
```

The code does not work as intended. Which of the following arrays can be passed to reverse to show that the method does NOT work as intended?

If we pass the array `{{1, 0}, {1, 0}}` to the `reverse` method, it should return `{{0, 1}, {0, 1}}` if the method is working correctly. The other four answer choices are palindromes -- a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward. Therefore, if we were testing, it would be difficult to tell that the `reverse` method is not actually reversing the array using the other four answer choices since they look the same reversed as in their normal states.
