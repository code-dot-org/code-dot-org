The next question refers to *hexadecimal* which is a base-16 number system - a number system that uses one of 16 possible digits for each place value.  You may not have explicitly covered hexadecimal in your class yet, that's okay.  Consider this a challenge question and try your best using your intuition about what you already know.


The 16 digits used in hexadecimal are: **0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F**.  These represent the decimal values 0-15, respectively.  Hex is just another number system so, for example the value "fourteen" can be represented in  Decimal, Binary and Hexadecimal like so:

<pre>
    Decimal: 14
     Binary: 1110
Hexadecimal: E
</pre>
