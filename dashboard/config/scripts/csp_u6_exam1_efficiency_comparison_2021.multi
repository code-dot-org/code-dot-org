**Explanation:** Algorithm B is more efficient for smaller inputs, while Algorithm A is more efficient for larger inputs.

[Lesson 2 - Algorithm Efficiency](https://studio.code.org/s/csp6-2021/lessons/2) introduced these types of graphs as a way to compare efficiencies of two or more algorithms.

* AAP-4.A.3: Efficiency is an estimation of the amount of computational resources used by an algorithm. Efficiency is typically expressed as a function of the size of the input. EXCLUSION STATEMENT (EK AAP-4.A.3): Formal analysis of algorithms (Big-O) and formal reasoning using mathematical formulas are outside the scope of this course and the AP Exam.

* AAP-4.A.4: An algorithmâ€™s efficiency is determined through formal or mathematical reasoning.

* AAP-4.A.5: An algorithm's efficiency can be informally measured by determining the number of times a statement or group of statements executes.
