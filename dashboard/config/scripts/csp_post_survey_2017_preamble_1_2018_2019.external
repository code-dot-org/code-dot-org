This post-course survey should be administered **after** the AP exam (if you did it) but before the end of the school year.

**You will be able to see the anonymized results of the survey for your students.**

Why is this survey here?

* A major goal of CS Principles is to broaden participation in computer science.
* It is crucial therefore to have insight into students' attitudes and beliefs about computer science before, during and after the course so we can measure the change over time.
* Completing it also helps us understand important improvements we can make to the curriculum to improve the teacher and student experience.


* Please help by having your students contribute to this vital dataset. Their voices make the difference!
