Consider the following code segment.

```
public static int findMaxValue(int[][] arr) {
    int max = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < arr[0].length; j++) {
            if (arr[i][j] > max) {
                max = arr[i][j];
            }
        }
    }
    return max;
}
```

Which of the following options identifies the error in the given code segment?

teacher_markdown <<MARKDOWN
By initializing `max` to `Integer.MIN_VALUE`, the code ensures that any value encountered in the array will be greater than the initial value of `max`. This allows the code to correctly track and update the maximum value found.

If `max` were initialized to `0`, it would incorrectly assume that the maximum value in the array could be `0`. This would result in incorrect output if the array contains negative numbers or if the maximum value in the array is smaller than `0`.
