# Practice

#### Through prompting there are limitless ways to interact with AI, in this module you will get to explore the possibilities of using a mentor prompt or a tutor prompt.

#### For those of you without restricted access to LLMs and AI, youâ€™ll explore either a Mentor or a Tutor Prompt that you can provide to students to help support them through difficult assignments. These prompts are very similar, but subtly different, and you can preview them <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E74yMRBBy6UDTueKm2rNHHNkKSTh0LjjADArun7Lz9w/edit" target="_blank">here</a>.

#### Our presenters in these videos are the Mollicks, college professors from the Wharton School of Business and early adopters to AI to transform learning. Theyâ€™ve developed these prompts for educators to use and learn from. Prompting to this level is something you could work up to, and can be an incredibly powerful way to use AI; however, this is beyond the scope of this course ðŸ™‚

#### For those of you who are elementary school teachers or otherwise have restricted access to LLMs in the classroom, youâ€™ll learn about some alternative options.


## Educatorâ€™s Choice

<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; padding-bottom:20px;">
    <p>

#### One option is to demonstrate or model AI usage for students as a whole-class activity. While this doesnâ€™t give students individual feedback, it does help them learn about AI usage and gives you a chance to demonstrate how to use AI effectively and safely.

#### Choose one of the above prompts and watch the related video to learn how to use it.
