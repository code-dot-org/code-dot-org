Hosting a good professional development can be challenging in the best of circumstances.  Adding a layer of complexity through sensitive discussions can heighten anxieties related to holding a successful workshop.  

In order to avoid additional stress, Code.org is providing a template for our suggested "Equity Segment".  This workshop includes the following important pieces:

1. An activity to wake everyone up
2. An introduction video that explains why we talk about equity in computer science
3. An opening statement that sets expectations
4. A guided discussion that helps bring biases to light and provides resources to change them.
