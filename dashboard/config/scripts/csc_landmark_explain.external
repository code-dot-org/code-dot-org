# US Historical Landmarks:

##The Statue of Liberty
"The Statue of Liberty Enlightening the World" was a gift of friendship from the people of France to the United States and is recognized as a universal symbol of freedom and democracy. The Statue of Liberty was dedicated on October 28, 1886.  It was designated as a National Monument in 1924.  Employees of the National Park Service have been caring for the colossal copper statue since 1933. [Statue of Liberty](https://www.nps.gov/stli/index.htm)

In the early decades of the twentieth century, civil engineering made dramatic advances in the design and construction of long-span bridges. A great bridge across the Gate, an impossible vision before then, became a challenging possibility. Despite political opposition, scarce funds during the Great Depression that began in 1929, and the immense physical challenges of bridging a mile of water, the people of six counties in northern California voted to finance the Golden Gate Bridge. Engineers and construction workers with imagination, courage, and determination came together to design and build what had been considered until then “the bridge that couldn’t be built.” [Golden Gate Bridge](https://www.goldengate.org/exhibits/the-history-of-the-design-and-construction-of-the-bridge)
