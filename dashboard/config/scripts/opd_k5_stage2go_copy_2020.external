## Pause and reflect
We hope that, up until now, this course has given you a sense of what computer science is, why it is important, and how Computer Science Fundamentals is structured to teach elementary school students basic concepts of computer science. Take a moment to pause and reflect on what you feel like you have learned from this course so far, and go back to any parts you may have had questions on.

Remember that you can always reference the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hstUHTGIdvtPP0TDdEfQeXG3zQ0q6ys237n2BY9CQmg/preview" target="blank">Computer Science Fundamentals curriculum guide</a> for more information.

## Things to remember
As you go forward in this course, keep in mind: 
- As with any discipline, the path towards mastery in computer science is infinite. From novices to veterans, **everyone has something to learn.** 
- Programming becomes more comfortable every time you come back to it. **You're not going to be an expert your first time.**
- There's no way around it, the act of programming and **learning to program takes time, but anyone can do it!**

<br/>

> **Key Takeway:** The goal of the next several lessons is not to turn you into a computer scientist, but to instead help you feel comfortable enough with the core concepts that you are excited to share your knowledge with your students.
