#### Key Concepts

1. Students will be able to explain linear search and use it for a specific problem. 

1. Students will be able to explain binary search and use it for a specific problem.

1. Students will be able to explain when to use binary and linear search.

#### Common Difficulties

One common issues sited by teachers is that the Tower Building Problem could be more relevant to students.  One cool change to the problem we've seen before is using a current events news story like the Rescuing the Chilean Minors.   In addition it is sometimes difficult to get students to see the most efficient solution as they haven't seen a problem like this before.  Help guide students to the binary approach to this problem as much as possible.
