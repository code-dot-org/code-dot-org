# Unit 2: Practice PT highlights

## Practice PT: Encode an Experience

<div style="float:left; padding: 10px; width:55%; background-color: #d9f3f5">
Students invent a binary encoding (file format) for a real life experience.  Students must figure out a way to encode or represent with data, the elements of some kind of human experience. How might you encode a birthday party? or a soccer game? or the brush strokes of a real painting?  Students come up with their own creation and present their work in a format similar to that of a Performance Task. While the project is done individually the lesson helps students through an iterative feedback process with a partner. This assignment emphasizes the writing process, and giving and incorporating feedback from peers.<br><br><br> </div>

This small project culminates a series of lessons in which students, provided a set of raw data, must use digital tools to collaboratively investigate the data to discover possible connections and trends. In the end students must produce a visual explanation of their findings in the data and write a short piece about what the data shows. The emphasis is on producing a visual communication, which mirrors the Computational Artifact piece of the Explore PT. The reflection questions mimic those on the Explore PT.<br><br><br><br></div>
