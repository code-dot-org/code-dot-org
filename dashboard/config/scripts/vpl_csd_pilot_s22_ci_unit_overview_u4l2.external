# Unit Overview

##### The Design Process unit transitions students from thinking about computer science as a tool to solve their own problems towards considering the broader social impacts of computing. Through a series of design challenges, students are asked to consider and understand the needs of others while developing a solution to a problem. The second half of the unit consists of an iterative team project, during which students have the opportunity to identify a need that they care about, prototype solutions both on paper and in App Lab, and test their solutions with real users to get feedback and drive further iteration. 

## Students will:

* ##### See the design process as a form of problem solving that prioritizes the needs of a user. 
* ##### Identify user needs and assess how well different designs address them. 
* ##### Develop paper and digital prototypes, gather and respond to feedback about a prototype, and consider ways different user interfaces do or do not affect the usability of their apps. 
* ##### Understand other roles in software development, such as product management, marketing, design, and testing, and how to use what they have learned about computer science as a tool for social impact.
