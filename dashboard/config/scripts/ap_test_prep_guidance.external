# AP Test Prep Guidance

As we get closer to the AP exam in May, your strategies for supporting your students will need to grow to incorporate deliberate assessment preparation strategies. Your strategies might include things like: 

- practicing with AP-style questions so students gain confidence with they style of question that will be on the exam
- helping students understand how their work is scored
- helping students form study groups

**We're working on a living document (which means it will continue to be updated and grow as we get closer to the exam date) that pulls together tips and tricks from the field, along with resources to help you implement these strategies with your own students.**
