# Paper prototypes

##### Throughout the Design Process unit, students will use paper prototypes as a quick tool to kick off the development of an app. Paper prototypes are an integral part of the entire unit and are first introduced in Lesson 5: User Interfaces as students learn how a simple paper prototype can be used to quickly test ideas an assumptions about an app before starting to build the app on the computer. 

## Key vocabulary

* ##### **Prototype** - A first or early model of a product that allows you to test assumptions before developing a final version.
* ##### **User Interface** - The visual elements of a program through which a user controls or communicates with the application. Often abbreviated UI.

## Prototype testing activity

##### In Lesson 5, students will work with a partner to test out a paper prototype for the "Txt Ur Grndkdz" app. One student will play the role of the User, interacting with the User Interface screens as if itâ€™s an actual app. The other student (the Computer) will take care of making sure the prototype responds as it was designed. 

##### **Students will:**
* ##### Collect and analyze feedback from user testing with a paper prototype.
* ##### Use a paper prototype to test the design of an app.

## Let's explore the activity!
