# CS Principles Chapter Assessment

Read the information below carefully so that you have everything you need before you start and know how to navigate the assessment.

## Things you need

* **Scratch paper and pencil**
 * There are a few questions for which you might want to do some scratch work on paper.

## How to take the test

* Read each question and select the best answer from the choices provided
* Every selection you make is automatically saved, but you can change it if you want.
* Use the orange buttons "Next Page" and "Previous Page" to go forward and backward in the test. Your responses will be saved whether you go forward or backward.

* You can also navigate using the bubbles at the top of the screen.
    * Yellow - means you've visited a page but haven't answered all the questions yet.
    * Green - means you've answered all the questions on a page.

* When you're ready to submit your test go to the LAST page and you'll see a purple "Submit" button. Once you click "submit" the test is sent to your teacher.

* Note that it is also possible to "unsubmit" your test.  You should **only do this in rare cases** - when you submit the test your teacher sees the time it was submitted.
* **Make sure** you are clear with your teacher that it's okay to unsubmit and re-submit - you don't want your entire test invalidated because you submitted after you were supposed to be done.

## Good Luck!

### CAUTION: What this assessment is and isn't

* This assessment is **designed to be in the "style" of the AP** multiple choice assessments.

* That means the questions **are not** specifically about lessons covered prior to this point.  Rather, the questions relate to the underlying AP learning objectives that have theoretically been addressed.

* It **does mean** students might need to do some extrapolation from what they've learned to answer the questions.

* It **does mean** the questions might be "hard", especially for the first-time exposure.

So overall, **USE WITH CAUTION**

* Use your judgment about what stakes to attach to this assessment.
	* You don't have to use this assessment to grade students, or...
    * You can grade students in a different way than simply taking the % correct.

* Ensure that you use in a way that will maintain the spirit of the class in terms of investigation of knowledge.
	* If you are nervous that students will get discouraged, then perhaps re-frame this assessment as an opprotunity to investigate -- let students try the questions, then go research the answers, and change what they got wrong, or develop their own set of questions.

#### F.A.Q. -- How to prepare, administer, and review assessments

Please see our running **[F.A.Q. document here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zEpD1PFt6ec2S8ourxuMH0HD6tiyRvqAGUKGDCOt-qs/edit#heading=h.kewgp6z8qdde)** which contains:

* screenshots on how to prepare, administer, and review assessments
* addresses common issues/problems


#### Quick summary of how to see / review student answers

1. Go to your [Teacher Dashboard](https://code.org/teacher-dashboard#/)
2. Select your CS Principles section
3. You'll see a number of purple tabs including Text Responses, Assessments, etc.
4. Click **Assessments/Surveys**
5. From the course selector dropdown, **select the unit that this assessment appeared in (e.g. Unit 1: The Internet)**
6. For all students who have *submitted* their assessment, you will see two tables:
  * The first table is a summary view summarizing the percentage correct from all the students who submitted, including the timestamp they submitted on
  * The second table is a comprehensive list of each answer to each question submitted by each student

    Above both of these tables is a **Download (or export) as csv** button - allowing you to process answers in a spreadsheet (recommended).

7. If you need to allow a student to UNSUBMIT their test, direct the student to navigate to the last page of the test and press "Unsubmit."

**NOTE about UNSUBMITTING:** 

You should make clear rules with your students about unsubmitting a test. Students might think this is a good way to change an answer after the test is over (i.e. cheat) but you'll see a timestamp of when the student submitted the test.  

It's suggested that you simply establish that you will not consider scoring or grading any tests after a particular time.  If it was not submitted before the specified deadline, it's like you didn't receive it.
