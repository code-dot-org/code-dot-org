# Walking with Wiggle

In the real world, animals rarely walk in a straight line.  Animals meander. They wander, and they graze... especially when they're not being chased by predators!

## Adding a Wiggle

If you want to add a bit more realism, you can add a bit of wiggle to any agent's walk.

To achieve this effect, simply add some random angles in both directions to each step taken.

Experiment a bit with the random number parameter.  What happens when the wiggle is less than 30 degrees?  What if it's greater than 90 degrees?
