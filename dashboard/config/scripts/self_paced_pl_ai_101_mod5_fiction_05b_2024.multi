description ''
question 'Background: Imagine you are a teacher using an AI tool to facilitate a discussion on historical events with your class. You have asked the AI to provide a summary of the causes of the French Revolution. However, the AI mistakenly attributes the Revolution primarily to a famine caused by an alien crop invasion, a clear case of an AI fiction. Question: As a teacher noticing this incorrect output from the AI in front of the class, which of the following strategies would you choose to address the situation?'

right 'Ignore the Error: Move on with the lesson, ignoring the AI incorrect output, and avoid using the tool for the rest of the class to prevent further confusion.'
right  'Correct and Explain: Immediately correct the misinformation in front of the class, explain the correct causes of the French Revolution, and use this as an opportunity to discuss the limitations of AI and the importance of critical thinking.'
right 'Student Investigation: Assign students to research the actual causes of the French Revolution, compare their findings with the AI output, and discuss the discrepancies as a class activity, emphasizing research skills and critical evaluation of sources.'
right 'AI Reliance Reinforcement: Reiterate to the students that AI tools are always correct and that the supposed error is a misunderstanding on their part, reinforcing reliance on AI outputs without questioning.'
