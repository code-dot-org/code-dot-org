#### **This course requires each student to have access to their own internet-connected computer for each CS Discoveries lesson, whether in a classroom or computer lab setting.** Each computer must have a modern web browser installed. All of the course tools and resources (lesson plans, teacher dashboard, videos, student tools, programming environment, etc.) are online and accessible through a web browser. For more information about tech setup go to: <a href="https://code.org/educate/it" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">code.org/educate/it</a>

#### **It is NOT required that students have access to internet-connected computers at home.**

## Suggested Materials / Supplies

### **General Course Materials:**

* #### **Printed handouts:** Many lessons have handouts that are designed to guide students through activities. While it is not required that all of these handouts be printed, many were designed to be printed and we highly recommend printing when possible.
