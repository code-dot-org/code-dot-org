# Unit 2: Lesson 11 - HTTP and Abstraction on the Internet

## Background

Internet protocols define how computers "talk" to one another on the Internet. Most of the conversations are conducted in ASCII-text which can easily be read by humans. Thanks to the power of abstraction, we can rely on TCP/IP and the multiple layers of the physical Internet to handle the details of actually sending these messages. HTTP is one such protocol, and defines how your browser asks a remote server for the text, images, audio, and formatting information used to render a complete webpage.

## Vocabulary

* **HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)** is the protocol used by the World Wide Web. It describes how messages are formatted and interchanged, and how web servers respond to commands.
* **Abstraction:** Reducing information and detail to focus on essential characteristics
* **Server:** A computer that awaits and responds to requests for data
* **Client:** A computer that requests data stored on a server

## Lesson

* Learn about abstraction and layers of the Internet in a video: "The Internet: HTML and HTTP”
* Investigate HTTP traffic across browser
