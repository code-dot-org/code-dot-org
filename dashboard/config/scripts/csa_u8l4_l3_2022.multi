Consider the following method, which implements a recursive binary search that returns an index in `arr` where the value `x` appears if `x` appears in `arr` between `arr[left]` and `arr[right]`, inclusive; otherwise returns `-1`.

```
public static int bSearch(int[] arr, int left, int right, int x) {
   if (right >= left) { 
      int mid = (left + right) / 2;
      
      if (arr[mid] == x) {
         return mid;
      }
      else if (arr[mid] > x) {
         return bSearch(arr, left, mid - 1, x);
      }
      else {
         return bSearch(arr, mid + 1, right, x);
      }
   }
   return -1;
}
```

The following code segment appears in a method in the same class as `bSearch`.

```
int[] nums = {2, 3, 3, 6, 7, 9};
int result = bSearch(nums, 0, nums.length - 1, 3);
```

What is the value of `result` after the code segment has been executed?
