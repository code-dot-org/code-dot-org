# Getting Started > Welcome!

Congratulations on completing your Computer Science in Algebra professional development experience this summer. We hope your back-to-school transition has been an easy one, and that you’re eager to get started applying your learning of CS in your algebra classes.

This online professional development is designed for your use throughout the 2015-16 school year. By working through the stages and levels that follow, you will:

- Build on your understanding of the Code.org CS in Algebra curriculum you first encountered during the summer face-to-face professional development
- Continue to develop your confidence in using the CS in Algebra tools, including Code Studio and the design recipe, in your classroom
- Reflect on your experience and plan for an end-of-year share-out activity
