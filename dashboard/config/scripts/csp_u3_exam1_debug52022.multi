**Explanation:** Walking through the code run based on the description in the question:
* Lines 4 and 8 will run as soon as the program is run, in that order, displaying `banana` then `dragon fruit` to the console.
* The user clicks the “bottomButton” the first time which causes line 6 to run, displaying `cherry` to the console.
* The user clicks the “bottomButton” the second time which causes line 6 to run again, displaying `cherry` to the console again.
