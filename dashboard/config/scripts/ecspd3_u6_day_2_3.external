# Unit 6 Lessons > Days 2-3 

## Concepts Covered

Robot design evaluations and creating algorithms to control robot behavior.

## Lesson Overview

This lesson continues what the students were working on in day one.  They will do some inquiry on what happens if you change the design of a robot and what limitations robots have because of their bodies.  They then get to give verbal commands to one of their peers to move from a starting point in the class room to another point in the room. 

It is a chance for students to use their skills in writing an algorithm from Unit 1 (peanut butter and jelly activity), and Unit 4 using loops to repeat a command, to perform a specific task.  It is a fun time to bring in connections to choreographed dances like the “Macarena," "whip/nae nae," or other popular dances to connect students to where they see such things in the world around them.

> ## Hints from an ECS Teacher: 
> As you make connections back to previous units and writing algorithms, have fun with the students so they feel like exploring and self-discovery with new concepts is safe and encouraged.  This is where we can apply the computer science skills of: creativity, persistence, problem solving and critical thinking that we want all of our students to have.
