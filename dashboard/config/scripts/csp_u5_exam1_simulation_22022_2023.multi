markdown <<MARKDOWN
A restaurant knows from historical data that 60 out of 100 of its customers purchase a full meal while 40 out of 100 only order a side dish. The program below is intended to simulate the orders of 1000 customers.

```
fullMeal ← 0
sideDish ← 0
REPEAT 1000 TIMES
{
	IF (<MISSING CODE>)
	{
		fullMeal ← fullMeal + 1
	}
	ELSE
	{
		sideDish ← sideDish + 1
	}
}
DISPLAY (fullMeal)
DISPLAY ("full meals were ordered,")
DISPLAY (sideDish)
DISPLAY ("side dishes were ordered.")
```

Which of the following can be used to replace `<MISSING CODE>` so that the simulation works as intended?

**Explanation:** Since the value stored in `fullMeal` will be increased by 1 when this statement evaluates to true, it should evaluate to true 60 out of 100 times. Since a number chosen at random between 1 and 100 will be less than or equal to 60, 60 out of every 100 times, this expression can be used to make the simulation work as intended.
