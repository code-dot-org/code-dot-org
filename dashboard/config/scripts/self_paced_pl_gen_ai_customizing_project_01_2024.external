# Lesson 21: Project: Create a Personal Chatbot

#### In this project, students create a chatbot that represents their personality and is an expert on a specific interest they care about. Using their newfound knowledge from this unit, students apply techniques to adjust the temperature, system prompt, and retrieval settings of a chatbot. After testing their chatbot, they create a model card and “publish” it so other users can interact with it.
