wrong 'The artist will draw a triangle with 50 pixel sides.', feedback: 'Incorrect. The variable `length` is being used in the wrong spot!'
wrong 'The artist will draw a 50-sided polygon with 3 pixel sides.', feedback: 'Incorrect. The variable `length` would need to be in the `repeat` loop for that to happen.'
right 'The artist will draw three sides with 50 degree turns.', feedback: 'Correct!  The `length` variable is being used in the `turn` block.'
