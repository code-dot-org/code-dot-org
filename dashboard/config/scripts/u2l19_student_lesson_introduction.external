## Unit 2: Lesson 19 - Public Key Encryption

# Background

Arithmetic can be used to encrypt a message which only an intended recipient can decrypt and read. Using a public lock together with a unique private key, messages can be encrypted and transmitted securely even if the message itself and the method used to encrypt it are both public.

# Vocabulary

asymmetric encryption: a type of cryptographic based on algorithms that require two keys – one of which is secret (or private) and one of which is public (freely known to others).

public key: a value that can be used to encrypt a message. However, only when combined with a mathematically-related private key, can the message be decrypted. 

private key: the complementary key to a public key that is used to decrypt a message.
