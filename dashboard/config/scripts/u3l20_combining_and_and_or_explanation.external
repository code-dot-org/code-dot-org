# Combining AND and OR

You can express more complex conditions by combining **AND** and **OR** in one statement.  You should use parentheses to group expressions together to make it clear which expressions are being "and-ed" or "or-ed" together. 

For example: this statement will evaluate to true if the day is Tuesday or Thursday AND their age is 15 or 16.

# Misconception Alert - using incomplete expressions with boolean operators

Many beginning programmers make a mistake (which reasonable but wrong) while trying to write the expression above. Notice the subtle difference between the correct code above and this version...

![](https://images.code.org/299555658c714c2426f8cf05490f9a6b-image-1448061740731.06.03.png)

An expression like: `(day == "Tuesday" || "Thursday")` is incorrect because unfortunately the computer cannot assume or infer that you are trying to compare "Thursday" to the value that is in the variable `day`.  

Because the string "Thursday" by itself isn't an expression that evaluates to **true** or **false** it *should not* be used as an expression in a boolean operator.

Even more unfortunately, <code>(day == "Tuesday" || "Thursday")</code> **doesn't do what you might think**...it turns out it will run without error and it will *always* be true.

In JavaScript a value on its own, when used in an `if` statement, is *always true*.  For example: <code>if("Thursday")</code> is true. <code>if(15)</code>...<code>if(23423)</code> both true.  This means that <code>if(day=="Tuesday" || "Thursday")</code> is also always true.  
<br>
Some single values such as <code>0</code> and the empty string <code>""</code> evaluate to <strong>false</strong> inside an `if` statement.
<br>
There are other examples of bizarre expressions that evaluate to **true** or **false** when used inside an `if` statement but almost none of them are used intentionally.

Just remember to follow the rules of boolean operators...

The boolean operators **OR** and **AND** *require* that there be an expression that evaluates to **true** or **false** on **both sides** of the operator.

Most of the time you're going to use an expression that uses one of the comparison operators `< > == !=` or a function that returns a **true**/**false** value.

Let's now try using an **AND** and an **OR** in one combined expression...
