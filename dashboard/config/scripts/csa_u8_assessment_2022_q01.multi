Suppose the `binarySearch` method is called with an array containing 20 elements sorted in increasing order. What is the maximum number of times that the statement indicated by `/* calculate midpoint */` could execute?

```
public static int binarySearch(int[] a, int target) {
  int left = 0;
  int right = a.length - 1;
  
  while (left <= right) {
    int mid = (left + right) / 2;   /* calculate midpoint */

    if (a[mid] < target) {
      left = mid + 1;
    }
    else if (a[mid] > target) {
      right = mid - 1;
    }
    else {
      return mid;
    }
  }

  return -1;
}
```
