Consider the following code segment.

```
double num1 = 25.0;
double num2 = 2.0;
double result = Math.abs(num1 - num2) + Math.sqrt(num1) + Math.pow(num2, 2);
System.out.println(result);
```

What will be printed when this code segment is executed?

This code segment first computes the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` using `Math.abs(num1 - num2)`, which gives `23.0`.

Then, it adds the square root of `num1` using `Math.sqrt(num1)`, which gives `5.0`.

Finally, it adds `num2` raised to the power of `2` using `Math.pow(num2, 2)`, which gives `4.0`.

The final result is the sum of these three values, which is `23.0` + `5.0` + `4.0` = `32.0`.
