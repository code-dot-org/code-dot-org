### Turning it on and off

We've got a light, yay! There's no way (aside from pulling the plug) to turn in on or off, boo! What we need is an easy way to open and close the circuit. We can add a button or a switch to do that. There are a lot of different kinds of buttons and switches available, but there are two main features that we need to worry about:

#### Open or Closed?

Buttons and switches come in Normally Open (NO) or Normally Closed (NC) configurations. This refers to the state of the button or switch when it is unpressed/unswitched. A Normally Open (NO) button breaks the circuit by default, only closing (and thus activating) the circuit when it is pressed. A Normally Closed (NC) button gives you an closed circuit be default, only opening (and thus deactivating) the circuit when pressed.

#### Momentary or Latching?

The other major identifier of a swtich or button is whether it is momentary or latching. A momentary button is only changes state while you are actively pressing it, like the power button on your computer. A latching button changes state each time you press it, like a lightswitch. For latching switches NC and NO refer to the state of the switch when it is _off_.
