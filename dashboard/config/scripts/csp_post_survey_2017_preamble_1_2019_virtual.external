### **This survey is anonymous** 

*Code.org takes your privacy very seriously.* Your responses here will be kept **anonymous**. No one, not even your teacher, can link your responses back to you as an individual.

We do this because we want you to **be as open and honest as possible**. We care about your experience in the course, and we make improvements based on what you say.

* The survey should take **10 minutes or less** to complete.
