Consider the following class definition.

```
public class ScoreBoard {

   private int score = 0;
   private static int attempts = 0;

   public ScoreBoard(int newScore) {
      score = newScore;
      attempts++;
   }

   public void incrementAttempts() {
      attempts++;
   }

   public void incrementAttempts(int inc) {
      attempts += inc;
   }

   public int getAttempts() {
      return y;
   }
}
```

The following code segment appears in a class other than `ScoreBoard`.

```
ScoreBoard first = new ScoreBoard(10);
ScoreBoard second = new ScoreBoard(20);
ScoreBoard third = new ScoreBoard(30);
first.incrementAttempts();
second.incrementAttempts(10);
System.out.println(third.getAttempts());
```

What is printed as a result of executing the code segment if the code segment is the first use of a `ScoreBoard` object?
