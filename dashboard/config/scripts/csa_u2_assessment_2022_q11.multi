Consider the following class definition.

```
public class Student {
   private double gpa;

   public Student(double newGpa) {
      gpa = newGpa;
   }

   public void setGpa (double newGpa) {
      gpa = newGpa;
   }
}
```

Consider the following code segment, which appears in a method in a class other than `Student`. The code segment does not compile.

```
Student s = new Student(3.0);
System.out.println("The new GPA is " + s.setGpa(3.5));
```

Which of the following best explains the reason why the code segment will not compile?
