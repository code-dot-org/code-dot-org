Looking at the code line by line:

* i is set to 1
* The code inside the loop will run to the end of the list (the length of the list)
* Inside the loop, if the data at index i equals n, the i (index) is displayed
* i is incremented by one until it equals the length

In summary, this code goes through the entire list and if the value equals n at that index, it displays it.
