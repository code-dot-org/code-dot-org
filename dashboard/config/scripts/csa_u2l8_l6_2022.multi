Consider the following class definition.

```
public class ShavedIce {

   private String topping;
   
   // Constructor not shown
}
```

Which of the following is a correct header for a method of the `ShavedIce`(#e7e8ea) class that would change the value of the instance variable `topping`(#e7e8ea) so it can be called from a class other than `ShavedIce`(#e7e8ea)?
