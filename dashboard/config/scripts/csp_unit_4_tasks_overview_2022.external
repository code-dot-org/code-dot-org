* Pay attention to the role of collaboration in Unit 4 and the project.

In the next two levels, you will see two example “Decision Maker Apps” that show some possibilities of what students are able to create by the end of Unit 4.  You will also use these apps in Unit 4, Lesson 12 in your own classroom to help students prepare to create their own Decision Maker Apps.  In the next two levels, follow the directions on the screen to analyze the app.
