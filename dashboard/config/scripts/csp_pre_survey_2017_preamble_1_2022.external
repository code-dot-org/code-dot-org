Best practice is to let students complete this survey **before** engaging in any class activities.  Most teachers do this as part of a day of initial class tech setup.

You will be able to see the anonymized results of the survey for your students.

Why is this survey here?
* A major goal of this course is to broaden participation in computer science.
* We attempt to measure how students' attitudes and beliefs about computer science might change during the course through pre and post-surveys.
* Completing it also helps us understand important improvements we can make to the curriculum to improve the teacher and student experience.


* Please help by having your students contribute to this vital dataset. Their voices make the difference!
