#### While teaching this Unit, it's important to emphasize responsible use when students interact with AI Chat Lab. Here are a few tips:
* #### **Encourage Awareness**: Remind students that all interactions with the chatbot are recorded and monitored, ensuring that their conversations remain respectful and on-topic. Any inappropriate messages will be flagged, and consequences may follow.
* #### **Protect Personal Information**: Teach students the importance of keeping personal information private. They should avoid sharing details like their name, phone number, or address when interacting with the chatbot.
* #### **Promote Responsible Communication**: Reinforce the idea that the chatbot is a tool for learning and growth, not just for casual conversation. Encourage students to use it responsibly and with a focus on education.
* #### **Be Prepared to Have Discussions with Students**: Use unexpected outputs as teaching moments. Encourage critical thinking by discussing potential biases in AI, how AI works, and why the chatbot might generate certain outputs.
* #### **Actively Monitor Student Usage**: You should actively monitor student usage to identify any potential issues, providing guidance and intervention as necessary to maintain a safe and supportive learning environment.

#### In the next level youâ€™ll get to experiment with **temperature**. Temperature is one of the values you can control once a language model has been trained. Experiment with temperature and see if you can tell what it does!
