## Unit 3: Lesson 28 - While Loop Basics

# Background

While loops occur frequently in every-day lives. That makes it easy to conceptualize how they work as a modification of the conditional statement. An iterator variable or a counter is used to keep track of the number of times a loop executes.

# Lesson

* Design a flowchart of an every-day while loop.
* Create while loops in App Lab.
