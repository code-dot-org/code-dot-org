Consider the following code segment that appends numbers to a list one at a time.

    data <- []
    APPEND (data, 2)
    APPEND (data, 6)
    APPEND (data, 9)
    APPEND (data, 3)
    APPEND (data, 1)
    
What is the value of data[2] after the code above is executed (Assume indexing begins with 1)

Going through the code line by line while keeping track of what data looks like after each call:

* data = []
* Note that appending a number puts the number at the end of the current list
* APPEND (data, 2). data = [2]
* APPEND (data, 6). data = [2,6]
* APPEND (data, 9). data = [2,6,9]
* APPEND (data, 3). data = [2,6,9,3]
* APPEND (data, 1). data = [2,6,9,3,1]
* At index 2, data[2] = 6
