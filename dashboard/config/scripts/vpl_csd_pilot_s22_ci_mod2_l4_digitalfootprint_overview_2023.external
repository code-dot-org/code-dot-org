## Lesson 5 Overview

##### In Lesson 5 students look through several example social media profiles for fake students. Individually these pages contain relatively innocuous information, but when students cross reference information across multiple profiles they see how a detailed picture (or Digital Footprint) can start to form. Through this activity students see that even information that they may not see as private on its own can share more information than intended when combined with other small details.
