By completing Stage 5, you will:

- Practice coding simple loops
- Reflect on classroom application

> **What to Expect in this Stage:** In the levels that follow, we'll introduce an unplugged lesson and a series of puzzles from Course C (meant for Grade 2) that focus on the concept of loops. In order to complete a puzzle, you'll need to write code using visual, block-based programming. We'll close with an opportunity to reflect. You should spend between 20-45 minutes on this stage.

Ready? Let's go!
