wrong 'Higher level languages utilize abstraction to hide details of the CPU instructions from the programmer.'
wrong 'A computer chip is often an abstraction of many lower level logic gates and memory combined to perform a specific function.'
right 'Binary sequences are abstractions which are used to represent colors in an image.'
wrong 'Smaller programs and apps can be combined into large programs to create higher level abstractions.'

MARKDOWN
teacher_markdown <<MARKDOWN
Learning Objective: **2.2.3** and Essential Knowledge statements: **2.2.3G**
<hr>
 (A) This option is incorrect. Higher level languages DO hide the details of lower level languages from the programmer.  A CPU instruction set is considered a low-level language.

<hr>
 (B) This option is incorrect. Many computer chips combiner thousands of logic gates and memory to perform functions.

<hr>
 (C) This option is correct. Pixels are abstractions of RGB data which are in turn abstractions of binary sequences which are one of the lowest levels of abstraction.

<hr>
 (D) This option is incorrect. Smaller programs, apps, functions, and procedures are often combined to make larger programs making this statement true.
