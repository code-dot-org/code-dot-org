### What to Expect: Material We'll Cover


**Phase 1 consists of three components:**

  1) an introduction to the course (10 minutes);<br>
  2) eight CS in Science intro videos (roughly 58 minutes total); and<br>
  3) a guided tutorial introduction to StarLogo Nova (approximately 60 minutes).<br>

The set of Phase 1 components can be completed in 3 hours or less.

 
**What we'll cover:**

Within each of the lessons, you will watch a video, occasionally review a document, test your understanding by answering a quiz question or two, write a reflection on a topic and post it to the online forum, read other participants’ entries on the forum and write a comment in reaction, and perhaps read an accompanying article.

The guided tutorial, “Getting Started in StarLogo Nova”, takes you through a series of steps that will introduce you to the modeling and simulation environment. After completing each of the steps, you will save your project and share a link to it on the forum.

Let’s get started!
