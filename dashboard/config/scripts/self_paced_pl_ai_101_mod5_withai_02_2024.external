# Restriction and Access Issues

#### Before we dive in, let’s address some potential restriction and access issues.

#### As of the publishing of this module, ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini all require users be 13 or older with users under 18, requiring parent or guardian's permission to create an account. Additionally, some school districts have banned or restricted the use of LLMs and AI in general with students.

#### Make sure you reference your school and district policies before you use ChatGPT or any other AI technology with your students.

#### We’ll address some of the reasons behind these restrictions in the next module. The good news is that there are alternative ways to still engage with AI in these situations.
