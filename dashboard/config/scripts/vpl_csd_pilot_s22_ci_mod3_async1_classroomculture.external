# Classroom culture

##### In a CS Discoveries classroom, students are expected to solve problems that donâ€™t have clear answers, work together with their peers, and play an active role in their learning. For some students, this might be a new way of learning. The culture that is created within the classroom from the start is crucial in helping students feel like they belong in CS and in setting students up for success throughout the course.

## What does a classroom with a positive culture look like?

* ##### What do you see?
* ##### What do you hear?
* ##### What are the students doing?
* ##### What is the teacher doing?
