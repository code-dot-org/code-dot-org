# Check for Understanding

## Answer: True

#### Large Language Models (LLMs) are indeed a type of AI designed to understand and generate human-like text based on extensive training data. These models, such as OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series, are trained on a large body of text from the internet and are capable of generating coherent and contextually relevant text given a prompt or input. They have been applied in various natural language processing tasks, including language translation, text summarization, question answering, and dialogue generation.
