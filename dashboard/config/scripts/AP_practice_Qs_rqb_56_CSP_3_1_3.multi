As the president of her school\'s student council, Kayla is in charge of organizing a fundraiser for the Fall Thriller program. After the event, she is expected to submit a written report with an analysis of how the money was spent, for audit purposes. Kayla has categorized her spending into 4 categories: Promotional material, Decorations, Food, and Entertainment. She is wondering what data chart would be best suited to analyze the percentage spending of the different  categories.
