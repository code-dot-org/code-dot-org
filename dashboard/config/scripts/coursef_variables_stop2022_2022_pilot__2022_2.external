# Stop!

## Are you sure you're ready to move on? 


In the next level, you will begin writing the code for your project. This works best if you already have a plan.

Your completed plan should include:

* The type of project you're building. For example, a greeting card, chatbot, or blank space story.
* A list of questions you will ask the user.
* The other text you will display to the screen.
* A description or drawing of the sprites you will need (and their behaviors).

If you are not sure if you are ready to move on, check with your teacher!
