# Unit 3: Lesson 06 - Functions and Top-Down Design

## Lesson

* Learn about top-down design.
* Practice top-down design on a small problem.
* Program a solution to that problem.
* Revisit the 3x3 grid problem and consider using functions to solve it more efficiently.
  
## Vocabulary
* **Abstraction** - Pulling out specific differences to make one solution work for multiple problems.
* **Function** - A piece of code that you can easily call over and over again.
* **Top Down Design** - a problem solving approach (also known as stepwise design) in which you break down a system to gain insight into the sub-systems that make it up.

## Resources
