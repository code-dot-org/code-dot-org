Learning Objective: **4.1.1** and Essential Knowledge statements: **4.1.1B**

(A) This answer is correct. The variable `x` is initially -1.  It does not satisfy the `IF` condition, so the `ELSE` statement is executed, increasing its value to 9. The second iteration of the `REPEAT`, the initial `IF` statement is true, and so the variable now has the value 10. The next `IF` is also true, and so the variable now has the value 12.

(B) **This answer is incorrect.** See the explanation for answer A.
