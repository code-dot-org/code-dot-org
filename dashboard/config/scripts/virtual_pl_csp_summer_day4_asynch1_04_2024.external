# Applying Our Knowledge of Identity and Bias

---

#### In the class, you have introduced the idea of “patterns” and places and together you talked about how there are four different patterns if you have just two places. Students are about to work in groups to list all possible three place value patterns, but with an added focus on the order of their patterns.
#### These three students have been given one set of manipulatives and are placed in a group to accomplish this task. As you observe the group you overhear the following conversation.

---

### **Simone** takes out the manipulatives from the bag and starts re-arranging them.

### **James** is writing down something on the paper

### **Miranda** asks "Should we start by adding on to what we did with two patterns?"

### **James** says "The answer is 16."

### **Miranda** says "How did you get that?"

### **James** says "2 times 2 times 2. It is combinatorics - I remember it from stats."
