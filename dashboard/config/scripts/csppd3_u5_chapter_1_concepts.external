### Unit 5 Overview > Chapter 1: Explore Performance Task > Concepts

#### What's Inside?

The skinny: The Explore Performance Task is essentially a research paper.  Students must investigate a modern computing innovation, write about how it works, and describe its impacts (both good and bad) on society.<br><br>

**Unit 5 - Lesson 1** gears students up to actually do the task.  In that lesson students will:

- Review the Explore Performance Task description and rubric
- Understand what **computational artifact** means
- Understand what a **computing innovation** is for this context
- Review **research practices** and strategies (how to cite sources properly)

**Unit 5 - Lesson 2** is the actual administration of the task.  The associated lesson plan contains:

- Timeline for administering the task
- Tips on the role of the role of the instructor
- Instructor Dos and Don'ts during administration of the Task 

#### Content Overview

Students need to be given 8 hours of class time to complete the Explore PT. The AP Explore Performance Task and Rubric make a list of all the steps in the process. This list includes:

* Coming up with a computing innovation to research.
* Finding sources about your computing innovation.
* Written responses.
* Computational Artifact.

For more details about the performance task, refer to the following documents:

* [AP Explore Performance Task Overview](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2UNlnU_5Vg4eWlNN1dKNnRCTG8)
* Official rubric coming soon

##### What is a Computational Innovation?

The College Board requires that students select and investigate a computational artifact that:

* Has or has had the potential to have significant beneficial and harmful effects on society, economy, or culture.
* Consumes, produces, and/or transforms data.
* Raises at least one data storage concern, data privacy concern, or data security concern.

##### What is a Computational Artifact?

The College Board defines a “computational artifact” as “a visualization, a graphic, a program, video, or audio that students create using a computer.”

Students should understand which computational artifacts would be considered effective and ineffective:<br><br>

**Effective artifacts include:**

* Visual, graphical and/or audio content to help a reader understand the purpose of a computing innovation.
* Using communication media such as animations, comic strips, infographics, and/or public service announcements to illustrate the purpose of a computing innovation.

**Ineffective artifacts include:**

* Artifacts that repeat information previously supplied in the written responses.
* Multi-slide presentations with paragraphs of text or bullets.
* Artifacts that have not been created by the student.
* Artifacts that focus on advertising the computing innovation’s functionality instead of the purpose of the innovation.

In Unit 4 we spent time learning how to make data visualizations *because* they work as very effective artifacts that can tell a story without text.  A suggested strategy is to find some data, or even create some data to create a chart or some kind that conveys a “story” in the chart.

##### How Have Students Prepared for This Task?

Previously in this class, students have done a number of practice PTs to prepare them for the actual Explore PT, including: 

* Unit 2, Lesson 12: The Internet and Society
* Unit 2, Lesson 20: Cybersecurity Innovations View Lesson Plan 
* Unit 4, Lesson 09 : Tell a Data Story
* Unit 4, Lesson 11: Data Innovations
* Unit 4, Lesson 14: Propose an Innovation

In these practice PTs, students practiced the following skills:

* Researching a specific innovation
* Writing about the innovation
* Creating visualizations 
* Understanding and explaining how data is used
