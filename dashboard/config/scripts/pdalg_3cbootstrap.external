# Planning For the Future > Bringing more CS to your Algebra Class

## What to do if I want to do more!

We've also gotten a ton of messages from teachers who are chomping at the bit to do even more CS in their Algebra or other math classes. While we're not currently developing any additional courses, the curriculum on which we based CS in Algebra, [Bootstrap](https://bootstrapworld.org) is a great followon course to CS in A.

## What's the difference between CS in Algebra and Bootstrap?

Code.org’s CS in Algebra is an adaption of [Bootstrap’s curriculum](https://www.bootstrapworld.org). The primary goal of our modification was to merge Bootstrap’s content and pedagogy with our block-based language, online learning system, and scaffolding teaching paradigm. Additionally we have divided the original content from Bootstrap into two separate courses to simplify implementation for teachers who are concerned that they don’t have enough time for the full 20 hours. And, starting in 2016-2017, Code.org's in person professional development will focus on Course A. For schools that want to invest more in CS, Bootstrap offers a deeper curriculum that gives classrooms the flexibility of going beyond 20 hours and a longer in person professional development workshop covering 20 hours of material.  Depending on the needs of your school or classroom, each curriculum offers a different mix of pedagogy, content and curricular design:

## Can I use Bootstrap along side CS in Algebra?

You bet! Because we worked with the folks at Bootstrap to develop CS in Algebra, you'll find that much of the pedagogy and practices (such as the circles of evaluation and the Design Recipe) are already familiar to your students.

### Bootstrap I
[Bootstrap I](http://www.bootstrapworld.org/materials/spring2016/courses/bs1/index.shtml) follows the same learning progression as CS in Algebra, but using a text-based language and more open lesson design, making it a great second year option for students who learned the basics in CS in Algebra and want to start digging deeper. 

### Bootstrap II
[Bootstrap II](http://www.bootstrapworld.org/materials/spring2016/courses/bs2/index.shtml) builds on Bootstrap I (and therefore CS in Algebra) to introduce students to more advanced programming concepts, such as data structures, which enable them to create more sophisticated programs and games.
