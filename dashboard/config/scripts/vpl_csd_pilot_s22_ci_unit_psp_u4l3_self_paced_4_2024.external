The Design Process unit uses the Problem Solving Process with Design.

#### Below, you will find more information about the Problem Solving Process with Design. **You do not** need to study these carefully before progressing, nor do your students need to complete each bullet point within Define, Prepare, Try, and Reflect. Just take a moment to review each section, as you'll be introducing the following as a **guiding framework** to your students.

## 🔎 **Define**
* #### Identify individuals or groups of people who could benefit from your product.
* #### Identify the needs and wants of people who could use your product.
* #### Imagine you’re one of your users. Write down what users might see, hear, or feel when experiencing their needs or wants.
* #### If possible, interview potential users to learn more about what they want.
* #### Consider creating sentences like, “______ needs a way to ______ in order to ______. It should ______.”
<br>

## 📝 **Prepare**
* #### Set aside your own personal beliefs or assumptions so you can **empathize** with the users.
* #### Brainstorm potential solutions that meet the needs and wants of your users.
* #### Research what exists and how others have addressed similar problems and see what you can learn.
* #### Create a “pros” and “cons” list for potential solutions to help decide which one to create.
* #### You won’t be able to create everything all at once - decide on the “minimum” you need to create to start testing and learn what works and what doesn’t.
<br>

## 🖥️ **Try**
* #### Sketch your idea on paper or with a digital tool.
* #### Create a **prototype** of your product, which is a quick, low-stakes version of your idea that you can test.
* #### Identify a specific aspect of your prototype you want to test and receive feedback on.
* #### Share your prototype with others and get feedback, then group that feedback into categories.
<br>

## 🤔 **Reflect**
* #### What categories of feedback did you get from your design? What improvements can you make based on that feedback?
* #### What was the reaction to your prototype when you shared it with others? How can you build on positive reactions? How can you make changes to avoid negative reactions?
* #### What aspect of your prototype are you most proud of? What part needs improvement?
* #### Based on your testing, if you were to restart the Problem Solving Process at the Define step, what new problems would you try to identify? How might you iterate on what you have to make it more useful to your users?
