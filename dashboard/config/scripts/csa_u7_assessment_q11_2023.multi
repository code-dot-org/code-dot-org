Consider the following method.

```
public static int mystery(ArrayList<Integer> numList) {
  if (numList.size() == 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  else {
    int val = numList.remove(0);
    return 1 + mystery(numList);
  }
}
```

Which of the following best describes the value returned by the method?

The `mystery` method is a recursive method that operates on an `ArrayList` of integers.

Here's what it does:

1. If the `ArrayList` is empty (i.e., its size is `0`), it returns `0`. This is the base case for the recursion.

2. If the `ArrayList` is not empty, it removes the first element from the `ArrayList`, then calls itself recursively on the updated `ArrayList`, and adds `1` to the result of this recursive call.

This process continues until the `ArrayList` is empty. Each recursive call removes one element from the `ArrayList`, and adds `1` to the total count.

So, the `mystery` method is essentially counting the number of elements in the `ArrayList`.
