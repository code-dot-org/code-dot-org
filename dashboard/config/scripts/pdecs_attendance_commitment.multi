1. Teachers will only receive stipends for the hours that they attend the professional development.
2. Arriving/leaving over 30 minutes late/early will count as a full day absence if not approved by
Code.org prior to the workshop.
3. Teacher must complete Phase 1 PD prior to the start of Phase 2 PD to continue to be part of
the program and will not receive his/her Phase 2 PD stipend until Phase 1 PD is completed.
4. Teacher must attend the full 5 days of Phase 2 PD to continue to be part of the program.
5. Teacher must be teaching computer science to a minimum of 1 section of students when the
school year begins to continue to receive their stipend.
6. Teacher must attend all 4 days of Saturday in-person workshops (these
happen during the academic year) and all 3 days of Phase 4 PD.

__If you have a schedule conflict e-mail [pd@code.org](mailto:pd@code.org) and notify your
district contact as soon as possible.__

Exceptions to this policy include districts where Saturday workshop participation is voluntary per union regulations.
