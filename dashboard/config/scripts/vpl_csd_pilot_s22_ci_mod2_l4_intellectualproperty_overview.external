# Intellectual Property

##### At the start of the unit, the only content that students use on their web pages is their own. However, later in the unit they will be adding images to their sites. Before they do so, they need to understand the rules governing how to legally use content they find on the web. We use the Creative Commons license as a clearer alternative to the more restrictive standard copyright and guide students through searching for, using, and properly citing Creative Commons licensed media.

## Lesson 8 overview

##### Starting with a discussion of their personal opinions on how others should be allowed to use their work, the class explores the purpose and role of copyright for both creators and users of creative content. They then move on to an activity exploring the various Creative Commons licenses as a solution to the difficulty in dealing with copyright.
