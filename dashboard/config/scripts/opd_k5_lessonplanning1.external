**Logistics**

* What classroom routines or procedures are needed for the lesson?

* Does the lesson use debugging or pair programming?
	* If so, how will you support your students with debugging or pair programming?

**Inclusion**
* When will you teach the lesson to **all** of your students?
* How will you know **all** of your students are engaged during the lesson?

## Teach the lesson!

Find a time to teach the lesson to all of your students.  After teaching the lesson, reflect on:
