### Challenge Overview > Understanding the Challenge 

<br/>

#### 1. Challenge Prep: 

##### Pick a Performance Task

The challenge for Unit 5 is to try your hand at (starting) one of the Performance Tasks.  You probably won't finish in the two hours of PD time, but you should start one in earnest in order to anticipate the student experience and prepare for it.

- First, you'll need to **select a Performance Task.** The challenge lessons are listed on the next level.
- Next, you will head to the forum and **share which lesson you plan to complete** for your challenge. <a href="http://forum.code.org/t/unit-4-challenge-selection/3301" target=_blank>forums >> </a>

##### Get into the Performance Task and associated lesson 

- **Read through** the entire lesson plan.
- **Understand the Performance Task** and be prepared to start it 

<hr>
#### 2. Do the Performance Task: 
##### While you're working... 

- **Save the artifact(s)** you create along the way. 
 - For the **Explore** Task your artifacts might be research, a visual or infographic you made, or some written thoughts
 - For the **Create** Task your artifacts might be a program (obviously) or you might try your hand at making a video of a program you wrote, or a PDF with certain sections highlighted, etc.
 
- **Jot down your thoughts** about: 
    - ahha! moments during the activities
    - what was difficult about these activities? (for you and/or your students)
    - what did you enjoy about this lesson?
    - what additional resources might be useful for teaching this lesson? 

** --------------- REMOVE? -----------------**
##### Extend the Lesson

- **Create your own** Extension Activity or Assessment Question that could be used with this lesson.
 - Remember, an **Extension Activity** is an exercise or project that could be added to the lesson plan and completed by students to build on what they learned. An **Assessment Question** could be a formative or summative assessment item that is used to check student understanding of the concept(s) covered in the lesson. 
- Develop a **write-up** explaining to another teacher how to use your Extension or Assessment item. 

** -------------- ^^^^ REMOVE? ^^^^ ----------------- **

    - Advice for someone who is going to teach this lesson (consider what was challenging about doing the activity, what you think students will struggle with, etc).
