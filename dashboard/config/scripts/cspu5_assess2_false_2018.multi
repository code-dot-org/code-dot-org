Strings can be any combinations and any types of characters if it is surrounded by quotation marks "". This includes having numerical digits as a string; however, it is important to note that the number will be treated as a string and not as an integer.

For example:

* var num1 = "5";
* var num2 = "3";
* If you add num1 and num2 together, you are combining the strings and not the values of the strings.
* num1 + num2 = "53" and NOT 8 because the variables are of a string type.
