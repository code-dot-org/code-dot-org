## Unit 1: Lesson 14 - Encoding B&W Images
# Background

Digital images perform the difficult task of translating human vision into a bit-level encoding. Accomplishing this task requires both technical know-how and an understanding of how human vision works. Digital images break a larger image into small squares on a monitor, called pixels, which can be individually illuminated. In a black and white image each pixel may either be turned on or off, and so can be represented by a single bit.
# Vocabulary
* Pixel: the fundamental unit of a digital image, typically a tiny square which contains a single color. Pixel is short for "picture element"
* Metadata: data that provides more information or context about another piece of data

# Lesson 

* Develop encoding scheme for B&W images
* Experiment with Pixelation Tool
* Incorporate metadata into encoding of a digital image
