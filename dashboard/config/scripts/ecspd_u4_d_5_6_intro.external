First, let's explore the fourth lesson in the unit. To begin, find your ECS Version 5 curriculum and open to page 143-145.

## Key Concepts

- Students will answer questions based on the Moving Project and then complete the Baseball  Project.  They will be introduced to the concept of a sprite moving around the screen and will need to understand the x-y coordinate plane, the three different move blocks "move\_steps" block, "go to x:\_ y:\_" block and "glide\_ sec to x:\_ y:\_" block.
- Students will also need to understand the repeat block will do whatever number is inside the block n times, which is also called looping or iteration.
- Students will also see that sprites will reinitialize themselves when the green flag is clicked so they start back where they were before the game started.
- Students will be introduces to the "point in direction" block, Looks Tab to see "next costume' block and the "switch costume" block.

## Common Difficulties

This lesson was one that was presented at the in person workshop. Although it may seem obvious that the three move blocks work differently and you'd use them at different times, students might not get that concept very fast, so it might be helpful to have them act out the different actions of the blocks or show examples from popular apps of how sprites move differently.

If you decide to have them act out the blocks,  you will first need to establish the plane for them to move on and where they are to start. Next you might assign with a specific block and provide information for how that block would move. Have groups of students try all three types of blocks and note the differences.

For this lesson you need â€“ [moving.sb](http://www.exploringcs.org/curriculum) and [baseball.sb files](http://www.exploringcs.org/curriculum).

If using Scratch is new for you, you may want to open the moving.sb file and play around with the blocks before teaching it so you feel comfortable with them.
