# Unit 4 Tool Talk

Unit 4 is a plugged in unit, where students will primarily engage in research to first learn about the type of information that's made available online, and then they use educational discovery tools to explore how that data and information is secured. All lessons will require students to use their computers and they will benefit from logging on to Code Studio to access tools and resources.

## Videos in Unit 4
There are several videos used throughout Unit 4 to introduce and give examples of key concepts related to data, security, and encryption. Specifically, you will find videos in the following lessons:

- **Lesson 1: What is Big Data?** | Ted Talk
- **Lesson 2: Rapid Research - Data Innovations** | Concept Videos and Ted Talk
- **Lesson 4: The Cost of Free** | Concept Video
- **Lesson 7: Public Key Cryptography** | Concept Video

## External Tools and Resources in Unit 4
Several lessons in this unit leverage external tools and resources to give students an introduction to Big Data, and how it can be used to identify people.

- **Lesson 1: What is Big Data?** | Students choose from a selection external websites to experiment with various data aggregators
- **Lesson 2: Rapid Research - Data Innovations** | Research tools (search engines, etc) for investigating a data innovation; Text editing tool (e.g., Google Docs, MS Word, etc)
- **Lesson 3: Identifying People With Data** | [Visualization tool that shows data breaches](http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/); Research tools (search engines, etc) so students can see how much information they can find out about themselves
- **Lesson 4: The Cost of Free** | Website of students' choice to read the privacy policy
- **Lesson 6: Encryption with Keys and Passwords** | [Password Strength Checker](http://howsecureismypassword.net)
- **Lesson 7: Public Key Cryptography** | [Interactive Clock](http://www.visnos.com/demos/clock)

## Code Studio Tools in Unit 4
Lessons 5 - 7 take students through a series of discovery lessons related to how digital information on the internet is protected and secured. These lessons rely heavily on educational widgets that are built into Code Studio.

- **Lesson 5: Simple Encryption** | [Caesar Cipher Widget](https://studio.code.org/s/csp4-2019/stage/5/puzzle/2) to crack a simple alphabetic shift cipher; [Frequency Analysis Widget](https://studio.code.org/s/csp4-2019/stage/5/puzzle/5) to crack a random substitution cipher
- **Lesson 6: Encryption with Keys and Passwords** | [Vigenere Cipher Widget](http://studio.code.org/s/csp4-2019/stage/6/puzzle/2)
- **Lesson 7: Public Key Cryptography** | [Modulo Clock](https://studio.code.org/s/csp4-2019/stage/7/puzzle/4) to explore "clock" arithmetic; [Public Key Crypto Widget](https://studio.code.org/s/csp4-2019/stage/7/puzzle/6) to explore how public key cryptography works
