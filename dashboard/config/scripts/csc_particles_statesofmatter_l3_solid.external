# States Of Matter
Look around you. Everything you can see is matter. This is the special name that scientists use to describe the stuff that everything is made of. Matter behaves and looks differently depending on many different factors.

All matter is made up of tiny, individual particles called atoms. These tiny atoms move and change their behavior which make matter appear in either **solid**, **liquid**, or **gas** form.

## Solid Matter
Most things that we use on a daily basis are solids! This means that the particles are arranged in a fixed pattern and the atoms donâ€™t move very much.

Solid matter can be strong or weak. For example, steel is known for being very strong. Other solids like ice, wood or paper are weaker. However, in all cases, the particles are tightly bound together!
