teacher_markdown <<MARKDOWN
**Explanation:** This is an example of sequential programming where the program statements run in order, from top to bottom. Since the last change to the “background-color” of the “topButton” is to the color blue, that is the color it will be when the program is done running.

[Lesson 6 - Intro to Programming](https://studio.code.org/s/csp3-2021/lessons/6) showed students examples of programs like this one.

::: details [**Essential Knowledge Connected To This Question**]

CRD-2.C.5: In event-driven programming, program statements are executed when triggered rather than through the sequential flow of control.
