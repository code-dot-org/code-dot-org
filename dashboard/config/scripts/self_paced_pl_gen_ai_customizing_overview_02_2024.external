# Customizing Large Language Models Overview


#### This unit is designed to deepen students' understanding of how text-based generative AI models function and how they can be customized for specific tasks. The lessons focus on two primary aspects: system prompting and retrieval. Students will explore how prompts and retrieval methods influence the behavior of AI models, allowing them to generate more accurate and relevant responses. 

#### Through hands-on activities, students will learn to design prompts that guide the AIâ€™s output effectively and use retrieval to provide the AI with relevant information. The unit also introduces model cards as tools for planning and documenting AI behavior, culminating in a project where students create a personal chatbot that reflects their unique personality and preferences. 

#### By the end of this unit, students will have the skills to customize AI models thoughtfully, considering the ethical implications and potential biases in AI systems.
