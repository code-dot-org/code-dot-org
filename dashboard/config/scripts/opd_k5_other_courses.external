### PLANNING > Other Courses

Code.org offers a number of other curriculum resources for courses that are not yet integrated with Code Studio. These courses are generally longer, more in-depth and require more expertise on the part of the educator than our Code Studio courses. As we continue to build our organization, our goal is to provide better access to these tools. In the meantime, feel free to explore these courses if they interest you, and use any resources you like (all are licensed under Creative Commons for classroom use).

#### About our Middle and High School Courses

Code.org also offers semester- and year-long middle and high school curriculum, although this curriculum is not linked to Code Studio at this time. You can access the curriculum through the links below:

**Middle school (Grades 6-8)**

- [CS in Algebra](http://code.org/curriculum/algebra/): Learn how computer programmers use algebra and geometry to develop video games
- [CS in Science](http://code.org/curriculum/science/): Explore and develop complex scientific models through agent-based programming

**High school (Grades 9-12)**

- [Exploring Computer Science](http://www.exploringcs.org/): A high school course designed to broaden participation in computer science
- [Computer Science Principles (future AP)](http://code.org/educate/csp): A course teaching a wide range of computer science topics, including programming in JavaScript

More in-depth professional development on these curricula are available through our district partnerships program. If you're interested in becoming a district partner, please [visit this page for more information](http://code.org/educate/districts).
