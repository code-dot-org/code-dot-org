# Assessment Levels
##To ensure our PL is engaging and informative, include opportunities for learners to check their understanding.


### **Guidelines**
* #### Use at least one assessment per lesson 
* #### Include at least one assessment level per concept that is introduced 
* #### Vary the type of assessments you use
* #### Limit the usage of open response levels. Learners cannot get feedback in these PL courses, so open response levels should be limited to reflection questions. 

### **Exemplar Level Types**
* #### <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/csp2-2023/lessons/1/levels/5?section_id=4722244">Reflection</a>
* #### <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/csp2-2023/lessons/6/levels/2?section_id=4722244">Reflection with bullet points</a>
* #### <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/csp1-2023/lessons/11/levels/2?section_id=4722244">Reflection with shaded text box</a>
* #### <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/csp2-2023/lessons/3/levels/2?section_id=4722244">Pick two true statements</a>
* #### <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/csp2-2023/lessons/5/levels/2?section_id=4722244">Multiple Choice</a>
* #### <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/csp2-2023/lessons/5/levels/3?section_id=4722244">Matching</a>
* #### <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/csp3-2023/lessons/1/levels/14?section_id=4722244">Matching Vocabulary</a>
* #### <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/csc-ecosystems-2023/lessons/1/levels/10">Matching with images</a>
* #### <a href="https://levelbuilder-studio.code.org/s/csc-playground/lessons/1/levels/13">Matching with GIFs</a>

#### There are also various types of coding based assessment levels including validated and unvalidated, <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/csa1-2023/lessons/5/levels/5"> choice levels</a>, or <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/coursef-2023/lessons/7/levels/1">prediction levels</a>.

### **Tips**
* #### Assessment levels can be used to break up level types. If there are a few text levels sequentially, you can use a multiple choice level in the middle. 
* #### If there are a lot of coding levels, you can break up the flow by adding screen shots of different solutions and asking, "Which one would work?" 
* #### In order for a learner to earn a certificate, they need to get a green bubble on every level in the course to get the certificate. Most of our multi/match levels allow you to keep trying until you get the right answer.
* #### Most assessment levels don't provide the opportunity to give the user feedback on why the correct answer was correct. Consider including an explanation level after the assessment level as modeled <a href="https://levelbuilder-studio.code.org/s/self-paced-pl-ai-101-mod2/lessons/1/levels/13" target="_blank">here</a>.
