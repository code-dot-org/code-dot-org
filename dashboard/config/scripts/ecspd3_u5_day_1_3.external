# Unit 5 Lessons > Days 1 - 3

## Concepts Covered

What is Data, room data collection, making a case/discovery, introduction to final project.

## Lesson Overview

This unit starts by looking at the final project right on day 1 so students can keep in mind what they will be working toward as they acquire the skills needed for the Unit 5 final project. They start off with a journal entry asking: **What is Big Data?** How big does a dataset need to be in order to be termed Big Data? Students then look at how data can be used for **making a case or a discovery**, and explore the pitfalls and challenges of putting together and managing large sets of data.

Students will be asked to **collect data about themselves for 3 days** and then are asked to merge their data with their peers. Although the activity is a little tricky, it sets the stage for getting students to address the need for asking good questions prior to collecting the data and **carefully designing the way the data will be collected** to make it most useful later. Â 

Some example topics along with great questions and raw data for final projects are included in the lesson, but you should consider the students in your class and what would be most appropriate for them. Potential topics include:

- School safety and bullying 
- Teen exercise and health 
- Teens, social media and online behavior
- Teens, video games and civic engagement

> ## Hints from an ECS Teacher:
> - When collecting personal inforamtion about students its important to be mindful of the realities in your class. For example, if some students do not always have access to food at home or have an eating disorder it is fine to alter the type of data collected to better suit your students.

## Things to keep in mind

Consider what real world experiences you can use to help your students relate with data and the world around them. What topics do you think might interest your students that you can use as a hook activity?
