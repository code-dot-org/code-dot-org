The _counter_ variable in the code below increments by 1 each time through the loop.  What will the value of _counter_ be after the following loop executes?

    var counter = 0;
    var n = 6;
    while(n > 0){
        n = n - 2;
        counter = counter + 1;
    }
    console.log(counter)

Going through the code line by line:

* The var _counter_ is set to 0
* The var _n_ is set to the value of 6
* The while loop will run as long as _n_ is greater than 0
* Inside the loop, _n_ is decreased by 2 and _counter_ is increased by 1 each time
* _n_ will equal 0 after it has looped 3 times and exit the loop
* Therefore, when _counter_ is displayed, 3 is printed to the console
