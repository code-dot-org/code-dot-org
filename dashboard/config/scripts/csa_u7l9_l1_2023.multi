Consider the following code segment.

```
public int largestNum(int[] arr) {
   int largest = 0;

   for (int i=0; i < arr.length; i++) {
      if (arr[i] > largest) {
         largest = arr[i];
      }
   }


   return largest;
}
```

The method `largestNum` is intended to return the value in the array `arr`. Which of the following best describes the conditions under which the method `largestNum` will not work as intended?

teacher_markdown <<MARKDOWN
If `arr` contains only negative values, the initialization of `largest` to `0` will cause `largest` to always be `0` and not the largest negative value in the array. Therefore, in this case, the method `largestNum` will not work as intended.
