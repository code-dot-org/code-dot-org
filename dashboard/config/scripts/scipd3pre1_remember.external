# Prep with Peers

Now that you've taken some time to prep your lessons, you probably have some questions.  Head over to to the Professional Learning Community to discuss your lesson plans with the rest of the group.  

## What's your plan for TLO? 

 - What module will you be teaching?
 - How would you present lesson 2?
 - What is your plan for lesson 3?
 - What activities are you most looking forward to?
 - Is there any place that you're feeling stuck?
 - What help can you offer to others?

<a href="http://forum.code.org/t/prep-with-peers/1748" target="blank"><h4><i class="fa fa-external-link-square"/> Discuss Your Lesson</h4></a>

When you're done, come back and continue with Phase 3 Online.
