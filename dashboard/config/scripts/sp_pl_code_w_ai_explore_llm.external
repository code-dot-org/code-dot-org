# Exploring Large Language Models 

#### There are many different large language models available. Let’s begin by exploring some of the most popular models. You may have experience with one or more of these LLMs. For this activity, feel free to explore one or all of them to get comfortable with how they work. 

#### **First, decide which LLM you want to start with.**

#### **Next, start exploring by chatting with the bot.** 

#### Spend about 10 - 15 minutes exploring the capabilities of the LLM of your choice. 

## Example Prompts: 

#### Here is a list of example prompts you can explore. Feel free to play around and be as creative as possible when chatting. 

#### **1.** Explain a [complex scientific concept] in a way that a middle school student can understand. *(For example: "Explain the theory of relativity in a way that is engaging for a 12-year-old.")*


#### **2.** Write a short narrative poem from the perspective of a historical figure. *(For example: "Write a poem from the perspective of Cleopatra about her relationship with Mark Antony.")*


#### **3.** Create a dialogue between two characters from a famous work of literature and discuss a contemporary issue. *(For example: "Write a conversation between Romeo and Juliet about social media and its impact on relationships.")* 


#### **4.** Plan a day trip itinerary for me in a nearby city, considering my interests in art and local cuisine. *(For example: "I want to explore a nearby city for a day trip. I love visiting museums and trying new foods. Craft a day trip itinerary for me!")*

## Tips and Tricks: 

- #### When you’re prompting the AI don’t just stop after the first prompt! Keep asking it more questions and diving deeper.
- #### Keep your critical thinking cap on. Use your better judgment and fact check anything that maybe doesn’t sound right.
