# Overview

You are going to get to turn your rectangular sprites into images for the first time! There will be lots of practice in this lesson of using images to create some simple animations including spinning gears, swimming fish, and a flying kite. You will be introduced to the mouse position for the first time. The mouse position will give user input to change the animations of your sprites.
