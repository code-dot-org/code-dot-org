# More Encryption Algorithms


In this curriculum, we have made the choice to use the Caesar Cypher, Viginère Cypher, and an asymmetric encryption to teach students about encryption and computationally hard problems.  This progression creates a story line of encryption schemes that are simple to create and simple to break, to simple to create but difficult to break.  The intention is to help students feel comfortable with how encryption works and then to give them a high level overview of ow encryption truly works on computers in the real world.  For CSP, this is as deep as they need to go. (We will discuss this in the next resource.)  However, if you’d like to delve further into the world of encryption, there are many resources on the internet to do just that!  Below are a few resources to get you started.
