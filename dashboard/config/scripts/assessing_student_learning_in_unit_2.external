# Assessing Student Learning in Unit 2

There are many assessment opportunities built into until 2, both formative and summative. See the graphic on the right for a snapshot of the assessments built in to unit 2. 


## Formative Assessments

In chapter 1 of the unit, students will use two widgets in Code Studio-- Text Compression and Pixelation. For lessons that use these two tools, there are a handful of formative assessment questions that can be used to check for understanding. 

The second chapter is focused digging into digital information in order to develop knowledge. In this chapter, there are formative assessment questions that relate back to specific tools or skills that are built here. 

In all cases you might choose to use these questions as exit tickets or measure to determine if it's necessary to reteach any material. 

## Summative Assessments
On the summative front, there are two types of assessments in unit 2: AP-style and practice performance tasks. 
<br><br>
The AP-style questions that assess the underlying learning objective, and therefore require students to transfer what they've learned to a new context. These questions were written to expose students to the types of questions they'll need to be able to answer in May on the AP exam. These AP-style assessments are found at the end of each chapter. 
<br><br>
The practice performance tasks are lessons 6 and 15. Lesson 6 digs into abstraction (though not through programming), which is a key part of the Create Task. Lesson 15 gives students an opportunity to create their own `Computational Artifact`, which is an element of the Explore Task.
