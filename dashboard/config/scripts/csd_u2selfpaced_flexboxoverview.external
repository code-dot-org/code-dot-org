# Flexbox Overview

#### In Lessons 12 and 13, students will learn about a CSS web layout model called **Flexbox**, or **Flex** for short. Flexbox is a powerful tool for organizing elements on a web page. Previous CSS properties focused on the style of elements, like color or size, while Flex focuses on where elements are placed on a page within **division (or div) containers**.

## What is a div Container?

#### A div container begins and ends with opening and closing div tags: `<div>` and `</div>`.

#### A div tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document. It allows developers to split their webpage into distinct sections, each capable of taking on unique styles through CSS. Divs go in the **body section of an HTML file**.

#### Div tags don't do anything by themselves, but they can take on properties in a CSS stylesheet.

## How Do I Use Flexbox?

#### Once your elements are set up in a div container, you can begin organizing it. Flex provides a more efficient way to lay out, align, and distribute space among items in a container.

#### All Flex properties are add to a CSS style sheet. They include:

* #### `display`
* #### `flex-direction`
* #### `flex-wrap`
* #### `justify-content`
* #### `align-items`
* #### `align-content`

#### Based on their names, what do you think these properties might do to the items within a div container?
