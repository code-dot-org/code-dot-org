# Sequencing > Reflect

Congratulations! You just wrote some code. You are officially a programmer! Code Studio will track how many lines of code you've written.

**Take a moment now to review how sequencing (including programming and algorithims) are introduced in the code.org curriculum.** As you explore the resources below, consider how you might implement the suggested activities in your classroom.

## Unplugged Lesson Plans

**1. Review "Happy Maps" Lesson Plan:** [Course 1](https://code.org/curriculum/course1/1/Teacher)

**2. Watch the student video: Happy Maps**
