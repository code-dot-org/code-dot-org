<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 18px; ">Through a series of design challenges <b>in the first half of the unit</b>, students are asked to consider and understand the needs of others while developing a solution to a problem. <b>The second half of the unit</b> consists of an iterative team project, during which students have the opportunity to identify a need that they care about, prototype solutions both on paper and in App Lab, and test their solutions with real users to get feedback and drive further iteration.

### **Students Will:**

* ##### See the design process as a form of problem solving that prioritizes the needs of a user.
* ##### Identify user needs and assess how well different designs address them. 
* ##### Develop paper and digital prototypes, gather and respond to feedback about a prototype, and consider ways different user interfaces do or do not affect the usability of their apps. 
* ##### Understand other roles in software development, such as product management, marketing, design, and testing, and how to use what they have learned about computer science as a tool for social impact.
