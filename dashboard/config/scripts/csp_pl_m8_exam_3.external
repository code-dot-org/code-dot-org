# Make your plan.

Now is your time to make your plan that will meet the needs of your students!  

## Before you start with your plan

* **Check your timing.** Look at where you are in the curriculum and how much time is left before the exam.  How are things looking for covering the content overall?  How much time do you have to review?  Consider putting this all in a calendar.
* **Prioritize what you want to work on with students.** Consider what resources have you already used or taken advantage of in your classroom. Which skills and content do you see your students needing the most support with?  How can you get the biggest “bang for your buck” when it comes to utilizing the review time?
* **Think about engagement.** How will you balance engagement and motivation during the end of the year?

## Do this:
To make your plan, go to your cohort’s shared slide deck for Module 8.  You will see a set of teal slides with a template for creating your plan.  Share your plan in the shared slides so others in our community can take a look at everyone's ideas!
