# Unit 6 Challenge > Understanding a Challenge

## What is a “challenge”?

A challenge is a focused activity in which you explore a lesson from the Exploring Computer Science curriculum as you prepare to teach it. You will complete the core activities from the lesson, read through the lesson plan, consider how you'll teach the lesson, and share that plan and your suggestions for how to use the lesson with other teachers through the <a href = "http://forum.code.org/c/ecs/ecs-unit6" target=_blank>forum</a>. 
 
> ## Why should I complete the challenge? 
> - **Prepare for teaching** - These challenges allow you to work through lessons with activities that might be tricky to teach without first going through them. You will also have time to look for outside resources that might help you teach the lesson, and then develop a plan for teaching it. You have the freedom to choose which lesson you will prepare, based on your personal teaching plan. 
- **Give and get feedback from other ECS teachers** - There isn't time in PD to have everyone do every lesson, but if everyone does some of the lessons in PD and then share experiences and ideas, you can all can learn from one another. 
- **Find great resources and support** - As you work together to share our plans and give feedback, you’ll be creating a library of ideas that will help everyone reach their goals with ECS.
