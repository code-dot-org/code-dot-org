# Image Types

## Assets 

* #### Use high-quality versions of any Code.org assets, such as Dance Party Characters.
* #### Request image files in the #design channel in Slack. 
* #### Use a mix of Code.org character illustrations and photos for adult audiences to avoid making your modules seem student-facing.

	* #### <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/PevJ6z5RCrj17HkRkBut67/Character-Illustrations?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=qZUUhs17wdOHslPh-0" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code.org Asset Figma Board</a> 

## Gifs

* #### Use gifs only when necessary to demonstrate directions for the learner or coding examples. 
	* #### Reduce the timing of the gif to ten seconds or fewer. 
    * #### Ensure that the gif runs slowly enough to illustrate your point.
* #### Use gifs for decorative purposes sparingly as they can distract the learner.
* #### Consider using banks like Giphy to source gifs.

## AI-Generated Images

* #### Start by searching for existing photos, visuals, and illustrations. AI-generated images can be used as necessary.
* #### Attribute AI-generated images appropriately, citing the image engine. Ideally, AI images should be generated by software that Code.org has a license for (such as ChatGPT).
	* #### Example:
    
    <img src="https://images.code.org/5f643df03b3565e7a1c367ae2a3b468b-image-1710871493815.04.49 AM.png" alt="A brown owl sits on a branch.">
    <br>
    
#### *Note. Image generated using Adobe Firefly from the prompt brown owl in a forest.*

## External Open-source Images

* #### Ask the #design channel on Slack for stock images for which we have a license if possible.
* #### For non-stock visuals, use open-source images and attribute the source.

## Images of Text 

* #### Avoid images of text wherever possible to aid in international translation.
* #### Certain images with text may not be converted into text-only. In this case, include the image text in the alt text. For example:

<img src="https://images.code.org/17b98c589b7c240abfb88ad026b93d2b-image-1707520567591.16.03 PM.png" style="width:300px; border-radius:30px; margin-left:15px; margin-right: 15px;" alt="A diagram of the Problem Solving Process shows the four steps: Define, Prepare, Try, and Reflect.">
