# Hard Problems - The Traveling Salesperson Problem

## Background

The traveling salesperson problem is a classic “computationally hard” computer science problem that has many applications in the real world. Whether it is a mailperson delivering letters to everyone in a neighborhood or you picking up all of your friends for a party, the task is to find the shortest – most optimal – route possible. It’s harder than it sounds! In fact, there is no perfect algorithm for all instances of the problem. And as the problem grows, a brute force strategy requires an unreasonable amount of time to solve. 

## Vocabulary

**Computationally hard** A problem for which there is no proven algorithm for solving in a reasonable time. The larger the problem set, the harder it is to solve by any means. The algorithm to solve must have exponential growth, one unit larger problem multiplies the number of answers to check by n. Sometimes these problems are called “intractable.” The goal in many of these problems is to find the best – most optimal – solution. 

## Lesson

* Determine the “best” route for a Traveling Salesperson Problem map.
* Discuss strategies for finding the shortest possible route.
* Discover how the size of the problem complicates the solution.
