# Predict Again!

**Debugging Event-Driven Programs: Logical Errors**

Sometimes you can write a program that generates no errors but does not work as you intend. This is the result of **logical errors** in your code.

Once again we've introduced an error or two (a logical error this time) for you to debug.

* **Investigate** - use the answer choices as clues for what to look for.
* **Make a prediction** - Select one of the answers below.
* **Run the program** and experiment to see what's wrong.
* **Reflect** - were you right?  Why or why not?
