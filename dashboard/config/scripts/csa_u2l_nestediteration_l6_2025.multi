teacher_markdown <<MARKDOWN
A `while` loop always make decisions about whether or not to run the code in the body of the loop.

While it is possible that the code inside the body of a `while` loop can run forever, multiple times, or only once based on the number of times the condition is `true`, this is not *always* the case.

It is also possible that the code inside the body of a `while` loop never runs if the condition is never `true`, this is not *always* the case.
