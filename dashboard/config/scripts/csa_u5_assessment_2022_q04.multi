Consider the following code segment.

```
int[][] arr = {{0, 1, 2, 3},
               {4, 5, 6, 7},
               {8, 9, 10, 11}};

int total = 0;

for (int[] j : arr) {
  for (int k = 1; k < j.length; k++) {
    total += j[k];
  }
}
```

What is the value of `total` as a result of executing the code segment?
