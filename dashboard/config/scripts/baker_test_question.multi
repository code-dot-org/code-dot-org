A teacher uses the following program to adjust student grades on an assignment by adding 5 points to each student's original grade. However, if adding 5 points to a student's original grade causes the grade to exceed 100 points, the student will receive the maximum possible score of 100 points. The students' original grades are stored in the list `gradeList`, which is indexed from 1 to n.
