# AI Literacy

#### As AI rapidly transforms our world, it's essential to equip students with a solid understanding of how AI works and how to effectively interact with it. Organizations like  <a href="https://ai4k12.org/" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI4K12</a>,  <a href="https://csteachers.org/" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CSTA</a>, and  <a href="https://www.teachai.org/" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Teach AI</a> are leading efforts to provide schools and teachers with resources to prepare students for the future. 

## 5 Big Ideas
#### These guidelines, from AI4K12 ensure that students engage with AI in a responsible and ethical manner and the **Exploring Generative AI** Curriculum aligns with these guidelines, offering a comprehensive approach to teaching students about AI.

                Agents use representations of the world for reasoning, a core challenge in both natural and artificial intelligence. While AI can handle complex reasoning tasks, it does so differently than human thought processes.

                Intelligent agents need extensive knowledge to interact naturally with humans, including language comprehension, emotion recognition, and understanding cultural norms. While current AI systems can handle language to some degree, they lack the general reasoning and conversational skills of even a young child.

                AI significantly influences society by transforming work, travel, communication, and caregiving, but it can also introduce risks like biased data impacting fairness. Therefore, itâ€™s crucial to address AI's societal effects and establish ethical guidelines for its design and use.
