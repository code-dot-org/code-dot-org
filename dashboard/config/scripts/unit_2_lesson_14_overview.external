# The Internet - Web Development: Lesson 14 - Sources and Search Engines

## Background

This lesson gives students a deeper understanding of how search engines work by having them take some time to design their own algorithms for determining the relevance and trustworthiness of a website. A video about how search works will help students see how some of the real world algorithms for searching work. Motivated by the desire to have their website found, students will update their websites to make them easier to find in searching.
