First, let's explore the first lesson in the unit. To begin, find your ECS Version 5 curriculum and open to page 136-138.

#### Key Concepts

- Students will be introduced to the Scratch Programming Language. They will create sprites and make them do simple movements on screen.

#### Common Difficulties

This lesson was one that was presented at the in person workshop. It connects students back to writing algorithms, the problem solving process and storyboarding.
<br><br>
Many students have worked in Scratch previously or have seen it.  They may feel like it is an environment for younger students and that they are not really programming.  This is not true.  They are gaining experience writing algorithms that the computer will need to understand, with a language that is more equitable to all students, especially students new to computer science.
<br><br>
Remind students that using a drag and drop language allows them to shift their focus away from syntax and allows them to do more "tinkering" and modification quickly.  They are also able to have a more visual product which can be gratifying.
<br><br>
You will need to download the Scratch files ahead of time to demo them and make them available to your students.
