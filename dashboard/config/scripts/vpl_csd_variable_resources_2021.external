#Using Resources


In the next activity you will debug code that has variable naming errors. There are resources available for students to use if they have a difficult time finding the bugs. There is also a teacher only resource that teachers can use to help formulate guiding questions to help students when they get stuck. Explore these resources before completing the activity.
