What is the purpose of the following method?

```
public boolean mystery(int[] nums) {
  boolean result = true;

  for (int index = 0; index < nums.length; index++) {
     if ((nums[index] % 2) == 1) {
      result = false;
    }
  }

  return result;
}
```
MARKDOWN

teacher_markdown <<MARKDOWN
This method declares a `boolean` variable called `result` to keep track of the result of executing the method, and the `for` loop then traverses through each element of the 1D array `nums`.

In the body of the `for` loop, the condition of the `if` statement (`nums[index] % 2 == 1`) checks if the remainder after dividing the current value by `2` equals `1`. If the condition is `true`, the variable `result` is set to `false`.

If any of the values in the 1D array `nums` is odd (has a remainder of `1` after dividing it by `2`), then the value `false` is returned. Otherwise, the value `true` is returned.
