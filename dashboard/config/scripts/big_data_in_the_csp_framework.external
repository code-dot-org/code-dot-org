# Big Data in the CSP Framework

The Curriculum Framework deliberately doesn't talk about "Big Data", in part because the definition is fairly contentious. Instead, the framework references 'large data sets', the impact they have on society, and how they can be used to discover information and knowledge.

Lessons 1 - 4 cover many learning objectives from across the big ideas of Data and Impact. Specifically: 

**Enduring Understanding 3.2 - Computing facilitates exploration and the discovery of connections in information.**

- 3.2.2 - Use large data sets to explore and discover information and knowledge. [P3]
 - 3.2.2A - Large data sets include data such as transactions, measurements, text, sound, images, and video.
 - 3.2.2B - The storing, processing, and curating of large data sets is challenging.
 - 3.2.2C - Structuring large data sets for analysis can be challenging.
 - 3.2.2D - Maintaining privacy of large data sets containing personal information can be challenging.
 - 3.2.2E - Scalability of systems is an important consideration when data sets are large.
 - 3.2.2F - The size or scale of a system that stores data affects how that data set is used.
 - 3.2.2G - The effective use of large data sets requires computational solutions.
 - 3.2.2H - Analytical techniques to store, manage, transmit, and process data sets change as the size of data sets scale.

**Enduring Understanding 3.3 - There are trade offs when representing information as digital data.**

- 3.3.1 - Analyze how data representation, storage, security, and transmission of data involve computational manipulation of information. [P4]
 - 3.3.1A - Digital data representations involve trade offs related to storage, security, and privacy concerns.
 - 3.3.1B - Security concerns engender tradeoffs in storing and transmitting information.
 - 3.3.1F - Security and privacy concerns arise with data containing personal information.

**Enduring Understanding 7.3 - Computing has a global affect -- both beneficial and harmful -- on people and society.**

- 7.3.1 - Analyze the beneficial and harmful effects of computing. [P4]
 - 7.3.1A - Innovations enabled by computing raise legal and ethical concerns.
 - 7.3.1G - Privacy and security concerns arise in the development and use of computational systems and artifacts.
 - 7.3.1J - Technology enables the collection, use, and exploitation of information about, by, and for individuals, groups, and institutions.
 - 7.3.1K - People can have instant access to vast amounts of information online; accessing this information can enable the collection of both individual and aggregate data that can be used and collected.
 - 7.3.1L - Commercial and governmental curation of information may be exploited if privacy and other protections are ignored.
 - 7.3.1M - Targeted advertising is used to help individuals, but it can be misused at both individual and aggregate levels.
 - 7.3.1N - Widespread access to digitized information raises questions about intellectual property.

**Enduring Understanding 7.5 - An investigative process is aided by effective organization and selection of resources. Appropriate technologies and tools facilitate the accessing of information and enable the ability to evaluate the credibility of sources.**

- 7.5.2 - Evaluate online and print sources for appropriateness and credibility [P5]
 - 7.5.2A - Determining the credibility of a soruce requires considering and evaluating the reputation and credentials of the author(s), publisher(s), site owner(s), and/or sponsor(s).
 - 7.5.2B - Information from a source is considered relevant when it supports an appropriate claim or the purpose of the investigation
