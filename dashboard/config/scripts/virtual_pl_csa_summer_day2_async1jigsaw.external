# Lesson Investigation 

##### Now that we have had a chance to see some of the lessons in action and look under the hood at the philosophy behind Code.orgâ€™s CSA, we are going to shift to giving you time to explore these resources for yourself.

##### You will use the lesson investigation resource on pages 41-43 of your [Activity Packet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13Ioyv4xcUUunhZ9034eNvm9QNpRYQYnyha1UtS5eixA/edit?usp=sharing) to complete this activity. Complete only one of the four lesson investigation documents

## Lessons Investigation Jigsaw

*  ###### U1L11 - Selection Statements
*  ###### U1L12 - Debugging
*  ###### U1L13 - Decomposition and design
*  ###### U1L14 - Two-way selection statements

## Do this:

* ##### Spend 25 minutes exploring the lesson plan then lesson for your assigned lesson.
* ##### Spend 20 minutes deconstructing the lesson using the lesson investigation resource.
* ##### Be prepared to share tomorrow morning.  

### **Suggested time:** 50 minutes

## Let's get started!
