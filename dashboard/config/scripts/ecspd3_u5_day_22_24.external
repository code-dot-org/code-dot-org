#### Lesson Overview

Students will be introduced to text data and then work with subsets of text.  The file they will start with is called 'jillamore.pdf', which they will work with to plot location on a map.  They will then load a weather data file and navigate through the file to provide an explanation of what the variables are. After that they load a twitter data file, which they will learn is too large to use, so they should create a subset of the data for a specific region to focus on looking at.
<br><br>
In this lesson you will help students learn how to use a variety of filters, queries and text mining to create subsets of text data and to create bar charts or wordles (word clouds) for graphical display.

##### Other Resources

- Word Clouds
	- **Good for:** Visualizing the frequency of words in a chunk of text, with more frequent words given more emphasis by being shown in a larger size
	- <a href="http://www.wordclouds.com/" target=_blank>http://www.wordclouds.com/</a>
	- <a href="http://www.wordle.net" target=_blank>http://www.wordle.net</a>
		
>#### Hints from an ECS Teacher
	
>- As you get to part II – Focusing on the Words:  you can use check your word cloud tool to see if it can automatically remove Stop Words (“Remove Common Words”) and combines similar words (“Combine Related Words”).
