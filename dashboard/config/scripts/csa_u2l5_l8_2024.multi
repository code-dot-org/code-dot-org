MARKDOWN

teacher_markdown <<MARKDOWN
`Teacher` is a subclass of `Person`. The `Teacher` class can add additional methods and instance variables.

While the `Teacher` class inherits the attributes and behaviors of the `Person` class, it does not inherit the constructors.

Since the `Person` class is the superclass, does not inherit anything from the subclass. Additionally, it cannot access the instance variables in the `Teacher` class.
