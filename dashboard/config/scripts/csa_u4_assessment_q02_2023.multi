Consider the following code segment.

```
double x = 1.5;
int y = (int) x * 2;
double z = y;

System.out.println(y + " " + z);
```

What is printed as a result of executing the code segment?
MARKDOWN

teacher_markdown <<MARKDOWN
The variable `y` is assigned the value `2`. The `(int)` casting operator is applied to the value assigned to `x`, so `1` is used instead of `1.5` for `x`. The `int` value is then multiplied by `2`, resulting in `1 * 2`, or `2`, being assigned to `y`.

The line `double z = y;` then widens the value assigned to `y` to a `double` value, so `z` is assigned the value `2.0`.

As a result, `2` is printed for `y` and `2.0` is printed for `z`.
