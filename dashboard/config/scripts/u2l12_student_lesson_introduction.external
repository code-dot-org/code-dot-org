# Unit 2: Lesson 12 - The Internet and Society

You've learned about the physical nature of networks: Internet Protocols, routing, packets, scaling, redundancy, reliability, DNS, and HTTP. Now you will get a chance to investigate how these technologies have connections to the social impacts of the internet.  You will research an area of focus under one of three major topics
