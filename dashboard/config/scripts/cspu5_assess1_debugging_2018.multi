Debugging a program by printing out the current values with console.log and seeing what the program is internally doing at a certain moment will be helpful. Asking for help from another person is also a good way of debugging, especially if you've been working on your code for a long time and need a fresh pair of eyes.

On the other hand, changing variable names will not help because you are only renaming the problem rather than finding and fixing the problem. Computers read code line by line, so rewriting chunks of code is the same as rewriting the same problem.
