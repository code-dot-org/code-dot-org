# Getting Started > About this Online PD

## Pre-requisites

For success in this online PD, we assume that you have participated in a three-day face-to-face CS in Algebra training this summer. 

## Learning objectives

Through completing this online PD, you will:

- Build on your understanding of the Code.org CS in Algebra curriculum
- Use and apply Code Studio tools, including new tools and features introduced since the summer PD ended

## Course duration

Completing this online PD should take about 2-6 hours, depending on your prior knowledge and how deeply you want to dive into the resources provided.

## Course timeline

This online professional development is not designed to be a sequential online course. Instead, it is designed to serve as a reference to you throughout the 2015-16 school year as you plan, and deliver the CS in Algebra curriculum. 

Please work through the stages and levels that follow at your own pace. Make your own choices about how deep to go in any particular level or stage, based on:

- Which units, activities and tools from the curriculum you plan to implement in your classroom
- Your own understanding of your learning and support needs

Create your own schedule for learning, but at minimum, **plan to finish all the stages and levels in this online PD before the end of the school year.** 

## Important reminder

If you are participating in this online PD through your district’s partnership with Code.org, you will be held accountable for earning a “green dot” for each level in this online PD. This means that you are required to click the orange “Continue” button at the bottom of each level. You can check your progress at any time by clicking the “down arrow” at the top of the screen.

**Keep in mind:** this online PD is not designed to be completed sequentially, but instead to serve as an on-going reference and support to you throughout the year. Be sure to click “Continue” whenever you use a level; this will help you keep track throughout the year of what you’ve completed and what you still need to review.

Click the “Continue” button below to review tips for using this online learning space.
