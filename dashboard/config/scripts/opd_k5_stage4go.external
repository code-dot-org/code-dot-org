# Loops > Unplugged Lessons

In this stage, we saw how adding loops to a program is more efficient when coding repetitive actions. In the next stage, we'll look at coding **if-statements** and other conditionals.  
<br/>

**1. Review "[Getting Loopy](https://levelbuilder.code.org/curriculum/coursec/7/Teacher)" Lesson Plan from Course C:**
<br/>Course C is meant for Grade 2 students. Loops comes up in other courses, as well, and you can find examples of those lessons at the bottom of this page.

<br/>

**2. Watch the student video: Getting Loopy**
<br/>
This is a video that you would show your students to help introduce the concept of loops and kick off the unplugged lesson.

**3. Watch the teacher video: How to facilitate "Getting Loopy"**
<br/>
This video is meant to be support for you as the teacher, if you are looking for tips on how to run this lesson.

**4. Review other unplugged lessons that introduce loops:**

- Course A (Kindergarten): [Happy Loops](https://curriculum.code.org/csf-18/coursea/9/)
- Course B (Grade 1): [My Loopy Robotic Friends Jr.](https://curriculum.code.org/csf-18/courseb/8/)
- Course E, F (Grade 4, 5): [My Loopy Robotic Friends](https://curriculum.code.org/csf-18/coursee/6/)
