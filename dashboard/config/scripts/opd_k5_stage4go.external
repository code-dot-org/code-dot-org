# Loops > Reflection

In this stage, we saw how adding loops to a program is more efficient when coding repetitive actions. In the next stage, we'll look at coding conditionals or "if-statements". **Take a moment now to review how loops are introduced in the code.org curriculum.** As you explore the resources below, consider how you might implement the suggested activities in your classroom.

## Unplugged Lesson Plans

**1. Review "Getting Loopy" Lesson Plan:** [Course 1](https://code.org/curriculum/course1/12/Teacher), [Course 2](https://code.org/curriculum/course2/5/Teacher)

**2. Watch the student video: Getting Loopy**
