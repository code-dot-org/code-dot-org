#CSA Unit 2 Project Examples

[Student Example 1](https://studio.code.org/projects/javalab/qIrTPWqxKiMGE2pm66JfETeBunX-aQeNJIb-IePwzCU)

[Student Example 2](https://studio.code.org/projects/javalab/o23zxdkFfDRz79mFmG6bH1K1kLVOdUyj1PG3bWqrmUE)

[Student Example 3](https://studio.code.org/s/csa2-pilot/lessons/13/levels/1?section_id=3591632&user_id=61856404): While this student did a good job of creating the classes correctly (including using super in the toString method), the test code doesn't reflect understanding of creating objects for different classes. This student typically immediately understands coding concepts but sometimes skips directions or forgets parts of assignments.

[Student Example 4](https://studio.code.org/s/csa2-pilot/lessons/13/levels/1?section_id=3591632&user_id=81709961): This business calculates the price for playing different sports at The Court, and does a good job of demonstrating the differences between each class. This student works hard to stay at the top of the class.

[Student Example 5](https://studio.code.org/s/csa2-pilot/lessons/13/levels/1?section_id=3591632&user_id=81709566): This business builds minecraft animals. It tries to demonstrate the differences between classes and allows the user to change a value but doesn't show the before / after comparison.
