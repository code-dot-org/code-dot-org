# Unit 6 Overview

## Concepts

As we dive into the final unit, we continue to see the spiral of the curriculum where students are reinforcing and applying the skills they’ve learned in past units now with robotics. Students will have the opportunity to use their problem solving and programming skills to have a fun experience working with Lego Mindstorm robots. 

The LEGO software they will work with is a drag and drop type of software with some additional depth than the Scratch environment used in unit 4. Students will need to troubleshoot both the programs that run on their robots, as well as the physical construction of the robot, in order to make the robot perform the task or challenge given.

NOTE: If you don't have robots for Unit 6, we will discuss alternate activities: other robot options, online robot simulated environments, culminating projects or portfolios in stage 4.
