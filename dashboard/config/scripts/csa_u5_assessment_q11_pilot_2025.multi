Consider the following code segment:

```
int[][] arr = {{0, 1, 2}, {3, 4, 5}, {6, 7, 8}};
int[][] ret = new int[arr.length][arr[0].length];

for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  for (int j = 0; j < arr[0].length; j++) {
    ret[i][j] = arr[i][arr[0].length - j - 1];
  }
}

System.out.println(ret[2][2]);
```

What is printed as a result of running this code segment?

Within the inner loop, the line `ret[i][j] = arr[i][arr[0].length - j - 1];` assigns the value of the corresponding element from `arr` to the mirrored position in `ret`. This mirroring is achieved by using `arr[0].length - j - 1` as the column index.

To break it down further:
* When `i = 0` and `j = 0`, `ret[0][0]` is assigned the value of `arr[0][2]`, which is 2.

* When `i = 0` and `j = 1`, `ret[0][1]` is assigned the value of `arr[0][1]`, which is 1.

* When `i = 0` and `j = 2`, `ret[0][2]` is assigned the value of `arr[0][0]`, which is 0.

* The same pattern continues for the other elements of `arr` and `ret`.

After the loops, the code prints `ret[2][2]`, which corresponds to the element at the third row and third column of the `ret` array.

Since `ret[2][2]` is assigned the value of `arr[2][0]`, which is `6`, the output will be `"6"`.
