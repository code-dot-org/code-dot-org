# What is a game jam?

#### A game jam is a creative event where people come together in teams to make video games based on a chosen theme within a limited amount of time.




## Why Game Jams?
#### Game developers participate in game jams to foster creativity and innovation, develop skills rapidly, network and collaborate with peers, build their portfolios, and boost productivity through focused, deadline-driven work. These events also provide a supportive community for feedback and are a fun way for developers to express their passion for game creation in a spirited environment.
