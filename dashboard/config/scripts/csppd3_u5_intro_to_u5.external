# Unit 5 Overview > What's Covered?

## Concepts

Unit 5 is all about data.  The role of data and data visualization is becoming more impactful on society, and your students are going to become comfortable with techniques for extracting knowledge from data and visualizing that data during this unit. Here students will build research questions and collect data in order to answer questions and build knowledge.

Students will do this by first deciding what story they want to tell, then by researching their topic, deciding the appropriate questions to ask, and posing their questions to start the data gathering process.  Once they have gathered their data they will analyze it.  Data analysis is the process of interpreting the meaning of the data we have collected, organized, and displayed in the form of a table, bar chart, line graph, or other representation. The process involves looking for patterns—similarities, disparities, trends, and other relationships—and thinking about what these patterns might mean.

We will also want to check data against other sources to verify truths, draw conclusions, and be able to then tell a story and report findings via a website or Scratch project.
