# Paper Prototypes

>### **Key Vocabulary**
>* ##### **Prototype** - A first or early model of a product that allows you to test assumptions before developing a final version.
> * ##### **User Interface** - The visual elements of a program through which a user controls or communicates with the application. Often abbreviated UI.

##### Throughout the Design Process unit, students will use **paper prototypes** as a quick tool to kick off the development of an app. Paper prototypes are used by designers in many industries to create low-stakes, low-cost first drafts of their final products. Check out some real-world examples below:
