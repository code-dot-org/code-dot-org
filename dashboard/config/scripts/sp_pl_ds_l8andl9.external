# Cleaning and Interpreting Data 


#### In the next lessons, students will learn how to clean raw data to make it useful and explore how different visualizations can change our understanding of that data. They'll practice making decisions, discuss the challenges and biases that can arise, and work together to critically analyze and present data.

#### In this lesson, students explore how raw data can hinder insights and practice data cleaning decisions. 
#### They conclude with a discussion on tradeoffs that can introduce bias and inaccuracy.

#### This lesson explores how different data visualizations shape our understanding by highlighting trends, patterns, and outliers. 
#### Students create visualizations, then collaborate to discuss insights and ethical considerations in data presentation.

> #### **Key Concepts:**
> - #### **bell curve** - a symmetric, bell-shaped curve with most data points clustered around the center
> - #### **bimodal curve** - shows a distribution with two distinct peaks
> - #### **data cleaning** - the process of making data useful by deleting doubles or blanks, creating categories, and editing spelling errors
> - #### **measures of center** - represent the central point or typical value of a data set
> - #### **shape of distribution** - how data values are spread out and how they form a pattern when visualized on a graph
> - #### **skewed distribution** - occurs when the data stretches out more on one side than the other
> - #### **outlier** - a data point that significantly differs from other data points
> - #### **pattern** - a consistent or recurring sequence that can be observed and predicted
> - #### **trend** - the general direction in which data points are heading over a period of time
