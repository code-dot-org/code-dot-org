# Designing for Accessibility

* In the world of computer science, **accessibility** is about creating technology for people with disabilities.
* Disabilities include physical, auditory, visual, and many others.
* Disabilities are diverse and impact people in different ways, including how they use technology like **smartphone apps**.
* Designing apps that are accessible for people with disabilities makes those apps better for everyone else as well!
