How do you know when you're frustrated?  When you get frustrated, you might feel like you're mad.  Maybe you think you're mad at your teacher.  Maybe mad at yourself. Maybe you think you're mad at your project.  If you step back and see that you're upset because something is too hard, CONGRATULATIONS! You're frustrated! And that's great.
