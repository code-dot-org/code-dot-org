## Content Overview

Unit 4 begins by asking students to consider what data can be collected and to propose ways it could be used to **test hypotheses and develop new insights** about the world. Students will also begin collecting data about themselves by making daily entries into a survey that will be used as part of the Class Data Tracker project that runs through the entirety of the first chapter.

Students will be introduced to the power of **data visualization** as a tool for finding, understanding, and presenting trends in data. They will use interactive data visualization tools to identify trends and patterns, learn to identify assumptions made when interpreting visualizations, and critique data visualizations based on their clarity and usefulness.

Having developed intuitions on how to use visualizations to help interpret data, students will begin creating visualizations of their own. They will learn how to use a spreadsheet tool to create a variety of charts of digital data. They will also be introduced to the way **summary tables** provide new perspectives on a data set by grouping and aggregating information.

For the remainder of the chapter students will be working with the data collected with the Class Data Tracker they began using at the beginning of the unit. In preparing the data for analysis they will learn why **cleaning data** is an important step in analysis. They will learn to make summary tables of their own using the **pivot table** tools included in most spreadsheet software, and will use this skill to search for trends and patterns within the data they have collected.

To conclude the chapter students will complete a Practice PT in which they visualize and present an interesting trend, pattern, or relationship they found within their tracker data.

## What it looks like

Students will use computer for most lessons in this chapter. At the beginning of the unit students will be looking at external tools or resources to familiarize themselves with the ways data and data visualization are used. In the second half of the chapter they will be working primarily in a **spreadsheet tool (e.g. Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, etc.)**. While the Practice PT itself should be completed individually, the lessons leading up to that project including cleaning and summarizing the data lends itself much more readily to group work and class discussions.
