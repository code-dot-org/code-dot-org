# Review

We have learned a lot of new things so far. Before we jump into further exmaples take a second and read this review of the things we have covered so far.

# Programming Basics

* When we draw shapes on the computer we give commands in order, 1 command per a line. 
* That order can become very important when the two shapes are overlapping as the one drawn first will go behind the other.

# Drawing Area Rules

* 400 by 400
* (0,0) is in the upper left corner
* X gets bigger from left to right
* Y gets bigger from top to bottom
* All X and Y values are positive on the drawing area
