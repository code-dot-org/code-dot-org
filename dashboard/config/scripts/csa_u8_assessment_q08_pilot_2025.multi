Consider the following method, which implements a recursive binary search that returns an index in `arr` where the value `x` appears if `x` appears in `arr` between `arr[left]` and `arr[right]`, inclusive; otherwise returns `-1`.

```
public static int bSearch(int[] arr, int left, int right, int x) {
  if (right >= left) {
    int mid = (left + right) / 2;

    if (arr[mid] == x) {
      return mid;
    }
    else if (arr[mid] > x) {
      return bSearch(arr, left, mid - 1, x);
    }
    else {
      return bSearch(arr, mid + 1, right, x);
    }
  }

  return -1;
}
```

The following code segment appears in a method in the same class as `bSearch`.

```
int[] nums = {20, 30, 30, 60, 70, 90};
int result = bSearch(nums, 0, nums.length - 1, 30);
```

What is the value of `result` after the code segment has been executed?

Let's step through the code to understand why:

1. The array `nums` is initialized with the values `{20, 30, 30, 60, 70, 90}`.

2. The `bSearch` method is called with the array `nums`, `left = 0`, `right = nums.length - 1`, and `x = 30`.

3. In the first call to `bSearch`, the condition `right >= left` is satisfied, as `right` is `5` and `left` is `0`.

4. The midpoint `mid` is calculated as `(left + right) / 2`, which gives `(0 + 5) / 2 = 2`.

5. The value at index `mid` in the array `nums` is checked against the target `x` (`30`). Since the condition `arr[mid] == x` is `true` (`nums[mid]` is 30 and `x` is 30), the method returns `mid`, which is `2`.

6. The value `2` is assigned to the variable `result`.

Therefore, after the code segment has been executed, the value of `result` is `2`, indicating that the target value of `30` is found at index `2` in the array `nums`.
