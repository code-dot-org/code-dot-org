#### Key Concepts

- Students will create their own timing game and participate in an Arcade Day where they will have the opportunity to share their game with their peers.

#### Common Difficulties

Students may want to create an elaborate game that you might not know how to help them with.  Remember that you may want to review the problem solving process, writing a storyboard for their game and then having them write the algorithm for their program to get started. You can also have them get help from other students.

It would be best to have students start with at basic idea or prototype for their game and then work on adding extensions as they can see success and time allows.
