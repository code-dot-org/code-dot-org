When does the module best fit into what you are already teaching?

##### **Consider co-teaching** 
What colleagues (e.g. librarian, technology specialist, general education) may want to teach lessons with you?

##### **Make modifications or accomodations**
How will you adapt the lessons to best meet your students' needs?

When will student-led learning happen for individual students or pairs?

##### **Keep the end in mind**
