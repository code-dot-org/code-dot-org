#### About our Middle and High School Courses

Code.org also offers semester- and year-long middle and high school curriculum, although this curriculum is not linked to Code Studio at this time. You can access the curriculum through the links below:

**Middle school (Grades 6-8)**

- [CS in Algebra](http://code.org/curriculum/algebra/): Learn how computer programmers use algebra and geometry to develop video games
- [CS in Science](http://code.org/curriculum/science/): Explore and develop complex scientific models through agent-based programming

**High school (Grades 9-12)**

- [Exploring Computer Science](http://www.exploringcs.org/): A high school course designed to broaden participation in computer science
- [Computer Science Principles (future AP)](http://code.org/educate/csp): A course teaching a wide range of computer science topics, including programming in JavaScript

More in-depth professional development on these curricula are available through our district partnerships program. If you're interested in becoming a district partner, please [visit this page for more information](http://code.org/educate/districts).

#### About Other Code Studio Activities

While the activities below do not have accompanying lesson plans or curricula for teachers, they can make great self-paced learning activities for students of all ages. They're also great resources for you as you continue learning to code:

- [Hour of Code](http://studio.code.org/s/hourofcode/reset)
- [Frozen](http://studio.code.org/s/frozen/reset)
- [Infinity Play Lab](http://studio.code.org/s/infinity/reset)
- [Flappy Code](http://studio.code.org/s/flappy/reset)

#### Other Curriculum Resources

Do our resources above not meet your needs? No problem! Through partnerships with other organizations, code.org is pleased to recommend other curriculum resources for teachers. [Check out the full list](http://code.org/educate/3rdparty) and find something that works for you.


#### About our accelerated Intro to CS course (10-18+)

In addition to Courses 1-4, Code.org offers [an accelerated all ages online course with a complimentary curriculum](http://studio.code.org/s/20-hour). This 20-hour course covers the core computer science and programming concepts in courses 2-4. The course is designed for use with ages 10-18 who need to work at a faster pace or who have less time to learn computer science. Courses 2-4 offer a more complete experience, so we recommend you prioritize teaching those courses when possible.
