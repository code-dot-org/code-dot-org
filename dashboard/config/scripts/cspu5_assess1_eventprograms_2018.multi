**Content: Unit 5 Lesson 1**

An "Event-driven program" is a program that runs in relation to an event, such as user actions (mouse clicks, button presses, etc.) Depending on what the event is, multiple functions can be run in a certain order (as an algorithm) to execute a task. Or, a program can run with a specific flow depending on the event. This flow can be determined with a written algorithm.

For example, a program is written to fix the size of an image by making it bigger with a click of a button. When the button is clicked, there can be code inside the event block that implements an algorithm that adds 10 pixels onto the current image.
