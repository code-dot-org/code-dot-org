[Keylogging App](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/A0gYPPIRfBsS_5fHz6VzZTZoefZe2zwzJcijd4vuGAs)
Click run and then start typing. Click "Check" to see what has been logged since the app started running. 


**Note:** This is an approximation of what a keylogging app does. However, it is not a true keylogger, as it only works when you are directly running the app. If you navigate to another browser tab, notice that it stops logging your keystrokes.
