# Getting Started > About this Online PD

This online professional development is designed to support you in delivering content from Unit 2 of the ECS Version 5 curriculum. By working through the stages and levels that follow, you will:

- Develop a deep understanding of the core concepts covered in the ECS version 5 curriculum, specifically Unit 2
- Explore teaching strategies that support success delivering Unit 2
- Prepare, plan and share at least one lesson from Unit 2, tailored to your classroom and your needs
- Connect with the Code.org ECS community for addtional support throughout Unit 2

## Pre-requisites

For success in this online PD, we assume that you have participated in a five-day face-to-face ECS training this summer. During your  in-person workshop, you spent time planning and experiencing lessons from Unit 2. In this online PD, we're going to spend time looking over those lessons that weren't explored during the workshop and consider the resources and materials that will be helpful in planning and delivering Unit 2.

## Course duration

Completing this online PD should take about 3 hours, depending on your prior knowledge and how deeply you want to dive into the resources provided. 

## Course timeline

This online professional development is **not** designed to be a sequential online course. Instead, it is designed to serve as a reference to you throughout the school year as you plan, and deliver Unit 2 of the ECS Version 5 curriculum. 

> Please work through the stages and levels that follow at your own pace. Make your own choices about how deep to go in any particular level or stage, based on:

> - Which lessons from the curriculum you plan to implement in your classroom
> - Your own understanding of your learning and support needs
