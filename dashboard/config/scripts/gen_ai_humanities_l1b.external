## Story Idea Generation

**Task:** Generate three creative story ideas for a science fiction short story.

### Steps

1. **Understanding the task:** You will be crafting a prompt that asks an AI tool to generate three creative story ideas for a science fiction short story.

2. **Crafting your prompt:** Start by deciding on the specific aspects you want the AI to focus on. These might include themes (e.g., survival, exploration), settings (e.g., distant planets, future Earth), or characters (e.g., robots, aliens).

   Consider how specific you need to be to get the type of story ideas you want.

3. **Writing your prompt:** Write a prompt that is clear and specific. Here is an example to get you started:

> Generate three creative story ideas for a science fiction short story. Each idea should include a unique setting, an interesting protagonist, and a central conflict related to advanced technology or space exploration.

4. **Using the AI tool:** Enter your prompt into the AI tool, and review the response. Assess whether they meet your expectations and include the elements you specified.

5. **Evaluate the response:** Consider the following questions when evaluating the AI's response:

   * Are the story ideas creative and engaging?
   
   * Do the ideas include unique settings, interesting protagonists, and central conflicts?
   
   * Are the themes, settings, and characters appropriate for a science fiction genre?

6. **Refining your prompt:** If the AI's response is not as expected, think about how you can improve your prompt. You might need to add more detail or be more specific about what you want.

   Adjust your prompt and try again until you get a satisfactory response.
