## Overview

##### In small groups, students conduct research using articles and videos that expose ethical pitfalls in an Artificial Intelligence (AI) area of their choice. Afterward, each group develops at least one solution-oriented principle that addresses their chosen area. These principles are then assembled into a class-wide “Our AI Code of Ethics” resource (e.g. a slide presentation, document, or webpage) for AI creators and legislators everywhere.

## Objectives

##### * Create at least one guiding principle that addresses an AI ethics issue.
##### * Define artificial intelligence (AI) in their own words, using technologies they encounter in their daily lives as examples.
##### * Describe at least one example of an ethical issue pertaining to AI, along with its impact on society.
