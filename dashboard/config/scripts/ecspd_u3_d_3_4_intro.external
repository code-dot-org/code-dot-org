#### Key Concepts

1. Students will create a storyboard for a website that includes a title, several paragraphs, and headings for each paragraph

2. Students will create an html page with a title, body, paragraphs, headings, line breaks and horizontal lines

#### Common Difficulties

Leaning to create web pages can be overwhelming when you are new to computer science.  To help you out we have found a great web based html editor that works for both mac and pc.  It is, the jSFiddle pogramming environment - [https://jsfiddle.net/](https://jsfiddle.net/). (The curriculum uses [w3schools.com](http://www.w3schools.com) which is another option.) You can choose which one works best for you.
