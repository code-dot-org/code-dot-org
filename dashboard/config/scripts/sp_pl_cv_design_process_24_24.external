#### The **Design Thinking Process** involves five steps that teams use to understand users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems, and create innovative solutions. 

## Cyclical Design Process 

#### Students will use this process throughout this unit as they work towards developing a prototype for a computer vision product. It involves understanding users, defining problems, brainstorming solutions, creating prototypes, and testing them while emphasizing a **user-centric mindset**.

## Why use this process?

#### By practicing these steps, students will learn to continuously improve their ideas and ultimately develop their own prototypes. This cyclical process helps students build creativity and problem-solving skills in a practical, hands-on way.
