# How to Use AI

#### There are a myriad of ways you can use AI to support your role as an educator. Here is a list of a few examples from teachers who have leveraged AI to enhance their teaching practices.

* #### “Compose emails to parents, proofread emails, assist in writing tests…”
* #### “Write lessons, create quizzes and to rewrite the standards into grade level language for my students and their parents.”
* #### “Help formulate writing rubrics for my English classes.”
* #### “...Create a lesson plan outline or formulate questions.”
* #### “...to help teach lessons that I have taught in the past but add more hands-on learning!”

#### Before you start using LLMs (Large Language Models) it's crucial to consider privacy and data security concerns. LLMs can inadvertently store and reveal personal information input during interactions. Educators should confirm their LLM usage complies with educational data protection laws such as FERPA or COPPA.

#### In short, treat data or information you enter into an LLM as public. Don’t include personal information for yourself, colleagues, or students when prompting or chatting with an LLM and caution your students to do the same.

#### We cover this topic in more depth in the Ensuring a Responsible Approach to AI module.
