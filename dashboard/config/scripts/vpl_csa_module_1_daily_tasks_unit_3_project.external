# Reviewing the Unit 3 Project

*Goal: To understand the options students have when starting the Unit 3 project.*

After students develop question based on the user story they select, students:

* Create a UML diagram for their new class
* Identify and write pseudocode for one or more methods they will write in their class
* Start to develop their class 

As you consider what this process looks like in your classroom, it can be helpful to understand what happens on each day of the project.

By the end of the "three-day" project, students will have finished their activity guide and written their program.
