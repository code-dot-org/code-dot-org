## Practice Question

The following procedure was developed to determine if a list contains a negative number. If the list contains a negative number it should return true, otherwise it should return false.

An error was made in writing this function so that it does not work as intended. Which line of code would need to be fixed in order for the function to work as designed?

```
01 PROCEDURE checkNegative(list)
02 {
03  hasNegative <- true
04    FOR EACH number IN list
05    {
06      IF(number < 0)
07      {
08        hasNegative <- true
09      }
10    }
11  RETURN(hasNegative)
12 }
```
