# Setting the Context

This is the last lesson in the unit, which means at this point students have a pretty good idea how `ArrayLists` can be leveraged when developing programs.

To help set the stage, lets create a concept map for the following question:
* How do `ArrayLists` make it easier to work with data in our program?

You should:
1. Brainstorm all concepts that come to mind
2. Draw arrows to connect the concepts
3. Label the arrows with verbs or short descriptions to identify the relationships between concepts and ideas

<hr>

**Up next:** Your students have learned a lot about working with `String` and `ArrayList` objects in this unit! This lesson is all about how we can combine this knowledge with what they've learned so far this eyar to write algorithms to implement basic NLP techniques. Next, we will look at a few examples.
