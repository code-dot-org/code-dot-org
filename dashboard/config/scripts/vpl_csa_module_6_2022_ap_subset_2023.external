# The AP Subset for the String class

In your workshop, you reviewed the  <a href="https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/ap/pdf/ap-computer-science-a-java-quick-reference_0.pdf" target="blank">College Board’s Java Quick Reference</a>.  This is a document students will have access to on the AP Exam and includes the classes and methods they will be expected to know and use on the exam. 

It is important to note that these are not all the methods in the `String` class, but rather a subset.  These are the only `String` methods students will need to know and use on the exam.

Below is a screen shot of the College Board’s Java Quick Reference for the `String` class.  As you review this documentation:

1. Note any descriptions that surprise you or might surprise students.
2. Consider how students might use these methods in their Unit 6 project which you saw in your workshop.

**Up next:** You will engage in two “Investigate levels” from the curriculum that introduce the `substring()`, `indexOf()` and `compareTo()` methods in the `String` class.
