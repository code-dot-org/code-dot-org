The next 3 questions all refer to data collected in a hypothetical survey of high school seniors, and a student, Amara, who is working with this data.

The survey of high school seniors asked:

* What state do you live in?
* How likely are you to attend college in your home state? (on a scale of 1-5, 5 meaning "very likely")
* What do you plan to study?
 
  Amara does an initial computation on the data to make a summary table. A small segment is shown below.
