# Programming - Interactive Games and Animations: Lesson 15 - Functions

## Background

You've learned how to use a number of abstractions in the last several lessons that represent more complex code. This meant you learned to use a single block that represented more detailed code. Now it's time to learn how to create your own blocks by writing **functions**. You'll use functions to remove repetition in your code and break your draw loop into more logical sections. Using this code you'll build a simple coin collector game.
