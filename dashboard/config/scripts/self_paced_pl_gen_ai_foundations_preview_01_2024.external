# Introduction to Generative AI

## Lesson Highlight: Graphic Organizer

#### In Lesson 1, students are introduced to the  **Input, Storage, Processing, Output** (ISPO) framework to understand how generative AI works. In Lesson 1, students are provided with a graphic organizer which they add to throughout the unit.

#### Before you move on, check out this exemplar Graphic Organizer to help you understand the ISPO framework. This exemplar is available in the Lesson Plan.

#### **Question of the Day:** How can we begin to understand Generative AIâ€™s impact on how we live and work?

#### **Lesson Overview:**

#### This lesson introduces the learning goals focused on artificial intelligence (AI), transitioning into generative AI. It begins with a discussion on the impact of past technological innovations on society. Students then explore the concept of generative AI through the lens of someone familiar only with its hype, aiming to foster understanding and responsible engagement with AI technology. A key part of the lesson is the introduction of the Input, Storage, Processing, Output (ISPO) framework, essential for understanding generative AI's workings. The lesson concludes with students receiving a graphic organizer for the unit and sharing their anticipations about learning more on generative AI.

#### **Students will be able to:**
* #### Distinguish between different types of AI, including machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI.
* #### Evaluate the potential impact of generative AI on society and discuss its capabilities and limitations.
* #### Identify and explain the four key components that make up a computer system.
