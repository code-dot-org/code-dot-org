# Great job! You just debugged a program! 
## What is debugging?


####**Debugging** in computer science is about finding and fixing bugs, or errors, in code, much like being a computer detective. It's normal for code to have bugs on the first try, so don't worry. Remember, coding and debugging teach **persistence**, which means trying different solutions until you get it right.

#### **Bug** - Part of a program that does not work correctly.

#### **Debugging** - Finding and fixing problems in an algorithm or program.

#### **Persistence** - Not giving up.
#### *Persistence works best when you try things many different ways, many different times.*
