**Now that you have coded your poem, it's time to share it out!**

As you view your classmates' project think about a “glow”, a “grow”, and a “question” you can write for your partner:

- A “glow” is something they did well
- A “grow” is something they can change or improve
- A “question” is something you want to know more about
