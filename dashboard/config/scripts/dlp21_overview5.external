# Deeper Learning Program

## What are the requirements, due dates, and compensation?
All facilitators are required to respond to one set of reflection questions, or a module, per workshop as part of the Facilitator Development Program. Modules are due two weeks before each of your workshops but may be submitted before your due date. You will have multiple opportunities to resubmit your responses if they do not meet requirements.

**Publish dates for prompts**
- Module 2: September 8, 2021
- Module 3: October 18, 2021
- Module 4: November 19, 2021

Each completed module (all three prompts submitted and accepted) will be compensated $300.  Starting in October, a progress report is sent the third Wednesday of even months and the list for payments is sent to Finance on the first Wednesday of the odd months.  Depending on your financial institution, credit to your account can take up to two weeks to process. The program ends on April 30, 2022 and the final payment cycle is in May.

**Payment Cycle Dates**
1. Progress report: October 20 for payment on November 3
2. Progress report: December 15 for payment on January 5
3. Progress report: February 16 for payment on March 2
4. Progress report: April 20 for payment on May 4
