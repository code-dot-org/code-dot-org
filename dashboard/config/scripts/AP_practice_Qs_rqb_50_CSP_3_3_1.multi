Digital data can be compressed in order to reduce file size, and speed of transmission through a network. While some compression techniques are lossy, others preserve the original data in the compressed form. Compression techniques (lossy or lossless) can do the following, EXCEPT:

Learning Objective: **3.3.1** and Essential Knowledge statements: **3.3.1C, 3.3.1D, 3.3.1E**
<hr>
 (A) This option is incorrect. Multiple files can be compressed in a single zipped file, which than then be unzipped to retrieve the original files. This is lossless compression.


<hr>
 (B) This option is incorrect. Jpg is a valid result of a lossy type of compression technique

<hr>
 (C) This option is incorrect. A compressed zip file can be extracted to retrieve its original. This is lossless compression. 


<hr>
 (D) This option is correct. Compression techniques involve encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation. They can either preserve the original (lossless), or they can compress the original in a way that they permanently lose some of the original data (lossy)
