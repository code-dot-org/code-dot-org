When breaking a problem down you often encounter elements that you want to use repeatedly in your code. Sometimes it's appropriate to write a new function, other times it's appropriate to write a loop.  

There is no hard and fast rule as to which is better, but what do you think?  What kinds of circumstances would lead you to writing a function versus using a loop?

Answers will vary, but should include these concepts:
When breaking down a problem we use functions to group logical chunks of our solution. We break down problems into pieces but some pieces may need to be used multiple times.

Sometimes a function in our solution to a programming problem will need to be used multiple times in a row. In these instances, we should use a loop to repeatedly call that function.

Keeping functions at the center of our thinking, helps us because event-driven programming basically leads to a 'event->function' structure to most programs.
