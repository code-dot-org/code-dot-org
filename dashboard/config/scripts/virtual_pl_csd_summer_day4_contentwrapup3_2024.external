#### **This activity is optional.** If you'd like to continue learning about the CS Discoveries curriculum with an accountability buddy, consider adding your name to the "I’d like to learn more about…" slide in your cohort's slide deck. You and your buddy will need to establish how you will connect. This is a great way to stay in touch with the CS community outside of Code.org workshops.
