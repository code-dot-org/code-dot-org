**Explanation:** Using your Flippy Do, the first place value that fits into 20, going from left to right, is 16, so the 16s place becomes a 1. Next, 4 remains and so you put a 1 in the 4s place. (1 x 16) + (0 x 8) + (1 x 4) + (0 x 2) + (0 x 1) = 20

[Lesson 4 - Binary Numbers](https://curriculum.code.org/csp-20/unit1/4/) introduced the skill of converting between decimal and binary numbers.
