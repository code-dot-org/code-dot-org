[Lesson 2 - Building a Network](https://studio.code.org/s/csp2-2021/lessons/2) gave students opportunities to build networks with the consideration that some connections might be broken. [Lesson 4 - Routers and Redundancy](https://studio.code.org/s/csp2-2021/lessons/4) introduced students to the concept of fault-tolerant networks.

::: details [**Essential Knowledge Connected To This Question**]

* CSN-1.A.5: A path between two computing devices on a computer network (a sender or a receiver) is a sequence of directly-connected computing devices beginning at the sender and ending at the receiver

* CSN-1.E.4: If a particular device or connection on the Internet fails, subsequent data will be sent via a different route, if possible.
