### **Key Vocabulary**

* #### **Decode** - to change how information is represented so that it can be read by a person.
* #### **Encode** - to change how information is represented so that it can be read by a computer.

#### **Data** is information that has been collected about the world. Data can be any type of information, not just numbers. In Chapter 1 of the Data and Society unit, students will learn the different representation systems that computers use to represent information. 

## Creating a Data Representation System

#### Students begin by creating their own system for representing information in <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/csd5-2023/lessons/2" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lesson 2: Patterns and Representation</a>. This prompts students to explore for themselves the qualities of good systems for representing information. They should find through creating and testing their systems that:

* #### There are typically many possible systems for representing information.
* #### People must agree on a common set of rules for a system to work.

#### The features of the systems students create in this lesson serve as a reference point in future lessons when students explore the representation systems actually used in computers.

## Example Data Representation System

#### Below is an example of a data representation system. In Lesson 2, students use a set of animal cards (Monkey, Hippo, Rabbit, Giraffe, Pig, and Elephant) to build their own alphabet.
