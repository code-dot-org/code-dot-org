# Unit 6 Lessons > Days 10-13

## Concepts Covered

Build robots that can execute the functions programmed through the Robot Educator Software.

## Lesson Overview

In this lesson the students will be working in groups of 3-4 in the Mindstorms Robot Educator Software to follow the tutorials that will guide them in first using the building blocks of the common palette and then the complete palette.  It will be most helpful for you as a teacher to go through the tutorials yourself before you have the students try it. Review with students the assessment model used in the tutorials.
