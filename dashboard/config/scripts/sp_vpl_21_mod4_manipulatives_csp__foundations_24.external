# Building a shared mental model using manipulatives

#### In Module 3, you learned about Explore, Investigate, Practice, and Make (EIPM) sequences and how they are used in programming units to set students up for success. Now, let's zoom in on the role of the **Explore** lessons as foundational experiences that build a shared mental model for students.

## What is a shared mental model?

#### In the Code.org curriculum, a **shared mental model** is a mental model of a programming concept that is held in common by your students. We build these shared mental models through collaborative lesson activities that allow students to touch, move, and demonstrate relationships between objects that represent programming concepts.

#### For example, students can use materials as simple as plastic bags and sticky notes to demonstrate how variables can store information. Rather than diving in to assigning values to variables in a coding environment, students can see how information written on sticky notes can be "held" by a plastic baggie. This creates a foundation for their understanding of variables.

## Why use manipulatives to build a shared mental model?

#### Here are just a few reasons why we've included shared mental models in the curriculum:
##
* ##### **Mental models can build over time**. Explore lessons often use the same materials to demonstrate coding concepts. By reusing these manipulatives, students can revisit what they've already learn to evolve their understanding of computer science throughout the year.

* ##### **Memorable experiences are one way we build CS understanding with equity in mind.** We want to give students memorable experiences in programming units. One way we do this is through using mental models that provide all students, regardless of prior programming experience, a solid foundation in a concept.

* ##### **Having a shared mental model means you have a tool in your teaching toolbox.** After every student has a shared mental model they can talk to one another with this in mind. When working with students, you can reference the mental model to help clear up misconceptions.
