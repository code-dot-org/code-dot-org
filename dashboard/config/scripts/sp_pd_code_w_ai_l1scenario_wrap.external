# Wrapping up lesson one

#### Students do not need to have firm ideas or decisions on the "right" way to supportively work with AI in these scenarios - that's what they will explore in the following lessons. The goal of the scenarios is to give students the opportunity to begin thinking about supportive vs non-supportive ways to use AI that will help, rather than hinder their education.

## Supportive and non-supportive 

#### The scenario discussions aim to help students distinguish the difference between "supportive" and "non-supportive". Help guide your students to understand that "supportive" includes ways to use AI to assist in a task while they still maintain control and make decisions on the final product, while "non-supportive" usually means using AI in a way that leaves all the decisions up to the AI.

## Creating value statements

#### The lesson progresses to an activity prompting ethical considerations with working with AI and wraps up with the students creating a value statement about how they think AI can and should be used to support them when programming and their reasons why.
