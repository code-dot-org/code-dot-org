#### Lessons 2 through 4 in the Customizing Large Language Models unit help students develop an understanding of system prompting. Students go through the **Explore-Practice-Synthesis** model of learning.

## Lesson 2: Exploration
#### This lesson introduces the **system prompt** and guides students through how it impacts a chatbot's behavior. Students predict, discuss, and investigate the effects of system prompts, learning how prompt design can direct and limit chatbot interactions. They practice crafting prompts to elicit specific responses and incorporate personal experiences to observe the effects.

## Lesson 3: Practice
#### This lesson builds fluency in designing and applying system prompts, expanding on knowledge from the previous lesson. Students learn to craft prompts that guide the **content, style, and appropriateness** of AI response's for different audiences and situations. They practice these skills through scenarios simulating real-life use cases and user stories, emphasizing practical problem-solving.

## Lesson 4: Synthesis
#### This lesson expands on the prompting techniques learned previously, inviting students to reflect on their skill growth. They explore advanced techniques: **chain of reasoning** for precise responses and providing examples to enhance accuracy. After practicing these skills, students revisit and refine earlier activities using their accumulated knowledge.

You can assure students that there is no trick, just a set of strategies that tend to work more often than others but are still unreliable.

## Up Next!
#### You’ll learn about system prompts yourself before you try out writing your own in some levels from the curriculum.
