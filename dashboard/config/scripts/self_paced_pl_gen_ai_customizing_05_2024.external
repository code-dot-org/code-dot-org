#### Lessons 2 through 4 in the Customizing Large Language Models unit help students develop an understanding of system prompting. Students go through the **Explore-Practice-Synthesis** model of learning.

## Exploration
#### Students are introduced to **system prompt** and explore how it impacts a chatbot's behavior. Students predict, discuss, and investigate the effects of system prompts, learning how prompt design can direct and limit chatbot interactions.

## Practice
#### Students build fluency in designing and applying system prompts. They learn to craft prompts that guide the **content, style, and appropriateness** of AI response's for different audiences and situations.

## Synthesis
#### Students learn advanced techniques including **chain of reasoning**  building chatbots that provide precise responses and **giving examples** to enhance accuracy.

You can assure students that there is no trick, just a set of strategies that tend to work more often than others but are still unreliable.
