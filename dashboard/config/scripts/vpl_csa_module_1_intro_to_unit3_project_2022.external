# Reviewing the Unit 3 Project

*Goal: To understand the options students have when starting the Unit 3 project.*

Let’s get started by going into more depth in the Unit 3 Project.  In the Unit 3 project, students use data to help a user solve a problem or get more information.  

Below are the 5 different “User Stories” students can choose from.

Students start with a user story as a starting point for their project.  With this user story in mind, students will develop their own computer program that will help the user featured in the user story.  

In order to provide students with more options, students are also able to use other datasets that they are interested in too.  The last tile in the image above provides a structure for students to write their own user story and identify a data set that can help that user.  It is recommended that students select a data set first and then cerate a User Story in the interest of time.

**Up next:** We will learn more about user stories in software engineering.
