## Getting Started > Welcome!


Congratulations on completing your Exploring Computer Science professional development experience this summer. We hope your back-to-school transition has been an easy one, and that you’re eager to get started applying your learning of ECS in your classes.

<br><br>
>As you are aware, throughout the 2015-16 school year, you will participate in on-going academic year support. This support will be provided to you through a blended model:

>- Four face-to-face professional development sessions throughout the school year, in your region. These sessions are held on specific dates in your region. [You can find the dates for your region’s trainings here](https://code.org/educate/pd/15-16).
>- Three self-paced online PD courses, which provide real-time support to you as you deliver content from the ECS Version 5 curriculum.
