# Build Your Own Choose Your Own Adventure

#### Now you know all the skills you need to build you own Choose Your Own Adventure. A good idea is to do just a quick sketch of the story you want to tell. Each rectangle is a screen you'll need to make. You'll need buttons to get between each screen. Finally you'll need to create `onEvent()` blocks for button that use `setScreen()` to change the screens. Play sounds, add text, change colors, or edit formatting however you want to make the story more interesting and engaging.
