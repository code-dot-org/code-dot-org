### Persistence of Vision

Turn of the main lights, turn on a flashlight, and wave it around. See the streaky trails that it leaves behind? You're eyes can't quite keep up with the motion of the light and they blend the moving light into a constant streak. The same basic principle is what makes movies look like smooth motion, the quickly changing images are blended into smooth motion by your brain.

With the same 8 LEDs that you've been programming you too can take advantage of this optical illusion, called persistence of vision. If you program your LEDs to blink in the right way, and move them at the right speed, you can make shapes, images, and even words appear. Try loading this code onto your board, turn out the lights, and wave your LEDs in the air. Experiment with different speeds and directions of waving to see if you can make the letters show up.
