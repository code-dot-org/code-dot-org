There are many resources and tools you can choose from to teach CSA.  Here are Code.org, we:

* **Are free and open:** We make our curriculum, videos, and tools free and open for anyone to adopt. 
* **Provide extensive teacher resources:** The CSA curriculum includes daily lesson plans along with integrated discussion goals, teaching tips, and assessment opportunities. Our lesson plans come with detailed pacing instructions, short and engaging videos, activity guides, exemplar projects, sample marked rubrics, and more! Teachers are also able to create and manage classroom sections, check student progress, administer assessments, and integrate with Google Classroom, all from a Teacher Dashboard! (Sign in required.)
* **Are AP endorsed:** Code.org is recognized by the College Board as an endorsed provider of curriculum and professional development for AP® Computer Science A (AP CSA). This endorsement affirms that all components of Code.org CSA’s offerings are aligned to the AP Curriculum Framework standards, the AP CSA assessment, and the AP framework for professional development. Using an endorsed provider affords schools access to resources including an AP CSA syllabus pre-approved by the College Board’s AP Course Audit, and officially-recognized professional development that prepares teachers to teach AP CSA.
