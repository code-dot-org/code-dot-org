<p><strong>Welcome to Code.org&#39;s K-5 Intro to Computer Science Online Professional Development Course.</strong> </p>

<p>Code.org&#39;s professional development program prepares you to integrate computer science into your classroom and supports your growth as a teacher. This online course may be sufficient for some teachers to start using our materials in their classrooms, but if you are looking for further professional development, please see our workshops hosted in the United States for K-5 Educators. These are high-quality workshops taught by seasoned computer science educators. </p>

<p><a href="http://code.org/professional-development-workshops">Sign up for a workshop here</a>.</p>

<p>During this online course, you&#39;ll watch videos, read articles, do online activities, and discuss with other teachers about the basics of computer science and how to use Code.org&#39;s online learning system. We want to let you explore writing computer programs on your own so that you can experience the excitement of teaching computer science.</p>

<p>During the PD program and anytime afterward, Code.org and our community of engaged educators will always be around for support at <a href="http://support.code.org">http://support.code.org</a>.</p>
