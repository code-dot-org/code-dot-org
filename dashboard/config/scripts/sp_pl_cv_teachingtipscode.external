# Teaching Strategies in Computer Vision

#### This unit offers many ways to differentiate and customize learning in your class. Take time to look at the resources provided. 

## Prior knowledge  
- #### Consider your students' prior knowledge of AI and computer vision and decide if you want to use  some of Code.orgâ€™s <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/how-ai-works-2023?section_id=5174974&viewAs=Instructor" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How AI Works</a> lessons or specifically, the <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/how-ai-works-2023/lessons/2" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Computer Vision Lesson</a> if you feel your students would benefit from this content first. It might be helpful to provide context about what computer vision is and how it works before diving into this unit.

- #### Some lessons use software like **Google Sheets** and **Google Forms**. Consider your students experience with these tools and decide if you will need to take extra time to support these lessons. 

## Differentiation 
#### Some of the lessons offer choice activities and extension options to help you customize the lesson to your needs. Carefully read over these options to decide how you want your class to proceed. 

## Teaching tips
#### Notice the orange boxes in the teaching guides. These teaching tips provide useful suggestions for managing your class during the different activities.

## Materials
#### Decide how you want to share materials with your students. In some instances, it may benefit to share the handouts digitally, in others,  you may prefer to make copies. 

## External Websites 
#### Check if the lessons involve external websites and verify whether they are blocked by your school in advance. If they are blocked, either find alternative sites or follow your school's procedure to unblock the websites.
