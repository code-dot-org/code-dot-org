As you wrap up, remember that Code.org will continue to be available as you proceed through the steps necessary to keep your classroom going.

For simple questions, be sure to check <a href="https://support.code.org" target="_new">support.code.org</a> for answers.  

For more unique questions, post a message in the <a href="http://forum.code.org/c/cs-in-science" target="_new">forums</a> or pose it on <a href="https://twitter.com/teachcodeorg" target="_new">Twitter with the @teachCodeorg handle</a>. Both of these methods reach beyond your local community to solicit help from others who may have already implemented these lessons.

For all other issues, please contact us at <a href="mailto:pd@code.org">pd@code.org</a> and someone from our small team will get back to you as soon as we are able.
