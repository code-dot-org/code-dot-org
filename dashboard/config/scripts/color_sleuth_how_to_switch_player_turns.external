# Whose turn is it?
<div style="width: 400px; margin: auto">

<p style="text-align: center"> ALEXIS </p>

<p>Wow, it's really beginning to feel like a game!</p>

<p style="text-align: center"> MICHAEL </p>

<p>I know. So now let's think about scoring.</p>

<p>It's not so simple because what we want is for the players to take turns.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"> ALEXIS </p>

<p>Right, to update the score we need to know which player clicked a button.  That means we need a way to indicate whose turn it is, and then update things based on that.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"> MICHAEL </p>

<p>I think we can just make another global variable to keep track.  We can just store a number: <code>1</code> for player 1 and <code>2</code> for player 2. Then every time a button is clicked, we make a new game board, and we can also switch the player from 1 to 2, or 2 to 1.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"> ALEXIS </p>

<p>Okay, so there are actually two major things we need to do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Alternate turns between player1 and player2 each time a button is clicked</li>

<li>Update player1's score if it was her turn or player2's score if hers.</li>
</ol>

<p style="text-align: center"> MICHAEL </p>

<p>Probably yeah. Also, I wanted to indicate on the screen whose turn it is by showing and hiding a simple gray box behind the player's score, like this:</p>

<div style="width: 400px; margin: auto">

<p>So, part of alternating turns is to update the screen to show whose turn it is.  What should we do first?</p>

<p style="text-align: center"> ALEXIS </p>

<p>Well, I think we should start by getting the alternating player action working first. Because we can't really test whether we're updating the correct player's score unless we have it. </p>

<p style="text-align: center"> MICHAEL </p>

<p>Mhm.  Good thinking. So let's start with get alternating turns working. </p>

<p style="text-align: center"> ALEXIS  </p>

<p>It seems like we're going to need a small if statement that says something like "if it's player1's turn right now, then make it player2's turn, otherwise (it must be player2's turn so) make it player1's turn."</p>

<p style="text-align: center"> MICHAEL </p>

<p>Maybe we should put the code into another function that handles just the switching of the player and updating the screen. Call it something like <code>switchPlayer()</code>.  </p>

<p style="text-align: center"> ALEXIS </p>

<p>I think I follow. let's make sure we're both thinking the same thing.  Let me add to the pseudocode here...</p>

<div style="width: 400px; margin: auto">

<p style="text-align: center"> MICHAEL </p>

<p>I like it.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"> ALEXIS </p>

<p>Okay, let's add it with just console.log statements to verify for now.  We'll update the UI once we know we have the variable changing correctly.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"> MICHAEL </p>

<p>Sounds good.  Let's do it.</p>
