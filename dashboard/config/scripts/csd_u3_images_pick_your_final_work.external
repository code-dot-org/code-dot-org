# Ending Project

We've played with a bunch of different types of projects over the course of this lesson. You've probably got some cool ideas of ways to make them even better. 

# Do This
Pick one project from the list and continue to work on it. If you finish that project you can come back here and pick a new one.  The next 5 levels are just places for you to work on the five different options.
