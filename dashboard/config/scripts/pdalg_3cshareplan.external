# Planning For the Future > What's your plan?

Now that you've seen some of the options available, how do you plan to continue growing as a CS teacher next year? For example, will you:

* Split CS in A over 7th and 8th grade, teaching Course A in 7th and Course B in 8th?
* Introduce Bootstrap I to students who took CS in Algebra this year?
* Talk to your administrator about setting up a standalone CS elective?
