Consider the following three classes.

```
public class Shape {
   public void printShape() {
      System.out.print("Shape ");
   }
}

public class Square extends Shape {
   public void printShape() {
      System.out.print("Square ");
   }
}

public class Triangle extends Shape {
   public void printShape() {
      System.out.print("Triangle ");
   }
}
```

What is printed as a result of executing the following code segment?

```
Shape[] shapes = {new Square(), new Triangle(), new Shape(), new Square()};
for (int i = 0; i < shapes.length; i++) {
   shapes[i].printShape();
}
```
