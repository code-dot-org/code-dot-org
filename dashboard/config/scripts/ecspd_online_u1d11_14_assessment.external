## Data, Modeling, and Design

In Unit 1 Day 11-14, students investigate how computers can be used for data representation, modeling, and design.

#### Student Activity

Many design tools take weeks to learn (such as Autodesk Maya, below). The activity for this lesson gives students access to simpler design tools to use. Take a few minutes and use the tools for this lesson to design your own image.

#### <strong>Activity:</strong> 

Choose one of the culturally situated design tools from this lesson, follow the tutorial, and create a design (links below). Then, edit it with Photoshop if possible. If you don't have access to Photoshop, try using <a href="http://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">Blender</a>, a free 3D creation suite.

When you are finished, upload your image to the forum at the end of this stage.
