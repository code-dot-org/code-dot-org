# Lesson Plans

## Where do I find lesson plans?
You can see all the lesson plans for all of the CS Discoveries courses <a href="https://curriculum.code.org" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">curriculum.code.org</a>. For easy future access, it is recommended that you bookmark this site in your preferred web browser.

## How are lesson plans structured?

Every lesson plan has a common structure designed to make it easy to find what you need. As you plan for a lesson, we recommend starting with the overview, then reviewing the core activity to get a deeper sense of what will happen in the lesson and how long it might take.
