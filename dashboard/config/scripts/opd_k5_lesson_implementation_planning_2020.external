# Lesson Implementation Planning Guides

The goal of these questions is to help you think about and make a detailed plan for how you might teach lessons in a way that leverages best teaching practices and supports students. Think about these questions as you continue to learn basic coding concepts and teaching practices throughout this online professional development course.
