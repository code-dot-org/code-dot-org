Consider the following code segment.

```
1  int[][] numList = { {8, 9, 3, 5, 4}, {7, 4, 6, 8, 0}, {3, 6, 9, 2, 5} };
2  for (int col = 0; col <= numList[0].length; col++) {
3    for (int row = 0; row < numList.length; row++) {
4      System.out.println(numList[row][col]);
5    }
6  }
```

Which of the following is the reason why an exception is thrown when the code is executed?

In the code segment, the outer `for` loop (Line 2) iterates over the columns with the condition `col <= numList[0].length`. However, since array indices start from `0`, the correct condition should be `col < numList[0].length`.

The current condition in the code causes the loop to iterate one time more than the number of columns, leading to an out of range index when trying to access the elements of the array in Line 4. This results in an exception being thrown.
