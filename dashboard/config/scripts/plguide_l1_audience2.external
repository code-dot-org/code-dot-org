# Facilitated and Non-facilitated Audiences 

#### Self-paced learning modules are used by teachers to independently learn content however, it is important to be aware that the content is also being used in the facilitator led **Custom Workshops** program. 

#### Keep in mind different features in the modules appeal to various learning environments. 

## Independent Learners

* #### **Clear Communication and Instructions:** Ensure that instructions are clear and straightforward to avoid technical difficulties from hampering the learning experience.
* #### **Engaging Content:** Use a mix of multimedia like videos, graphics, and interactive levels. 
* #### **Check for Understanding:** Add assessment levels throughout the module for teachers to validate their learning.
* #### **Independent Reflection**: Provide reflection experiences that bridge to the classroom, such as planning guide documents that learners can refer to while teaching. Keep open-ended reflections to a minimum as they are not checked by a facilitator in self-paced courses and require the learner to go back to the web page to review their answer.

## Facilitated Learners 
* #### **Interactive Activities:** Be sure to use plenty of hands-on coding levels to ensure active engagement.
* #### **Opportunities for Discussion:** In facilitated experiences, use open-ended reflection levels to foster discussion. These levels are actively checked by facilitators.
