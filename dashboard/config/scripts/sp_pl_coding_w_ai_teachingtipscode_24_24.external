#### This unit offers many ways to differentiate and customize learning in your class. Take time to look at the resources provided. 

## Prior knowledge  
#### Consider your students' prior knowledge of Chatbots and LLMs and decide if you want to use  some of Code.orgâ€™s <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/how-ai-works-2023?section_id=5174974&viewAs=Instructor" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How AI Works</a> lessons or specifically, the <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/how-ai-works-2023/lessons/4" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chatbots and Large Language Models Lesson</a> if you feel your students would benefit from this content first. It might be helpful to provide context about what an LLM is and how it works before diving into using them.

#### Additional resources to enhance background knowledge are provided in the preparation section of the lesson plan.

## Differentiation 
#### Several of the lessons offer choice activities and extension options to help you customize the lesson to your needs. Carefully read over these options to decide how you want your class to proceed.
