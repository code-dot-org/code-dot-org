## Next Steps

#### Ensure that each of the following things are true for your teaching group:

1. Each teacher in your group has a role in delivering your TLO lesson.
2. Your group has contingency plans for if the lesson goes longer or shorter than planned.
3. You have communicated (or will shortly communicate) with your producer about the size and timing of breakout rooms for your TLO lesson.
