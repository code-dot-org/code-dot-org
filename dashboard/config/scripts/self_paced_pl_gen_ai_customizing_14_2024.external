#### Lessons 16 through 18 in the Customizing Large Language Models unit help students develop an understanding of **retrieval**. Students go through the Explore-Practice-Synthesis model of learning.

## Lesson 16: Exploration
#### This lesson introduces the concept of **retrieval** and guides students through how it impacts a chatbot's behavior. Students predict, discuss, and investigate the effects of retrieval, learning how adding specific information to a chatbotâ€™s knowledge base can improve accuracy and relevance. They practice adding retrieval information to elicit specific responses and observe the effects.

## Lesson 17: Practice
#### This lesson builds fluency in designing and applying retrieval statements, expanding on knowledge from the previous lesson. Through examples and guided practice, students learn how retrieval provides **current, specialized, and accurate information**, reducing AI hallucinations. They practice these skills through scenarios simulating real-life use cases, emphasizing the use of trusted data sources.

## Lesson 18: Synthesis
#### This lesson focuses on applying retrieval and system prompting to complex user scenarios. Students brainstorm and plan strategies to achieve user goals, explore methods for **testing and evaluating chatbots**, and design chatbots tailored to each scenario, deciding between system prompts or retrieval. The lesson concludes with a reflection on the appropriate use of these techniques and revisiting previous tasks to enhance earlier work.

## Up Next!
#### Dive into current, specialized, and accurate information and practice your new skills in chatbot lab.
