This level appears at the end of units 5-10. **Please have your students complete this survey after the last unit they complete before starting the Create Performance Task!!!**

* The results are vital for us (code.org) to sustain our courses and make improvements.
* We hope that some of the student responses will help you plan which topics you choose to review with your students.
* There will be a teacher survey as well where you can provide your own input. You will be notified via email about the teacher survey.

**To view results** -- the post-course survey is a little different. The survey which lives in its own unit of the course, and this page simply links to it.

* To view anonymized results of the survey in your teacher dashboard, you need to (1) view survey/assessments, and then (2) select the post-course survey unit as the unit you want view.
