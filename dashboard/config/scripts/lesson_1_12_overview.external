Unplugged | Group Problem Solving | Internet Simulator | Research

The core idea of this lesson occurs in the unplugged activity that kicks off the lesson, in which students try to keep track of IP addresses that had been randomly assigned to each student in the class, while at the same time the teacher occasionally changes studentsâ€™ addresses. This leads to identifying the need for an authoritative system for name-to-address mappings, known as the Domain Name System or DNS.
