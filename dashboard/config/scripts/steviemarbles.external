Jorge comes over and points out that Stevie looks “frustrated”  
Stevie argues that she’s not frustrated, she’s mad at this project because it’s stupid  
Jorge teaches tells that frustration can be hard to recognize, because it likes to disguise itself as sadness or anger, but if you find yourself mad at your teacher, your project, or even yourself, chances are that you’re feeling frustrated  
Jorge teaches Stevie that frustration is a sign that you’re learning something and that you shouldn’t be afraid of frustration or try to avoid it, you just need to learn to recognize it and push through it, then you will learn something  
Princess Pria comes around and shares her secret for persistence, even in the face of frustration.
