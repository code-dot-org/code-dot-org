# Unit 3: Lesson 23 - Loops and Simulations

## Background

We can often develop intuitions for patterns by performing real-life experiments at a small scale, but verifying our intuitions with larger experiments can prove prohibitively time-consuming, costly, or even dangerous. If we can develop a model or simulation of the phenomenon we wish to investigate, we can confirm our hypotheses much more quickly without the risks or costs associated with a real-life experiment.

## Vocabulary

**Simulation:** a program which replicates key features of a phenomenon in order to assist investigations of its behavior without the associated cost, time, or danger of running an experiment in real life.

## Lesson

* Calculate statistics from a coin flipping experiment.
* Create a simulation to repeat this experiment for much larger inputs.
* Create updated hypotheses based on the results of simulations.
