# Overview

In this lesson covers common issues that arise when designing web pages in HTML. The class will correct errors in a sequence of increasingly complex web pages found on Code Studio and learn the importance of comments, whitespace, and indentation as tools for making web pages easier to read.
## Vocabulary

* **Bug** - Part of a program that does not work correctly.
* **Comment** - A comment is a programmer-readable note in the source code of a computer program.
* **Debugging** - Finding and fixing problems in your algorithm or program.
* **Indentation** - The placement of text farther to the right, or left, to separate it from surrounding text which helps to convey the program's structure.
* **Whitespace** - Whitespace refers to any character that shows up as a blank space on the screen, such as a space, a tab, or a new line. Whitespace helps separate different parts of the document to make it easier to read.

## Introduced Code
