## Unit 1 Day 5-7: Searching and Web 2.0

Since this lesson was covered by a teaching group during your in-person PD, the resources for this stage of the online PD will focus on extending the lesson to explore further into the topics.

Before you start, however, make sure you have taken note that some of the links in the ECS curriculum are no longer active. You will have space in the forum to share other resources that might work well.
