## Unit 4: Lesson 05 - Making Data Visualizations

# Background

Good visualizations can help people make sense of data sets that are too large to interpret by looking at the raw data. Now that youâ€™ve had the chance to see and evaluate some data visualizations, you will learn to use a spreadsheet tool to make visualizations of your own.

# Lesson

* Make a scatter chart.
* Make a line chart.
* Make a bar chart.
* Make your own chart.
