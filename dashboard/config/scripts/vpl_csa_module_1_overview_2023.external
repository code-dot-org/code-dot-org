# Module 1: CSA Virtual Professional Learning

(Estimated time: ~5 minutes)

## Module 1 Overview

Welcome to your first module of asynchronous work for CSA! We have selected a set of experiences for you to engage in that connect to what you did in the corresponding synchronous facilitator-led call.  These experiences will also help you understand the content and curriculum as you prepare to teach your own students. Combined, these asynchronous tasks should take about 60 minutes to complete, but you can start and stop at your own pace.

This module builds on the work you did during your summer workshop to better understand the Unit 3 project and the "Software Engineering for All" theme of Code.org's CSA Curriculum. 

**During this asynchronous work you will:**

* Learn about software engineering and user stories in Unit 3
* Develop your own user story for the Unit 3 project
* Determine if the existing Unit 3 project rubric meets your needs
* Check in with your pacing for the course


**After this asynchronous work you will:**

* Be prepared to do the Unit 3 project with your students
* Understand how your pacing for the year might impact decisions you make for your class. 

**Let's get started!**
