##### Check out what teachers are saying about teaching game design: 
* ##### "The most vital aspect was the discussion at the end. Students really embraced the process of verbalizing the 'glows and grows,' enhancing their learning experience through reflective conversation."
* ##### "It was just pure fun. Everyone loves playing games, but learning how to design them? That's something special. This was how I introduced game design to both 4th and 5th graders, and they were instantly engaged and excited."
* ##### "I noted particular enthusiasm from students who previously didn't feel confident with coding, including gifted students who might not typically enjoy it. They became very excited when they managed to grasp new concepts and even more so when they could help a classmate understand a problem."
