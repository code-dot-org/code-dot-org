# Getting Started

## Preview curriculum resources

Curriculum resources are included in all lesson plans for both you and your students.  All courses do not have the same curriculum resources as some handouts may not be age appriopriate for younger students.  For example, Course A is designed for kindergarten and does not include a student rubric, but does include a project guide.  

**Note:** The curriculum resources below, open in a new window.  Be sure to return to this page to continue with the course.
