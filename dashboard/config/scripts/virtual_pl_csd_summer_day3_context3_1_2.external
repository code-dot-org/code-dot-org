#### CSP Unit 3 is called Intro to App Design and it includes 8 lessons. Throughout the unit, students learn how to make simple apps and eventually create a working app with a partner. It serves as a bridge from the non-programming Units 1 and 2 to the more formal programming Units 4 and beyond. In the first lesson, students explore and investigate what makes an app an app.
