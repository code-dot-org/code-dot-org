## Lesson 6: Pixels and QR Codes

#### In this lesson, students explore how images are represented on screens using pixels and color values (RGB) and how QR codes use these principles to **encode data**. 

#### Students engage in activities that illustrate the conversion of binary data into visual patterns and explore decoding mechanisms.

#### By the end of the lesson, students should be able to explain the information stored within a pixel and apply their knowledge to encode and decode QR codes.

#### This lesson focuses on **developing algorithms** that help computers identify and outline distinct boundaries within images. 

#### Students engage in activities that involve writing and optimizing their own **edge detection algorithms** and discussing their efficiency and practical applications.

#### By the end of this lesson, students should understand the technical aspects and importance of edge detection in various computer vision tasks.
