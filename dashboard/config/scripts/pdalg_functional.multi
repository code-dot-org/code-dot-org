The language that we'll be using in this course is called a Functional programming language, which is a type of language that follows a set of rules that aligns very well with the rules of Algebra. Some of the defining characteristics of this language are:

- Variables are immutable (once a value has been defined, it cannot be changed)
- Functions do not have side effects (given the same inputs, a function will run the same way every time, because it can't be impacted by outside elements)
- Every function maps its inputs (domain) to its output (range)
