## Take it Further
#### Revamp a lesson plan of your choice to include either teaching about AI or teaching with AI. You can rewrite the whole lesson plan or just modify an existing activity. Below are some examples:
* #### **Chats with AI**: Instead of a group discussion or “turn and talk” activity have students explain their understanding of a topic to an AI.
* #### **AI Brainstorming**: At the start of an essay or open-ended project have students brainstorm their ideas with an AI.
* #### **AI Tutor Demo**: Give a lesson or demonstration on how students can use an LLM to help them develop their own understanding of a topic instead of just as a way to get answers. 

#### Try out your new lesson with students and don’t forget to reflect on how it went afterwards.
