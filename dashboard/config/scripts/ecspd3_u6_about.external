# Getting Started > About this Online PD
 
This online professional development is designed to support you in delivering content from Unit 6 of the ECS Version 5 curriculum. The best way we can help you prepare for Unit 6 is to provide space and time to get into the lessons, to see how they tie together, and to consider how you will use the materials provided in the lessons when you teach these concepts.

## Pre-requisites

For success in this online PD, we assume that you have participated in a five-day face-to-face ECS workshop this summer, and the on-going support workshops during the fall. The fourth Saturday workshop during the school year is dedicated to planning and experiencing lessons from Unit 6. In this online PD, we're going to spend time looking over those lessons that weren't explored during the workshop and consider the resources and materials that will be helpful in planning and delivering Unit 6. 
 
## Course Duration

Completing this online PD should take about 2 hours, depending on your prior knowledge and how deeply you want to dive into the resources provided. Remember, the goal here is to help you prepare to teach Unit 6, so we recommend you complete it before you start teaching that unit. 
 
## Completion

You will be marked as having completed this online module once you have earned a “green dot” for each level in this online PD. This means that you are required to click the orange “Continue” button at the bottom of each level. You can check your progress at any time by clicking the “more” arrow at the top of the screen.
