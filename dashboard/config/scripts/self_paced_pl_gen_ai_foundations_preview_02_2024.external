#### **Question of the Day:** How does a computer recognize words used in language?

#### **Lesson Overview:**

#### In this lesson, students explore the process of recognizing and categorizing words, comparing it to how AI systems achieve similar tasks. Through discussion and activities, they consider the data sources an AI system requires to build a task-specific vocabulary, leading to the understanding that language models necessitate vast data amounts, like the entire internet. The lesson concludes with students updating a graphic organizer to reflect the Input step of generative AI.

#### **Students will be able to:**
* #### Explain how a language model uses data to recognize words as input
* #### Identify potential data sources relevant to a task being performed by a language model

#### **Question of the Day:** How do our choices about input data influence a large language model?

#### **Lesson Overview:**

#### This lesson formally introduces the concept of bias, where certain information is favored over others. Students experience how bias can implicitly and unintentionally creep into large-language models by participating in an activity where they are asked to source articles and information for a RecipeBot. Once they've used search engine results to generate their training data, they analyze patterns in the data that the class found as a collection, noticing unintended biases such as certain cuisines being unintentionally excluded or all the articles falling within a certain narrow date range. After acknowledging how bias can appear, students analyze several scenarios and discuss how bias could appear in the training data of each one.

#### **Students will be able to:**
* #### Describe patterns in collections of data sources that contribute to bias
