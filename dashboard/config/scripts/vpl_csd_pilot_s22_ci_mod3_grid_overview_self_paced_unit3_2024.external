# Plotting Shapes

#### One of the first skills students learn is how to plot shapes on the Game Lab **coordinate grid**. Students will be introduced to the coordinate grid in an activity where they will take turns instructing a partner how to draw a hidden image on a coordinate grid.

## Key Concepts

#### Students may have limited experience with using a coordinate grid or may struggle with the "flipped" y-axis in Game Lab. It is important that students understand the following before beginning to program in Game Lab.

* #### The origin of the grid, **(0,0)**, lies at the **top left-hand corner**. 
* #### Every point on the plane has positive coordinates. 
* #### The x-coordinate indicates **how far the shape is from the left of the grid**.
* #### The y-coordinate indicates **how far the shape is from the top of the grid**. 
* #### Order matters when plotting shapes on the grid, as they are drawn in the order that they are programmed. The first shape plotted on the grid will appear behind a shape plotted on the same coordinates of the grid.

#### **Note**: In Game Lab, students can choose to hide or show the grid using the "show grid" checkbox.


## ‚ùì Why is the Game Lab grid "flipped"?

#### Students might notice that the Game Lab grid is different from grid systems they may have seen in math class. **Computer screens come in all different shapes and sizes**, as does the content we show on them. We need to agree on **one point where all the content can grow from**. Since we read starting at the top left corner, the grid on a computer screen starts at the top left corner as well. There's also the benefit of **not having to use any negative numbers**.

### **Up Next:** Let's start practicing!
