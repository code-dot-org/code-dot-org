## Unit 1: Lesson 12 - Bytes and File Sizes
# Background

Early computers stored and ran 8-bit instructions and most relied on representing and exchanging messages encoded in ASCII text. The 8-bit chunk, or “byte” became a very common chunk-size or unit of data for representing information. It became the fundamental unit with which we measure the “size” of data on computers (kilobyte, megabyte, gigabyte, terabyte, etc). 

# Lesson

* Understand the relationships between bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes
* Find the size of computer files on your computer
