# The Internet - Web Development: Lesson 15 - Intellectual Property

## Background

Starting with an exploration of the song “Happy Birthday”, and its history of copyright protection despite being a common American cultural staple, the class will explore the purpose and role of copyright for both creators and users of creative content. After a brief discussion about the purpose of copyright, we move on to an activity exploring the various Creative Commons licences as a solution to the difficulty in dealing with copywrite.
