# The Internet - Web Development: Lesson 11 - Peer Review

## Background

Students have been continuously working on the same project for many weeks. In this lesson students take a step back from implementing their own website and look at peers websites. Through peer review students will get to share feedback on each others sites as well as hopefully get some new ideas for their own website.
