# Getting Started

Here are teacher tools, curriculum resources, and support to help you start teaching Computer Science Fundamentals.

## Step 1:  Create a teacher account

Visit the <a href="https://code.org" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code.org main website</a> to sign up for an account, if you don't already have one.  

**Note:**  You and your students do not need an account to work on Computer Science Fundamentals courses.  However, having an account allows you to see your students work and for student work to be saved.

## Step 2:  Use the teacher dashboard

The teacher dashboard contains tools for checking on and evaluating student work, as well as managing students in a classroom section. The image below is an example of the teacher dashboard with a class section filled with students.

## Step 3:  Access curriculum resources

### Examples of curriculum resources

Curriculum resources are included in all lesson plans for both you and your students.  All courses do not have the same curriculum resources as some handouts may not be age appriopriate for younger students.  For example, Course A is designed for kindergarten and does not include a student rubric, but does include a project guide.
