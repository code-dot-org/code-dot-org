#### This lesson is a prerequisite for teaching the coding lessons in this guide. It gives your students an early hands-on experience to discover the excitement that learning with the micro:bit offers.

#### It helps reinforce what your students already know about code and computing concepts by transferring them to the physical world through exploring preprogrammed micro:bits.

#### The exploration is also designed for you to model reviewing code together, helping your students make links between familiar computing concepts and their practical application by programming a physical device.

## Lesson preparation 
#### The lesson requires some short preparation to transfer the exploratory project onto micro:bits:

 - #### Watch the video
 - #### Put code onto micro:bits 

## Lesson format  
- #### **Warm-up:** Introduce the micro:bit and the activity.
- #### **Main activity:** Students work in pairs to explore pre-programmed micro:bits. They’ll explore different physical inputs and outputs while you challenge them to think about what computing concepts might be being used to make the program work. 
- #### **Wrap-up:** Discuss what they’ve discovered and look at the project code together. You’ll start to familiarize yourselves with the online Microsoft MakeCode block editor. You can optionally follow this with another lesson where students recreate the code for themselves. 

## Equipment list
#### **You will need:**
- #### Access to the MakeCode online editor on the teacher’s computer.
- #### Several micro:bits with micro USB cords. One micro:bit for every two to three students is ideal. 
- #### A power source for the micro:bits. Battery packs are best, but you can also power them from computer USB ports.
