**Content: Unit 5 Lesson 8** -- condiitonals, if statments

The statement is "a < b" and since a = 5, b = 10, and 5 is less than 10, then the statement is true. Following the arrow for a "true" statement, the computer is told to print the value of b. As the value of b is 10, the program will display "10."
