Learning Objective: **4.1.1** and Essential Knowledge statements: **4.1.1D, 4.1.1A**
<hr>
 (A) 1. This option is incorrect.  This is the position the arrow would be in if the code had repeated 4 times rather than 6.


<hr>
 (B) 2. This option is incorrect.  The square the arrow is in is correct, but it is facing in the wrong direction.  Forgetting to rotate or rotating in the wrong direction is a common mistake.

<hr>
 (C) 3. This option is incorrect.  If the code had repeated 3 times, then the arrow would be in this location.

<hr>
 (D) 4. This option is correct.  The arrow is in the correct square and facing in the correct direction.
