# Putting It All Together 
Great job learning the foundations of coding and computer science. Let's review: An **algorithm** is like a recipe, providing step-by-step instructions for solving a problem. 

## Control Structures

##### You learned about 3 types of control structures to use in algorithms. 

* ##### **Sequences**  are the ordered sets of instructions within an algorithm, guiding the computer through the logical flow of tasks.
* ##### **Loops** introduce the concept of repetition, allowing certain instructions to be executed multiple times, streamlining the code and making it more efficient.
* ##### **Conditionals** bring decision-making into play, enabling the program to take different paths based on specific conditions. 

##### With these three types of control structures, endless possibilities are imaginable within our code.
