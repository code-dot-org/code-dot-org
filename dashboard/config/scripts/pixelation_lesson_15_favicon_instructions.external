<img src = "https://code.org/images/cspunit1/code-pixel.png" align=right width=50 hspace=20>
A favicon is a small image, usually 16x16 pixels, that is typically shown in a web browserâ€™s address bar next to the title of the page or web address for a particular site. It is typically a small version of a company logo or some other symbol for the site. A favicon for Code.org is shown to the right.

Favicons are designed by artists and programmed into web pages by web designers. Below are some examples of favicons &mdash; you might recognize some!

**Directions:**

* After you have finished your favicon, share it with others in the class by sending them the bits with the Internet Simulator Widget!
