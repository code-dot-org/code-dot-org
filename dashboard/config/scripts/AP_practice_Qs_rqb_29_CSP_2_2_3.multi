MARKDOWN

Learning Objective: **2.2.3** and Essential Knowledge statements: **2.2.3F**
<hr>
 (A) This option is incorrect. The output will be false if both inputs are false

<hr>
 (B) This option is correct. So long as A or B are true, the entire circuit is true as an or gate only needs one true input to be true.

<hr>
 (C) This option is incorrect. It is only necessary for one input to be true for an or gate to be true

<hr>
 (D) This option is incorrect. The output will be true so long as one input is true
