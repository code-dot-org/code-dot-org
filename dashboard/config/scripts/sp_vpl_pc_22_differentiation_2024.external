This might mean modifying the lesson plan for the whole class, modifying activities for individual students, or other modifications necessary to support learning within your classroom.

## Three Ways to Differentiate Lessons:

* #### **Differentiate by task:** Differentiated tasks allow students to practice a new skill or demonstrate mastery of a concept while providing flexibility in the product or program they create. 
* #### **Differentiate by timing:** For some tasks, you may find students need differing amounts of time to complete tasks. Being flexible with deadlines and helping students set individual goals for their work can help meet the unique needs of each student.
* #### **Differentiate by resources:** Learning to use resources is a key goal of the course, and given resources provide an opportunity for students to self-differentiate in how they interact with key course content.
