## Prediction Discussion


#### While you may not fully understand the code yet, you can infer it calculates a dog's age in "dog years" by looking at the variable names and the output message.

### **You may have noticed**: 

- #### Variable types: int, str, and list
- #### concatenation in the print() function
- #### simple math expressions

#### The goal at this stage isn't for your students to master these concepts yetâ€”those skills will come in later lessons. Instead, the focus is on encouraging your students to analyze and discuss the code, sparking critical thinking about how it works.
