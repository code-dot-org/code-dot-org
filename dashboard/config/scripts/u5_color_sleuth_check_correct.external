# Next Step - Activating buttons

M: 
Okay great we can produce random game boards!

What next?

A: 
I think the next thing would be to add click-functionality to the buttons.

M:
Yeah, where if you click on a button we check whether it's the right one or not.
So we're going to need 4 event handlers, one for each button.

A:
Right. Actually I'm thinking this would be a great time for another function. That will save us from writing the same code over and over again in each event handler.

The function should:
* check whether they hit the right button or not
* update the score

M:

Ooh, and we should also change the game board every time a button is clicked, too.

A:

Good thinking.  We put that in this function too since it's called on every button click.  Let me sketch out what I'm thinking...

M: 
I get it. Cool. So now my question is: How will the function know which button is correct?

A: 
Hmm.  Good question. 

M: 
Oh, what if we just made the variable that stored the id of the button we randomly choose, to be a global variable.  That way every time `setBoard()` is called, it generates a new random id and it becomes a global variable that any other function can look at.  

Here, let me add to the sketch...

A:
Ok, good.  `randButtonId` is actually the "correct" button to click in the game, and it's now a global variable. But now checkCorrect() needs a way to know both *which button was hit* so we can compare it to `randButtonId`.    

M:
What if we gave checkCorrect a parameter.  So if you call checkCorrect("button3") for example, it checks whether "button3" is correct and updates the score. 

A: 
I see, good idea.  And if the function parameter contains the Id of the button that was clicked, *and* now that `randButtonId` is global, we can write our if-statement to check if they clicked on the "correct" button.

Here, I'll sketch it out...

M:
Nice. But, wow, that's a lot to change.  

A:
True, but I'm glad we thought this out on paper first. I think we can do it. We shouldn't do it all at once, though.  We should do it in steps, and at each step verify that the change is working.

M:
Let's just do that with `console.log` messages.  At each step will just add `console.log` messages to verify that things are working, and we can remove them later if we want.

A:
Yeah. Let's take in pieces. I suggest:

1. Add global var for correct button
2. Add 4 event handlers
3. Add function checkCorrect(id)
4. Add if-statement to verify correctness.

M: 
Let's do it.
