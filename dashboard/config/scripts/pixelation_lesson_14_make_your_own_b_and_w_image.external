**Directions:**

* Encode an image of anything you like.
* You might want to do some planning and sketching with graph paper first.
* DO NOT simply make an abstract pattern, like a checkerboard. 
* Depict something, perhaps your name written out, your initials, an icon or logo of some sort.
* Get creative! The image doesn't have to be a perfect square, it can be long and skinny.
* Optional: for fun, send your image bits to a friend using the <a href ="https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit1/stage/11/puzzle/2" target="_blank">sending bits widget.</a> *(note: this is just a link to the sending formatted text level from a couple of classes ago)*
