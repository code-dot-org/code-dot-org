**Directions:**

* Encode an image of anything you like.
* You might want to do some planning and sketching with graph paper first.
* DO NOT simply make an abstract pattern, like a checkerboard. 
* Depict something, perhaps your name written out, your initials, an icon or logo of some sort.
* Get creative! The image doesn't have to be a perfect square, it can be long and skinny.
* Optional: for fun, send your image bits to a friend using the sending bits widget.
