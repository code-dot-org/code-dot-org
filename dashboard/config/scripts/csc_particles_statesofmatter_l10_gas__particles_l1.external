# States Of Matter
Look around you. Everything you can see is matter. This is the special name that scientists use to describe the stuff that everything is made of. Matter behaves and looks differently depending on many different factors.

All matter is made up of tiny, individual particles called atoms. These tiny atoms move and change their behavior which make matter appear in either **solid**, **liquid**, or **gas** form.

## Gas Matter

Gas is the third state of matter. They are very light and float around. Once gas you probably see regularly is water vapor floating out of a boiling pot of water. In this case, the atoms in the water begin moving more and more quickly and farther apart until they flay apart!

The gas particles are free to move around and are no longer connected. For this reason, gas molecules spread out into the container or space they’re in. Molecules of gas can also be compressed. In this case, the atoms are pushed closer together. 

Although you can’t always see gas, you can tell gas molecules exist. For example, if you blow air into a balloon, you can see that the air fills up the balloon. You can see gas being compressed when you squeeze a part of the balloon and force the air into a smaller space.
