# Practice Performance Task in Unit 5

## Lesson 18: Practice PT: Create your Own App

**Lesson Type:** Programming| Practice PT |App Lab 

<a href = “https://curriculum.code.org/csp/unit5/18/” target=_blank> Lesson Plan Link <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"/></a>

To conclude the unit, students will design an app based off of one they have previously worked on in the programming unit. Students will choose the kinds of improvements they wish to make to a past project in order to show their ability to make abstractions and implement complex algorithms. The project concludes with reflection questions similar to those students will see on the AP® Create Performance Task. Students can either complete the project individually or with a partner, but for this practice PT, every student will need a collaborative partner with whom they will give and receive feedback.

A skill that programmers must develop is the ability to plan and execute a project from idea all the way through shipping of a product. Some of the best apps are new ideas brought on by the past work of a programmer themselves or other programmers. In order to execute these new ideas programmers must identify the programming structures needed to implement their idea and create a project plan. Often there are deadlines on projects which require programmers to make choices about the top features which need to be in a release of a new product. Finally, programmers must be able to express to others the work they have done to create their app.  Students should leverage their insights from lesson ten in which they considered how ‘experts’ would approach writing an app.  Those insights likely included:

- There is no one “correct” way to approach writing a program
- You don’t write programs “in order” from top to bottom - you write in pieces and organize the code into sections and functions.
- Start with a small problem to solve - solve it and move to the next one
- Use a buddy or “thought partner” to talk things through
- Sketch out pseudocode on paper to get your thoughts straight
- If you get stuck, there is always something small you can do to make progress

>**Note:** This is NOT the official AP Performance Task that will be submitted as part of the Advanced Placement exam; it is a practice activity intended to prepare students for some portions of their individual performance at a later time.
