# Unit 3: Lesson 10 - Buttons on the Screen

## Background

In the previous lesson you were introduced to event-driven programming with an unplugged activity. In this lesson you'll begin to develop your own event-driven programs by adding elements (like buttons) to the screen and attaching event handlers to allow your program to respond to events (like a mouse click).

## Vocabulary

* **Event:** a user action or other occurrence that can be detected by a program. Events can be used to trigger execution of specified blocks of code
* **Event Handler:** indicates which commands should run when a specified event occurs

## Lesson

* Create an event-driven program with a button.
* Program the button with an event handler. 
* Write a function to drive the turtle with a button click.
