#Review of Concepts from the Summer Workshop

### Overview

During the summer we started to dig into Interactive Animations and Games. Already we have:

* Engaged in Lessons 2, 3, and 4
* Explored Game Lab 
* Learned about plotting shapes using a grid
* Used parameters to change the size of our shapes. 


In Module 1, we will continue our exploration of Interactive Animations and Games content as we build on the skills we learned over the summer.
