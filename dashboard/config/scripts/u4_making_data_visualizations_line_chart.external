# Making a Line Chart

You can use many different kinds of charts to look at the same data. You'll now investigate different columns of your data with a **line chart**. Line charts are helpful for showing the progression of values over time. In this case you will be showing how the average movie rating changes with the reviewer’s age.

## Select Data

**Do This:** Select the **“age,”** **“avg rating women,”** and **“avg rating men"** columns.

* Select the first column of data using the mouse.
* Hold down the **"Control"** key, (or **"Command"** on a Mac) and select the additional columns of data.

<details><summary>Using Hotkeys</summary>
To select cells in non-adjacent columns, you need to use some fancy hotkeys: <br><br>
1. First select the cells from the first column (i.e., A1 through A62) using the SHIFT+click combination. <br>
2. Then, hold down COMMAND (if using a Mac) or CONTROL (if using Windows) and click to select the first cell of the next column (i.e., D1).<br>
3. Finally, hold COMMAND/CONTROL **and** SHIFT simultaneously, then click to select the last cell in the new column (i.e., D62).<br>
4. Repeat steps 2-3 for any additional columns you want to select (i.e., F1 through F62).

## Insert Chart

**Do This:** Select **Insert -> Chart** from the main toolbar to open the Chart Editor.

* Set the chart type to **“Line chart.”**
* Check the boxes for **“Use row 1 as headers”** and **“Use column A as labels.”**
* Click **“Insert”** to add your chart to the spreadsheet.

*Change chart type and insert your line chart into the spreadsheet.*

## Do a Visual Check

At this point, your chart should look something like this:

Once your chart looks close to the one above, switch to **View** mode and take a moment to look at your visualization.

* What does this chart help you notice about the data?
* For which ages were the average ratings similar between men and women?
* For which ages were they different?
* What other connections and trends can you see from this chart?

After you’ve thought about these questions, move your line chart off to the side of your spreadsheet. **Don’t delete it!** You will be coming back to it later in the lesson. Then move on to the next section to learn how to make a bar chart.
