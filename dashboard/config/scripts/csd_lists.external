# List

## Creating a List

Lists have many features which make them different from variables, but **most of what you've learned about variables also applies to lists**. For example, just like a variable:

* Lists should be given a **descriptive and meaningful** name.
* Lists are created using `var`.
* Lists can be initialized/set using `=`.

List commands can be found in the Variables toolbox.

The list command looks this:

This list contains 3 values: 100, 250, 500. Notice that the values are separated with commas `,` and that the entire list is enclosed in brackets `[ ]` . We can use `console.log` to display the contents of an list just like we would a variable.

This will print out [100, 250, 500] in the console area.
