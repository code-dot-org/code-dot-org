# List

## Creating a List

Lists have many features which make them different from variables, but **most of what you've learned about variables also applies to lists**. For example, just like a variable:

* Lists should be given a **descriptive and meaningful** name.
* Lists are created using `var`.
* Lists can be initialized/set using `=`.

**Example: Creating a List**

This list contains 3 values: 100, 250, 500. Notice that the values are separated with commas `,` and that the entire list is enclosed in brackets `[ ]` . We can use `console.log` to display the contents of an list just like we would a variable.

This will print out [100, 250, 500] in the console area.

## Accessing Items of List

A list is comprised of many locations. You can individually set or reference the information at each location of your list just like a variable. To tell your locations apart each has a separate number, or **index**, that identifies it.

Lists in JavaScript are **zero-indexed** which means the first index is 0. This is similar to binary number systems which begin counting at 0. For example a list of 10 items would have indexes 0-9. As a result **the last index is always one less than the length of the list**.

**Accessing List Items by Index:** If you know the index of the item you wish to access you can reference it using square brackets `list[index]` . The example below prints the value of the 4th element in the list.
