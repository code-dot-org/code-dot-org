# AI Code of Ethics

##### As a part of the AI and Machine Learning unit, students will conduct research using articles and videos that expose ethical pitfalls in an Artificial Intelligence area of their choice. Afterward, each group will develop at least one solution-oriented principle that addresses their chosen area. These principles will then be assembled into a class-wide “Our AI Code of Ethics” resource (e.g. a slide presentation, document, or webpage) for AI creators and legislators everywhere.

## Overview

##### In small groups, students conduct research using articles and videos that expose ethical pitfalls in an Artificial Intelligence (AI) area of their choice. Afterward, each group develops at least one solution-oriented principle that addresses their chosen area. These principles are then assembled into a class-wide “Our AI Code of Ethics” resource (e.g. a slide presentation, document, or webpage) for AI creators and legislators everywhere.
