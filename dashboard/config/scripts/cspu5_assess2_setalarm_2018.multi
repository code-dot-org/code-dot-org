Consider the JavaScript code segment below. Which statement should be used in place of &lt;missing code&gt; such that the alarm is set to 9:00 am on weekends, and 6:30 am on weekdays.

      var day = prompt("What day is it tomorrow?");
      if ( <missing code> ){
      	setAlarm = “9:00am”;
      } 
      	else {
      	setAlarm = “6:30am”;
      }

**Content: Unit 5 Lesson 8**

Inside the IF statement, the alarm is set to 9:00am. The alarms should only be set to 9:00am if it is a weekend so therefore, the IF statement should check if it is the weekend or not. Since there are 2 weekend days and 5 weekdays, it would be easier to check if it was a Saturday or a Sunday. 

Inside IF statements:

* Two equal signs in a row "==" are used to see if the values are equal and
* Two vertical lines "||" checks if one _or_ the other statement is true
* Alternatively, the notation "&&" means "and" which checks if both statements are true
* Therefore, to check if the day EQUALS "Saturday" OR if the day EQUALS "Sunday", the code is written as

(day == “Saturday”) || (day == “Sunday”) which will be true if the day is a weekend or, if it is a weekday, this statement will be false.
