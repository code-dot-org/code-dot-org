# Unit 1: Lesson 2 - Sending Binary Messages

## Background

One of the most simple forms of communication is the transmission of a binary message. Interestingly enough, “binary” is not a computing term. The word “binary” is used to describe something that can be in one of only two possible states. For example, the question, "Do we have a quiz today?" is a binary question, as there are only two possible responses: "yes" and "no.” In fact, any question that can only be answered with a "yes/no” or "true/false” or something along those lines would be considered a binary question. It is also possible to make a question binary by limiting the acceptable responses to two, as in, “Which do you prefer: Coke or Pepsi? Country music or hip hop?”

## Vocabulary

__Binary Question:__ a question to which there are only two possible answers

__Binary Message:__ a message that can only be one of two possible values
