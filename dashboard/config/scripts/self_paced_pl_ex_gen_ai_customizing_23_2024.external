# Final Project: Solving Community Problems with Chatbots

#### In the final project of this curriculum, **students create a chatbot that addresses a personally relevant issue or an issue in their community**. 

#### Students rely on the user-centered design strategies they‚Äôve seen throughout the unit to create issue statements, design a chatbot, perform user testing, and reflect on the results. Optionally, students can design a presentation on their project and the problem it was designed to address.

## The Design Thinking Process

#### In this project students will work through the **Design Thinking Process**. The process involves five steps that teams use to understand users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems, and create innovative solutions. 

### Cyclical Design Process 

#### Students will use this process throughout this unit as they work towards developing a prototype for a computer vision product. It involves understanding users, defining problems, brainstorming solutions, creating prototypes, and testing them while emphasizing a **user-centric mindset**.

### Why use this process?

#### By practicing these steps, students will learn to continuously improve their ideas and ultimately develop their own prototypes. This cyclical process helps students build creativity and problem-solving skills in a practical, hands-on way.


## Up Next!
#### Explore the steps students will go through when completing their projects.
