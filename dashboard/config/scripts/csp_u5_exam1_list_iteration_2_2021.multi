```
var words = [“apple”,”bug”,”car”,”dream”,”ear”, “food”]
var filteredWords = [];
for(var i = 0; i < words.length; i++){
  var word = words[i];
  if (word.length < 4){
    appendItem(filteredWords,word)
  }
}
console.log(filteredWords);
```

If the program above is run, what will be displayed in the console?

**Explanation:** Since the Boolean expression `word.length < 4` will only evaluate to `true` for words with 3 letters or fewer, those are the only words from the list `words` that will be added to the list `filteredWords`.

Students wrote a very similar program meant to filter a list of names based on their length in [Lesson 11 - Traversals Practice](https://studio.code.org/s/csp5-2021/lessons/11)
