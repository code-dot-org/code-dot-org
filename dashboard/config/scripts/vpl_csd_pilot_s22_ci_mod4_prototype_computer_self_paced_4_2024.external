# Lesson 5: User Interfaces - App Navigation

## Navigation Diagrams

##### When creating a prototype, it is often useful to also create a **navigation diagram**. A **navigation diagram** illustrates the relationship between screens by showing which buttons or behaviors take the user to a different place.

##### The navigation diagram below describes how each screen of this prototype is connected to other screens. Each arrow connects an element (such as a button, image, or icon) to another screen of the app. Combined with the UI screens, this diagram allows the student acting as the computer to “use” the paper prototype as if it were a real app.

## Prototype Testing

##### Your students will go through this process in pairs, so it's helpful to preview it. Read the instructions for prototype testing below. 

##### **Note**: In a pair, one student will act as the "computer", while the other will act as the user. The user should act as if they know _how_ to run an app, but are unfamiliar with this particular app to replicate the user experience.

### **Rules for the Computer:**

##### The role of the student acting as the "computer" is to take input from the user and respond accordingly.

* ##### Place the first screen in front of the **User**.
* ##### Place the rest of the screens off to the side.
* ##### When the user clicks on a card, refer to the **navigation diagram**.
* ##### If the clicked element has a line, switch to the screen that the line links to.
* ##### If the clicked element doesn’t have a line, don’t do anything.
