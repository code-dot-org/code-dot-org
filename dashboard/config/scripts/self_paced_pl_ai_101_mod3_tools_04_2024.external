# Using AI Tools

#### When utilizing AI tools, it is crucial to exercise continuous human oversight to ensure the outputs align with real-world needs and ethical standards. AI, while powerful, lacks the personal understanding and context that you as educators possess about your students' unique backgrounds, abilities, and learning styles.

#### Always approach AI-generated content with a critical mind, questioning and verifying its appropriateness and accuracy before application. For instance, while an AI can suggest customized learning plans, it cannot fully grasp individual emotional nuances or interpersonal dynamics that might influence a student's educational experience. Educators should use AI as an aid, not a replacement, integrating their insights and expertise to refine and adapt AI suggestions, thereby enhancing their effectiveness and relevance in real educational settings.
