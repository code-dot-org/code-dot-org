# Unit 4: Lesson 9 - Practice PT - Tell a Data Story

## Background

We collect data to learn about the world and test our hypotheses about the patterns and relationships that might otherwise be invisible. Computational tools now make it possible to quickly collect and analyze vast amounts of data, but those processes still depend on knowledgeable and thoughtful people who understand the data being used and can clearly present the conclusions draw from it. For this Practice PT you will be doing just that with the data you and your classmates have collected.

## Lesson

* Discover and present an interesting "story" in the data your class collected.
* Create a visualization that presents your story.
* Complete the written responses to explain and interpret your visualization.
