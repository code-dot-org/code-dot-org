**Content: Unit 5 Lesson 4**

Solve this problem by going through the lines of code while keeping track of the value of each variable.
It is important to note that if a variable is assigned a new value, the lines of code that reference that variable afterwards also references the new value.

* At the very beginning, a = 0, b = 3, c = 4
* a = a + c which equals  0 + 4 = 4. Thus, variable "a" is changed to the value 4
* _Now, the value of "a" is set to 4_
* b = a + c which equals 4 + 4 = 8. Variable "b" now equals 8
* c = a + c which equals 4 + 4 = 8
* By the end of the program, a = 4, b = 8, and c = 8
