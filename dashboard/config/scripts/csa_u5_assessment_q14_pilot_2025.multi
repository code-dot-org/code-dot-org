Consider the following method.

```
public int findElement(int[][] values) {
  int found = values[0][0];
  int result = 0;
 
  for (int[] row : values) {
    for (int index = 0; index < row.length; index++) {
      if (row[index] > found) {
        found = row[index];
        result = index;
      }
    }
  }

  return result;
}
```

The `findElement()` method returns the column index of an element with the largest value in the two-dimensional array `values`.

Here's how the method works:

* The variable `found` is initialized with the value of the element at the first row and first column of the `values` array (`values[0][0]`).

* The variable `result` is initialized with 0, representing the column index of the element with the largest value found so far.

* The method then iterates over each row (`row`) in the `values` array using an enhanced `for` loop.

* Within the inner loop, it iterates over each element in the current row using a traditional `for` loop with an index variable `index`.

* If an element (`row[index]`) is found to be greater than the current `found` value, it updates the `found` variable to the new largest value and updates the `result` variable with the corresponding column index (`index`).

* The process continues, checking each element in the array to find the largest value and updating `found` and `result` accordingly.

* Finally, the method returns the value of `result`, which represents the column index of an element with the largest value in the two-dimensional array.

Therefore, the `findElement()` method returns the column index of an element with the largest value in the `values` array.
