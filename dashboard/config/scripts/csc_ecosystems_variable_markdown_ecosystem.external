#Variables as counters

As we code different solutions to overfishing we will need to keep track of how many fish have already been caught. We can do this by using a variable to store the number of fish caught.

##What is a variable?

Computers can store information like numbers and letters in a **variable.** Variables are like containers for the information to be stored in.

##What is a label?

The programmer labels each variable with a name that tells us what kind of information to expect.

The information in a variable can be updated over time, which comes in handy when we need a way to keep track of how many times something happens. Programmers refer to this type of variable as a **“counter”.** 


##Example
This programmer created a fishing game for preschoolers. Every time the user clicks on a fish, the program will update their score and print it on the screen. 
<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

##Set the Counter to 0

In this program we are using the variable labeled `score` to keep track of how many times the fish is clicked. The value of `score` is set to 0 when the user clicks “Run.” 
<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

##Adding +1 to the Counter

Each time a fish is clicked, the computer will add 1 to the number stored inside the `score` variable. If three fish are clicked the value of the `score` variable will be 3.

</div>

##Showing the Score

How will the preschooler know their score? There is a `print score` block that shows the user the current value of the variable at the top of the screen. 
<div style="text-align: center;">
