# App Lab

##### App Lab is a programming environment for developing projects and apps in JavaScript. A drag-and-drop editor allows students to add and edit page elements without having to write the underlying syntax. Working in either blocks or text, students define the behavior of these design elements using code.

## How will my students use App Lab in the Physical Computing Unit? 

##### Students use App Lab to create apps that interact with the circuit playground - for example, pressing a button on the screen and having the circuit playground make a noise. This is similar to many real-world apps that use a phone to control an external device, like changing the color of an LED light bulb using an app on your phone.

## What should I do if I don't know how to use App Lab? 

##### The Physical Computing Unit assumes a basic understanding of App Lab. If you are not familiar with App Lab, consider completing <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/applab-intro/lessons/1/levels/1" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this App Lab tutorial</a> before completing the remainder of this module. You might also consider having your students complete this tutorial if they are also new to App Lab.
