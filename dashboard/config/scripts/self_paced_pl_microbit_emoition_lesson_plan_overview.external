#### After exploring the features of your micro:bit in the Meet your micro:bit lesson and getting acquainted with micro:bit classroom, itâ€™s time to get coding! 

#### Remember that each pathway has 2 micro:bit lessons - Meet your micro:bit and a custom project to fit with the concepts and difficulty level of the pathway.

#### In this professional learning module, we will stick to the project in Grade 2 to practice the process. Remember the project might be different, but the process is the same. 

#### The **Emotion Badge** lesson is on the main pathway of **Grade 2**. In it, students program the micro:bit to show different emotion images when different buttons are pressed.

## Key Learning Concepts 

- #### **Events:** actions that cause something happen (e.g., press a button on the micro:bit to make something appear on the display)
- #### **Inputs:** information computers get from users or sensors (e.g., button press)
- #### **Outputs:** information users get from computers (e.g., LED display showing happy or sad image)
