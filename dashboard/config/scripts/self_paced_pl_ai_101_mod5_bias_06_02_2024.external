# Check for Understanding

## Answer: B

#### While there might not be a single "correct" answer, as teaching strategies can vary based on context and educational goals, facilitating a class discussion is generally the most constructive approach. It allows the teacher to leverage a student's curiosity and real-world example to deepen the class's understanding of digital literacy and ethics. This strategy promotes critical thinking, awareness of societal issues, and the understanding that technology is not neutral but reflects the biases of its creators and the data it's trained on.
