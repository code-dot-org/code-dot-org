## Assign a unit to a classroom section

##### When you created your classroom section, you likely selected a unit to assign to the section. Assigning a section to a unit and keeping that assignment up-to-date as the class progresses is helpful for two reasons: 

1. ##### **It ensures that your students will start in the right place when they sign in:** Students in a section will always start in the unit they were assigned to when they sign in. 

2. ##### **It makes it easier for you to view a section's most recent progress in the Teacher Dashboard:** When you view progress for a section in the Teacher Dashboard, each section will default to the unit they are currently assigned to. You can always change the unit you're viewing progress for at any time using the "Course or Unit" dropdown list.

## Hide and show content 

##### Teachers using Code.org's courses can use the "Visible / Hidden" feature, to choose which units and lessons their students can see and access. This feature can be used for a variety of reasons:

##### 1. **Keep students from rushing ahead:** if you want your students to not work past a certain lesson or unit, you can hide all the lessons or units that you don't want them to see yet. When it’s time to work on a lesson you’ve hidden, you can just switch the toggle back to “visible” again.
##### 2. **Make the course feel less overwhelming for students:** hide all the units or lessons the class isn't working on yet to make the course feel more approachable. Unhide units or lessons one-at-a-time when the class reaches that point in the course.
##### 3. **Shorten a course:** Have limited time to teach computer science? You can hide lessons or units you know you don't want to cover so your students don't see them. 

##### Teachers can hide full units by clicking the hide button on the course overview page or single lessons by clicking the hide button on individual lessons on the unit overview page.

## Assign a lesson using your learning management system: 

##### If you want to share a link to a Code.org lesson to your students outside of Code.org (via an email or in an LMS, etc.), look for the Send to Students button next to lessons on the Course or Unit overview page.

##### This button will allow you to choose between:

1. ##### Copying a link to the lesson to your clipboard - this will copy the lesson link to your clipboard so you can paste it into an email or post it in your LMS.
2. ##### Posting a link to the lesson to Google Classroom - this button will allow you to post a link to the lesson directly to your Google Classroom, if you have one. <a href="https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/360049865752" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Click here</a> for more detailed instructions.

##### The Lesson Link will point to either the first level in the lesson if there are online activities for this lesson OR to the Student Resources for the level if there are not online activities for that lesson. Students will be required to sign in when they click on the link (learn more).
