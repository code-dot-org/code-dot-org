# Module 5: CS Discoveries Virtual Professional Learning

## Module 5 Overview

Welcome to the asynchronous work for Module 5 for CS Discoveries!  

The asynchronous work here will feed into the upcoming synchronous workshop of this module and help you understand the content and curriculum as you prepare to teach your own students. The asynchronous work for Module 5 takes about 90 minutes to complete.  Feel free to start and stop at your own pace.

Module 5 introduces the Data and Society unit and focuses on the theme of "Learning in Context". "Learning in Context" is the idea that learning should begin with the "why" before moving on to the "how". As you progress through this asynchronous work, continue to build from the previous modules, on how the role of the teacher and student supports "Learning in Context".

**During this asynchronous work you will:**

* Preview Data and Society, Chapter 1 content which focuses on representation systems
* Become familiar with the Problem Solving Process for **Data**
* Become familiar with the Pixelation Widget in Code Studio
* Reflect on how to equitably improve access and diversity in CS at your school

### Let's get started!
