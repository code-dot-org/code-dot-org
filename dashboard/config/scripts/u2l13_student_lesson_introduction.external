## Unit 2: Lesson 13 - The Need for Encryption

# Background

Encryption is a process - an algorithm - for transforming a message so that the original text is hidden from anyone who is not the intended recipient. This is often called a “secret code.” Reversing the encryption process to reveal the original message is called decryption. History is full of examples of people encrypting messages and attempting to crack secret codes.

# Vocabulary

* **Algorithm**: a sequential process for solving a problem.

* **Encryption**: encoding a message with an algorithm so that it is unreadable.

* **Decryption**: reversing the encryption process to reveal the original message.

* **Locks and keys**: common terms for encryption and decryption algorithms.

* **Caesar Cipher**: an encoding technique that shifts letters of the alphabet by a fixed amount.

* **Random Substitution**: an encoding technique that maps each letter of the alphabet randomly to different letters or characters.


# Lesson

* Think about the uses of encryption on the Internet.
* Encrypt a message with a secret algorithm.
* Test the security of your encryption.
