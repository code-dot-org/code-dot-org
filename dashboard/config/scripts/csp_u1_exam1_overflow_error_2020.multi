question 'Your computer uses 4 bits to represent decimal numbers (0, 1, 2, 3 and so on) in binary. What is the SMALLEST number for which an overflow error occur?’
wrong ‘14’
wrong ‘15’
right ‘16’
wrong ‘17’

**Explanation:** The 4-bit binary number `1111` represents the decimal number 15. Counting up to the next number, 16, will cause the 4-bit binary number to overflow to `0000` just like an odometer.

Overflow was covered in [Lesson 5 - Overflow and Rounding](https://curriculum.code.org/csp-20/unit1/5/) and can be explored using the [Odometer Widget](https://studio.code.org/s/odometer/stage/1/puzzle/1)

::: details [**Essential Knowledge Connected To This Question**]

DAT-1.B.1: In many programming languages, integers are represented by a fixed number of bits, which limits the range of integer values and mathematical operations on those values. This limitation can result in overflow or other errors.
