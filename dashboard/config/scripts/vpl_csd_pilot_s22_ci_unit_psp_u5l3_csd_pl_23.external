#### Below, you will find more information about the Problem Solving Process with Design. You **do not** need to study these carefully before progressing, nor do your students need to complete each bullet point within Define, Prepare, Try, and Reflect. Just take a moment to review each section, as you'll be introducing the following as a guiding framework to your students.

### üîé **Define**
* #### Decide what problem you are trying to solve or what question you are trying to answer.
* #### Make sure you understand your target audience (it could be you!) and what specifically it needs.
* #### Identify the parts of your problem you could address with data. How could more information about your question or problem help?

### üìù **Prepare**
* #### Decide what kinds of data you will collect.
* #### Decide how you will collect the data and what format you will collect it in.
* #### Anticipate possible challenges in data collection and change your plan to account for them.
* #### Develop a plan for how you will analyze your data and make sure your data will be useful for that kind of analysis.

### üñ•Ô∏è **Try**
* #### Collect your data using the plan you created.
* #### Clean your data by removing errors, unexpected values, and inconsistencies. 
* #### Visualize the data by creating tables, graphs, or charts that help you see broad trends in your data. 
* #### Interpret the trends and patterns in your visualizations based on your knowledge of the problem.

### ü§î **Reflect**

* #### Review what you‚Äôve learned about your question or problem. What did you learn?
* #### Has what you learned solved your problem or allowed you to make a decision. 
* #### Based on what you learned, do you need to go back to one of the previous steps?
