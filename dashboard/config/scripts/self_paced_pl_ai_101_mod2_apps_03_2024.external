# Practice

#### Let’s practice using AI to learn more about AI and its impact.

## Educator’s Choice

#### Everyone is going to research the impact of AI, but the topic you research will be based on your role.

<details style="background-color: #ececec; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; border: 1px solid transparent; border-radius: 5px;">
    <summary style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;">Content Area Teachers</summary>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; padding-bottom:20px;">
    <p>

#### Prompt the AI to learn more about how AI is impacting your content area.

#### For example, if you teach biology, you may choose to learn about the latest in AI technology in biomedical fields.

    <summary style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;">Elementary Teachers</summary>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; padding-bottom:20px;">
    <p>

#### Prompt the AI to learn more about how AI is impacting the development of young students.

#### For example, you could learn more about how access to voice assisted AI technology (like Siri) is impacting communication skills.

<details style="background-color: #ececec; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; border: 1px solid transparent; border-radius: 5px;">
    <summary style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;">Administrators</summary>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; padding-bottom:20px;">
    <p>

#### Prompt the AI to learn more about how AI is affecting administrative and leadership tasks.

<details style="background-color: #ececec; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; border: 1px solid transparent; border-radius: 5px;">
    <summary style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;">Wildcard (Anyone)</summary>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; padding-bottom:20px;">
    <p>

#### Prompt the AI to learn more about how AI is effecting a field you’re interested in.

#### For example, if you’re curious about dinosaurs you could see how advances in AI have been affecting paleontology.

## To Do
#### Now that you have your research topic, choose an LLM (ChatGPT, Copilot, or Gemini) to prompt.

## Tips and Tricks

* #### When you’re prompting the AI don’t just stop after the first prompt! Keep asking it more questions and diving deeper.
* #### For more accurate and helpful responses, try to be as detailed as possible in your requests. The more context you provide, the better LLMs can tailor their answers to your needs.
* #### Don’t forget to use the feedback mechanisms to improve your experience. Whether it’s clarifying misunderstandings, asking for further details, or simply exploring different approaches, your interactions can help guide the conversation to more effectively meet your goals.
* #### Keep your critical thinking cap on. Don’t trust the AI at face value. We’ll learn more about AI and misinformation in a future module, but for now use your better judgment and fact check anything that maybe doesn’t sound right.
