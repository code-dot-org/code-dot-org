<hr>
 (A) This answer is correct. The DMCA does not address liability for misuse of owners\' intellectual property.

<hr>
 (B) This answer is incorrect. The DMCA specifically gives copyright owners the right to digitally protect their intellectual property and criminalizes creating or using tools designed to bypass those protections.

<hr>
 (C) This answer is incorrect. A 2015 update to the DMCA specifically allows owners of legally acquired games to create and use ways to bypass authentication if the original game server used to facilitate local network play is no longer available.

 (D) This answer is incorrect. The "safe harbor" provision of the DMCA exempts online service providers from the responsibility of monitoring user-posted content for legality as long as they are not charging money for their service and they comply with "takedown" notices when infringing material is brought to their attention by the copyright owner.
