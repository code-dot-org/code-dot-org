Consider the code segment below given in pseudo code (see reference above).  Assuming that variables a, b and c *already have numeric values assigned to them*, what is the expected output of this code segment?

    val <- a
    IF(b >= a AND b >= c){
    	val <- b;
    }
    ELSE 
    {
      IF (c >= a AND c >= b)
        {	
        val <- c;
        }
    }
    DISPLAY (val);

**Content: Unit 5 Lesson 8, 9** - compound conditionals and else-if

Going through this code line by line:

* Set `val` to `a` -- assume it's the largest
* If `b` is bigger than both `a` and `c` -- then b is the largest
* Else if `c` is bigger than both `a` and `b` -- then c is the largest

Display `val` which should be the largest of the 3.
