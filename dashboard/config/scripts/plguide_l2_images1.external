## Code.org Photo Libraries

<h4>

 Our photography is for documents and reporting created internally, by the Code.org team only. This is because subjects in the photo must sign photo releases in order for us to use their likeness, and these photo releases do not cover external partners using our photography. This is especially important because most of our photos include children under 18. If you have a question about whether or not you can use Code.org imagery, email  <a href="marketing@code.org" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marketing@code.org</a>
