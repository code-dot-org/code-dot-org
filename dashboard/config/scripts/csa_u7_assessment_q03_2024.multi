What output will be produced by this program?

```

  public static void myeval(int x, int y) {
    x = x + y;
    y = y * x;
    System.out.println(x + " " + y);
  }

  public static void main(String[]args) {
    int a = 6, b = 3;
    myeval(a,b);
    System.out.println(a + " " + b);

The method `myeval(int x, int y)` takes two parameters, `x` and `y`, and modifies them, but these changes do not affect the original variables `a` and `b` because Java is pass-by-value. This means that it passes a copy of the variable, not the actual reference.

Let's see step-by-step what happens in the code:

1. The `main` method declares `a` as 6 and `b` as 3.

2. The `myeval` method is called with arguments `a` and `b`. So, `x` becomes `6` and `y` becomes `3` within `myeval`.

3. `x` is updated to `x + y`, which is `6 + 3 = 9`.

4. `y` is updated to `y * x`, which is `3 * 9 = 27`.

5. The `myeval` method prints `x` and `y`, which are `9` and `27`, respectively.

6. After the `myeval` method ends, control returns to the `main` method, but `a` and `b` remain unchanged because the changes were made to the copies `x` and `y`, not the original variables. 

7. The `main` method prints `a` and `b`, which are `6` and `3`, respectively.

So, the output of the program will be:

```
9 27
6 3
```
