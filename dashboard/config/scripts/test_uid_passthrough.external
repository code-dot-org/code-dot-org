# AP Counseling Scenario Session

## “AP is not for Me”
For this session we'll use a tool called "Teacher Moments", which has been developed by our partners at MIT. In this specific Teacher Moments called “AP is not for Me”, you will practice counseling a student around taking the CSP AP exam. The conversation was designed utilizing interviews with CS teachers and their experiences talking with students about the AP exam.

## How it Works
When interacting with the Teacher Moments scenario, you will be guided through a simulated conversation. Please respond to the statements made by the student as best as you can. This simulation will use your phone’s or computer’s microphone to record your voice. We recommend using the Chrome browser for the best experience. You’ll have a chance to review your own responses at the end of the simulation. During the session, we will discuss your thoughts on counseling the student as a group.
