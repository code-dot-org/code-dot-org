**Content: Unit 5 Lesson 8**

Going through the code line by line:

* A variable "age" is set to 35
* Going into the IF statement, it checks if age is less than 35. 35 is equal to 35 and NOT less than it so the condition is false.
* Therefore, since age is not less than 35, the program executes the code that is in the else statement.
* The program displays "You are old enough to be President!"
