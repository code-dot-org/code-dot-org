#### Your students and your classroom are unique. As you plan for each lesson, consider how you will customize the lesson plan to meet the needs of your students. Consider the following:

* ##### How will I group my students for group activities?
* ##### How will I check for understanding throughout the lesson?
* ##### What guiding questions will I use?
* ##### What engagement strategies will I use? 
* ##### What materials do I need to prepare ahead of time?
