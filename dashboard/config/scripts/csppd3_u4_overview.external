This Online PD is designed to help you ramp up for Unit 4 of the Code.org CSP curriculum. The lessons and activities here complement the one day in-person workshops that pilot teachers are completing throughout February, March, and April.

The best way we can help you prepare for Unit 4 is to provide space and time to get into the lessons, to see how they tie together, and to consider how you will use the materials provided in the lessons when you teach these concepts.

The lessons of Unit 4 fall into natural groupings based the topics of study. In this PD we’ll look at these lesson chunks, as outlined on the right. A curated selection of activities spanning these chunks have been selected for you to try out as part of this PD.

## PD Goals

- Develop a deeper understanding of the core concepts covered in Unit 4 of the CSP curriculum. 
- Experience and plan a lesson from Unit 4.
- Connect with other CSP pilot teachers to share your plans for the lesson.

## Prerequisites

This PD is intended to come *after* school has started, as you prepare to teach Unit 4.

## Course Duration

Completing this online module should take around 2 hours, depending on how deep into the lesson plans you go. Remember, the goal here is to help you prepare to teach Unit 4, so we recommend you complete it before you start teaching that unit.

## Completion

In order to receive credit for completing this PD, you will need to go through all of the levels here in Code Studio, which includes posting to the Code.org forum for CSP teachers. **In order to receive payment, you need to complete all levels, leaving each circle with a green checkmark, and complete all forum posts.**

> You have until June 30th, 2016 to complete this module, but **we highly recommend you use this resource as a tool to help you prepare to teach Unit 4.**

## Payment

Each of the 5 units in the CSP curriculum has a corresponding online module. You already completed Unit 1 online during your Blended Summer Study, and Unit 2 and Unit 3 online as part of your academic PD. This is the online module for Unit 4. Payment for your Phase 3 online work will be pulled twice during the academic year - once in the winter and once in the spring. You will be paid for whatever you've completed up to the day the payments are pulled.
