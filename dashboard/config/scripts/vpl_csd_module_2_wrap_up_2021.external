## Engage with the Code.org Community

Don't forget to check out the <a href="https://forum.code.org/" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code.org forum</a> for more ideas on implementing Unit 3 with your students. The forum is also a great place to go when you are looking for additional resources, ideas, and templates to use when implementing Code.org lessons with your students. Teachers within the community have created and shared some great ideas. Don't forget to share your ideas and resources too!
