Creating a positive classroom culture before you start writing programs with your class goes a long way. Discuss with your students the strategies they should try, either individually or with a partner, to help get themselves unstuck while trying to solve a puzzle or write a program. Having common vocabulary as a class can be very helpful, so that when a student asks you for help, you can ask them what parts of the puzzle-solving process they have executed. Here are the 4 main steps:
<ul>
<li>Understand the puzzle</li>
<li>Create a plan</li>
<li>Perform and perfect the plan</li>
<li>Check your work</li>
</ul>
