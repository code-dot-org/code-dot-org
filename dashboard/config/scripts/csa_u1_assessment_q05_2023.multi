Consider the following code segment.

```
if (myPainter.isFacingNorth()) {
  myPainter.move();
  myPainter.move();
}

if (!myPainter.isFacingNorth()) {
  myPainter.move();
  myPainter.paint("green");
}
```

Which of the following is equivalent?

teacher_markdown <<MARKDOWN
The condition `!myPainter.isFacingNorth()` is intended to execute a different block of code if the `Painter` object is not facing north, while the condition `myPainter.isFacingNorth()` moves the `Painter` object forward two spaces if it is facing north. This can also be written as an `if/else` statement so the alternate block of code executes if the `Painter` object is not facing north, or the condition `myPainter.isFacingNorth()` is `false`.
