##### An <b>event </b> is something that happens, such as a button being clicked, a key being pressed, or a sensor detecting motion.

##### In <b>event-based</b> programming, these events trigger specific actions or responses in the program. Events make our code interactive.

##### <b>Event blocks </b> are blocks of code that are associated with specific events. They define what should happen when a particular event occurs. These blocks are usually structured as event handlers and are *not connected* to the main section of your code. 

##### An <b>event handler </b>is a piece of code that is executed in response to a specific event.
