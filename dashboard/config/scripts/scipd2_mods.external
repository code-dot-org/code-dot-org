# Reviewing the Modules 

In the first half of Phase 2, you experienced some lessons in the comfort of a supervised classroom.  Take a moment to go over the modules that you played with during the in-person PD and revisit your associated projects.  Do they make any more sense to you now?

Each of these modules contains directions, standards, and a pacing guide.

## Module 1: Introduction to Computer Modeling and Simulation

A scaffolded series of highly-engaging design and build activities guide students through developing their first computer model in StarLogo Nova, a modeling and simulation environment developed at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

## Module 3: Ecosystems as Complex Systems

After learning more about ecosystem dynamics, producers and consumers, and interdependent relationships within an ecosystem, students develop their own model of a local ecosystem.

## Module 4: Chemical Reactions

The chemical reaction simulated is that of silver nitrate and copper.
