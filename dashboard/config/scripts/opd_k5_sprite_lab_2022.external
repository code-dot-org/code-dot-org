## Course Lesson Objective

After completing Lesson 8 you will be able to:

* define sprite and (sprite) behavior,
* add a sprite to the screen, 
* and change a sprite's behavior.

## CS Concepts

A **sprite** is a graphic character on the screen with properties that describe its location, movement, and look.

A **behavior** is an action that a sprite performs continuously until it's told to stop.
