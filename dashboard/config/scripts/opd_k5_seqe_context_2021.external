# Sequencing in Courses E and F

Course E transitions students to use sequencing to program **sprites**.  You will be introduced to sprites in Lesson 7 of this course.  

Course F continues to build and strengthen students' skills in programming sprites, as well as introduces advanced computer science concepts such as variables and for loops.  Variables are introduced in Lesson X and For Loops are introduced in Lesson X of this online course.
