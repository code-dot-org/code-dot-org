In the third chunk of lessons students build on their experience with encoding numbers and begin experimenting with representing text. In the first lesson of the chunk, students develop a protocol for sending a text message over the internet simulator, a task that calls for students to figure out how to encode the letters a-z in binary. Next, students learn about the ASCII protocol for encoding letters and layer on formatting so their protocols can include information about how the text looks (things like fonts, color, etc).  

On the next page we'll look at the one-page overview from each lesson, but remember that you can always see the [entire unit on Code Studio](https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit1/).
