#### **What unit will you teach first to your students? Why? Take 10-15 minutes to reflect on what you've learned about the CS Discoveries units so far.** Consider also:

* #### How long will you have with your students? (A year, semester, etc.)
* #### What resources will be available to you in your classroom(s)?
* #### What interests do you think or know your students might have?

#### If you'd like to give your eyes a break from looking at the computer, consider looking at the CS Discoveries Syllabus on pages 3-9 of your Resource Packet and jotting down your thoughts in your journal. You can always change your mind about which unit you'll be starting with.
