# Journaling

#### **Journaling** is a tool for individual reflection in a form that can be revisited as students develop their skills and understandings. This provides an important opportunity for students to reflect on their own learning in a personal way and record their growth.

#### Journaling can take many forms, but in general, it is a tool for individual reflection in a form that can be revisited as students develop their skills and understandings. This provides an important opportunity for students to reflect on their own learning in a personal way and record their growth throughout the course.

## What is my role as the teacher?

#### As the teacher, you play a role in making time for journaling. Students should have ample time to write out their thoughts and reflect on the learning activities they're experiencing in CS Discoveries.

#### CS Discoveries frequently provides opportunities for student journaling, often as a tool for individual sensemaking after having completed an activity as a class. When students are asked to journal, it is done with the assumption that they will have access to their journal writings throughout the course as a tool for review and reflection. Occasionally, students are also asked to revisit specific journal prompts. The medium used for journaling can vary, depending on classroom needs. Whichever format you choose should allow for consistent access by both the student and the teacher. The most common approaches include:

* #### **Physical Notebooks:** We recommend that notebooks be kept together and not allowed to leave the classroom. Composition book style binding tends to be more effective for this purpose, rather than spiral-bound notebooks.

* #### **Digital Documents:** Whether you use Google Docs, a blogging platform, or another computer-based tool, the most important thing to consider is your access as a teacher. Find a tool that allows you consistent access to the journal so that you may use it to check for understanding.

* #### Provide students a journal at the beginning of the school year.
* #### Prompt students to journal about specific challenges or bugs they encounter.
* #### Give students time to revisit previous journal entries and reflect on their growth.
