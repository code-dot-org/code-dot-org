**Wizzard:** Hello, scientists! Welcome to my magic show! Let me show you my vanishing trick...

**Wizzard:** I have a few objects I am going to put into this box. What goes in will come out… different. Is it a magic box? What is happening inside the box? Lets find out!

We put water in… Poof… The water vanished.

**Scientist:** The water did not disappear. Science can explain this. The matter changes state in the magic box. The water particles went in as a liquid and came out as a gas.

**Lets use a microscope to look closer..**
The liquid particles stay together in the glass. 
When the particles are heated, they move everywhere and escape the glass as a gas.
