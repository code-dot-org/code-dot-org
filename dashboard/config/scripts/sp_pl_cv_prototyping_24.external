#### The prototyping stage is the fourth step in the design thinking process, where the team brings their ideas to life through physical or digital models in order to **visualize and test** how these solutions might work in the real world.

#### The prototyping stage is iterative; based on feedback and testing, prototypes are refined, adjusted, or sometimes discarded. 

#### It’s a **hands-on phase** that encourages practical experimentation and learning, helping to quickly converge on the most effective and user-centered solution before final development begins.
