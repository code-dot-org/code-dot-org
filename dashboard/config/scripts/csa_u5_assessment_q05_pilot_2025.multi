Consider the following code segment.

```
int[][] arr = {{0, 1, 2}, {3, 4, 5}, {6, 7, 8}};
int value = 0;

for (int[] j : arr) {
  if (j[0] % 2 == 0) {
    for (int i = 0; i < j.length; i += 2) {
      j[i] = value;
      value++;
    }
  }
}

System.out.println(arr[2][2]);
```

What is printed as a result of running this code segment?

In the first iteration of the enhanced `for` loop, `j` represents the inner array `{0, 1, 2}`. Since the first element, `j[0]`, is even (divisible by 2), the inner loop is executed. It sets `j[0]` to the current value of `value` (0), and then increments `value` to 1.

In the second iteration of the enhanced `for` loop, `j` represents the inner array `{3, 4, 5}`. The first element, `j[0]`, is not even, so the inner loop is not executed.

In the third and final iteration of the enhanced `for` loop, `j` represents the inner array `{6, 7, 8}`. Since the first element, `j[0]`, is even, the inner loop is executed. It sets `j[0]` to the current value of `value` (2), and then increments `value` to 3.

After the loops, the code prints `arr[2][2]`, which corresponds to the element at the third row and third column of the `arr` array.

Since `arr[2][2]` is assigned the value of `3`, the output will be `"3"`.
