# Overview

In this multi-day lesson, the class uses the problem solving process from Unit 1 to create a platform jumper game.  After looking at a sample game, the class defines what their games will look like and uses a structured process to build them.  Finally, the class reflects on how the games could be improved, and implements those changes.
