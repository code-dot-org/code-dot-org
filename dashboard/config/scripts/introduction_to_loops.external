# Introduction to Loops


Loops are a simple way to repeat a block of code over and over again.  There are several different kinds of loops, but in this unit students will only be introduced to a simplified version (an abstraction) of a for loop. This abstraction is called a `Repeat Loop` and students are only able to change the value in the number to determine how many time the loop will run. 

## Connection to Earlier Lessons
Earlier in the unit, we used functions as a way to reduce replicating code. Here, we start using loops as a way to *directly* repeat the same action. (Meaning that if you’d like to use the same block of code later in the program, you’d need to rewrite the loop or put it inside of a function.)  Below are two examples that both produce a square using the turtle.  The program on the left makes use of functions, while the one on the right uses a single loop.

If you were planning to create a square multiple times, you could put the loop inside of a function:
