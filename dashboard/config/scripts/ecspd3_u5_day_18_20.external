# Unit 5 Lessons > Days 18 - 20

## Concepts Covered

Mean, Median, Minimum, Maximum, subset data, quantitative data, categorical data, box plots, histograms.

## Lesson Overview

This lesson gives students the chance to learn about statistical measures of mean, median, minimum, and maximum.  From there, students discuss possible ways to subset data and then look at box plots (bar graphs or bar charts) and histograms.  It will be important here to review quantitative vs categorical data from the previous lesson on bar charts.

Histograms are a way to group numbers into ranges.  They graphically display data using bars of different heights which corresponds to the relative frequency of the amount of data in a class.  It shows quantitative data.

Students will create a histogram of the amount of sleep each of the students got the previous night and then have a discussion based on what they see. It's important here to point out that a histogram is for quantitative data not categorical data.

Next, students will work with a subset of data from a survey of students by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), that addresses health issues facing students in the United States.  Students will learn how to find frequencies and descriptive statics, and participate in a discussion around the columns in the data set.

## Other Resources

- Histograms
	- **Good for:** showing frequency data, comparing multiple ranges of values and for consolidating large amounts of data into a limited number of categories.

## Things to Consider 
What types of visuals do you put up around your room to engage learners in your topic and help them make connections to the world around them? Consider how visualizations like this one could help students who may need more scaffolding.
