#### In this lesson, students act as **user testers** for a chatbot app and analyze the testing data to decide the next steps for the chatbotâ€™s development. They also explore the responsible use of AI, debating whether a chatbot should be launched despite discovered flaws. This lesson builds the foundation for the project at the end of the unit, where students will use the same testing structure.

Navigating these conversations so they elevate and honor the experiences of your students, while also keeping the conversation grounded and connected to the lesson content, requires careful consideration and intentionality as the discussions are happening.
