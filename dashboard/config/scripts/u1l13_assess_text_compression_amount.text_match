name 'U1L13 Assess Text Compression amount'
title 'Is this a good compression rate?'

markdown <<MARKDOWN
Here's the same compressed text that you saw on the last level, but now we also see the size of the original, uncompressed text. On the previous level you reconstructed the text by tracing back through the dictionary. Now we're going to think about if this is a "good" compression rate.

In the text box below, answer the following two questions:

- What is the compression rate, or the compressed text size + dictionary size compared to the original text size? (as a percentage) 
- Is this a "good" compression rate? Why or why not?

**answer to question 1:** 25.86%

**answer to question 2:** Students might note here that 25% compression is less than they got while playing with the tool with other poems on the previous levels, but that doesn't necessarily mean that this is poorly compressed. Students might reason about what counts as a good compression, and note that for any given file, we are limited on the amount of compression we can achieve based on the contents and how many patterns are present.
