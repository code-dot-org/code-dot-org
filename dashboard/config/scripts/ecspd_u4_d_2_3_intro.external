## Key Concepts

- Students will use the "when green flag clicked" block to complete the name project.

## Common Difficulties

Students will have the opportunity to write a program based on their own name.  Many students will want to do something elaborate, but not have the skill set to do so. Remind them that you will be spending the next month learning about all of the blocks in Scratch and how to use them to create really cool programs.

You'll be working off of the name.sb file and some students might struggle with saving and opening files in the Scratch environment.
