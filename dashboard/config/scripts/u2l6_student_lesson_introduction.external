## Unit 2: Lesson 6 - Algorithms Detour - Minimum Spanning Tree

# Background

One of the more common (and interesting) fields investigated in computer science is graph theory. Graph theory investigates connections - between people, locations, computers, ideas, information, or anything else. The Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) is a problem in the field of graph theory. The MST problem is especially interesting because it might have multiple “best” solutions.

# Vocabulary

* **Graph**: a diagram that shows the nodes and edges of a problem
* **Node**: sometimes called a vertex; typically represented as a labeled circle
* **Edge**: a line connecting two nodes
* **Cost**: sometimes called the weight; the number associated with an edge that indicates distance, time, or economic cost 
* **Cycle**: a set of edges that, begin at one node and can be followed through other nodes back where you started
* **Tree**: a set of edges that connects nodes together in a way that does not form a cycle


# Lesson

* Investigate graph problems
* Create an algorithm for solving a minimum spanning tree problem
* Compare your algorithm to Kruskal’s algorithm
