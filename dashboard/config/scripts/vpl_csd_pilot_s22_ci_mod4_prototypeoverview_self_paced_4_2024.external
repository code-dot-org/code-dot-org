# Paper Prototypes in Lesson 5

##### Throughout the Design Process unit, students will use **paper prototypes** as a quick tool to kick off the development of an app. Paper prototypes are an integral part of the entire unit.

##### Paper prototypes are first introduced in **Lesson 5: User Interfaces** as students learn how a simple paper prototype can be used to quickly test assumptions before programming the app.

###### **Note**: You've _briefly_ explored Lesson 5 (and Lessons 1-4) in an <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/self-paced-pl-csd-unit4-2-2023/lessons/1/levels/8" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">earlier level</a> of this module. This section will go more in-depth with the lesson.

## Prototype Testing Activity

##### In Lesson 5, students will work with a partner to test out a paper prototype for the "Txt Ur Grndkdz" app. One student will play the role of the User, interacting with the User Interface screens as if itâ€™s an actual app. The other student (the Computer) will take care of making sure the prototype responds as it was designed. 

##### **Students will:**
* ##### Collect and analyze feedback from user testing with a paper prototype.
* ##### Use a paper prototype to test the design of an app.

## Let's explore the Lesson 5 activity!
