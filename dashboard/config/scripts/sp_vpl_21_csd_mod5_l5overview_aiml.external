# Lesson 5: Classification Models 

## Lesson 5 Overview

##### **Question of the Day:** How do computers learn to classify data?

##### **Lesson Overview:** In this lesson students will participate in an unplugged activity simulating one of the machine learning algorithms computers use to separate data into groups to help make decisions. Students will be tasked with helping a computer learn to classify food as fruits or vegetables, graph 20 different fruits on two axes comparing "sweetness" to "easy to eat", and then try to separate the data into groups - a fruit area, and a veggie area.

##### **Students will be able to:** Explain how computers can separate data to make a decision

<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 30px;">The thing I love about this lesson is how visual it is. It gives students a shared experience that we can all refer back to later. Students have the chance to be the computer. They get to walk through each of the steps on a simplified level. By the end, they actually understand what A.I. Bot is doing when it is making a decision. 

This lesson also gave my students the opportunity to see that there is an element of opinion in classification systems. When deciding how sweet something is, there is not a right or wrong answer. It's an opinion. Later, when we started to see how bias can end up in AI, I was able to pull them back and remind them that the data used to train their models was based on choices. I am not sure that this light bulb moment happened during Lesson 5, but the lesson laid the foundation for the light bulb moment to happen later.

## Role of the teacher

##### Teachers are the key component that make lesson plans come alive for students. Teachers know their students best and are best positioned to make choices to increase engagement within a lesson. This might mean adding a visual or tactile aspect to an existing activity, incorporating movement, shifting a whole group discussion to a small group discussion, etc. Planning for engagement is an essential piece of planning for a Code.org lesson.

<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 30px; ">I found pictures of weird food and showed them to my students. This led to really good discussion. I asked questions like "Does that look good?", "Does that look hot or cold?", "Would you eat that?", and "What do you think that is?". I added this because my students need visuals to help them during discussions. This got them interested and fired up to start talking.</p>
