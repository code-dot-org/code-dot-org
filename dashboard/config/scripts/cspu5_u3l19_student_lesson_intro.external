# Unit 3: Lesson 14 - Controlling Memory with Variables

## Background
This lesson gets into the basic mechanics of controlling the computer's memory, by working with variables in programs.  

To keep things simple we're going to focus on some bare-bones examples so you get the basic ideas behind **creating and using variables.** We'll primarily just be displaying text in the console rather than enhancing an app for now.

We all want to make cool apps, but having **a good mental model** before you get in too deep will allow you to go further and faster later on.

**Understanding the typical pitfalls of learning variables for the first time**, combined with establishing a good mental model, will make working with memory and variables in the future much easier.

## Vocab

* **Variable:** In JavaScript (and most programming languages) the most primitive type of memory you can use is called a variable. It's called a variable because it's a piece of memory in which you can change what's stored - its value can vary.
* To **create** a chunk of memory to use in a program you use the `var` command.
* To **assign** a value to a variable means to store a value in memory; you use the `=` operator.
* Variable **re-assignment** typically means to change the value of a variable based on its current value.

## Lesson

* Understand the power of variables.
* Learn programming statements to create, initialize, and change the values stored in variables.
* Learn how to prompt a user for numeric input.
* Solve several small puzzles and challenges related to moving values around in memory.
