### Lessons in Code Studio

<a href="https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit4/stage/1/puzzle/1" target=_blank><strong>Stage 01- Introduction to Data</strong></a> Students take an online quiz and discuss what data could be collected from this quiz. Students brainstorm other places data could be collected in their lives. The Class Data Tracker project is introduced and students make their first of many daily entries into an online survey. Students develop hypotheses that they may be able to test once they have collected many days worth of data.

**Important Note:** The Class Data Tracker project is introduced in this lesson. Students will need to take a few minutes at the beginning of **each lesson in this chapter** in order to have the data **required to complete the Practice PT in Lesson 9**.
