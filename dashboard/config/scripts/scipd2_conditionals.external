## What is a Conditional Statement?

A conditional statement is one that explains what to do when a certain condition applies.

The "condition" is usually tested to see if it is true. If it is, then the next part of the statement tells what will happen. 

"If I touch the hot stove I will get burned." In this conditional statement, the condition is touching the stove. If I am touching a hot stove, then it is true. The rest of the statement tells what will happen if it is true (I will get burned). 

If I am not touching the hot stove, the condition as false, and the rest of the statement does not apply.

## How to Use Conditionals

When you want agents to change their behavior if a certain condition is true, use the “if” block.

In the block to the left, the program will check to see if the agent, in this case a rabbit, has energy that is less than or equal to zero.  If it does, it will delete the rabbit.  Otherwise, it does nothing.
