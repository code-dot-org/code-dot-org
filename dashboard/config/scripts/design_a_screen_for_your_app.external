# Mocking Up Your App

Now that you have some practice laying out elements in App Lab, you can start working on mocking your own app. With your group, divvy up the screens so that everyone is working on a different screen.

Because you'll be dividing the work up, you'll want to do some planning ahead of time to decide on a common look and feel for your pages. For example, you'll want to agree on things such as:

* Where do navigation buttons go?
* What colors will you use for backgrounds, text, and buttons
* What's the general style and layout?

# Namespacing

In the next lesson you will combine all of your team members' screens into one app. To make sure that the IDs on one page don't conflict with another you'll need to include a unique _namespace_ for your page. This will be something you add to the beginning of every id so that your element ids don't conflict with others when you merge everyone's screens together. Your namespace should be the ID of your screen with an underscore at the end. For example, if you are making the home page, you might use "home_" as your namespace - leading to ids such as:

* "home_title"
* "home_loginButton"
* "home_logo"

#### Namespacing

Ensuring that all students are both creating unique IDs for all elements and properly namespacing them will go a long way towards avoiding issues in the next lesson, so it pays to be a stickler here. You can provide students with the optional Screen Design Activity Guide to keep track of their element IDs.

#### Working together, apart

Even more so than the the paper prototyping activity, it is easy for students in this lesson to forget that they need to consider how their choices affect their team. Encourage active discussion among teams as they design screens to ensure that they are all working towards a common goal.
