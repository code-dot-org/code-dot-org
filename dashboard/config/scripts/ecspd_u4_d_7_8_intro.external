## Key Concepts

- Students will create an alphabet learning game and will use event driven programming to have a program that responds to user created events from the mouse or keyboard using the "when sprite clicked" block, "when\_key pressed" block, "switch to costume\_" block and "say\_for\_sec" block.
- Students also get to create new costumes by clicking on the Costumes Tab and downloading  their own .gif or jpg, using import or paint to make a second costume to show animation.

## Common Difficulties

This lesson was one that was presented at the in person workshop. It is a fun lesson in which students get to have the sprite respond to certain events.
<br><br>
Due to the countless ideas that can be incorporated into their program, students may try to make their program too complex and ask you to be the expert on trouble shooting their programing, so you will want to think back to some of the strategies discussed earlier that refer them to asking 3 other students before asking you, challenge them to find out and tell you the next day, etc
