<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 16px; ">In the first part of the unit, students practice using a <b>problem solving process</b> to address a series of puzzles, challenges, and real-world scenarios. Next, students learn how computers <b>input, output, store, and process (IOSP)</b> information to help humans solve problems. The unit concludes with a project in which students design an application that helps solve a problem of their choosing.

## **Students will:**
* ##### Identify the defined characteristics of a computer and how it is used to solve information problems. 
* ##### Use a structured problem solving process to address problems and design solutions that use computing technology. 
* ##### Create a collaborative classroom environment where students view computer science as relevant, fun, and empowering.



## **Implementation guidance** 
* ##### Alternate lessons are provided for some lessons in Unit 1, depending on your classroom context.

* ##### View the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MdzbIovdWzLimQZeYkWNIC614J_tshmhrKnt-7ne-48/view" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unit Guide</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sM_1Oxb7TGp5gSfuMjs0X0_Tko9tm8QJ4N6L26NI_iE/view" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guide to Implementation</a> for more information about this unit


## **Suggested time to complete the unit:** 3 weeks 
##### The suggested time is based on 225 instructional minutes per week. Visit the <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/csd1-2023" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unit Overview Page</a> and use the unit calendar to adjust the instructional minutes to reflect the time you have with your students each week.

###### <b>Heads up!</b> This unit starts with a pre-course survey. We appreciate your help in collecting crucial (and anonymous!) data about your students' beliefs and attitudes about computer science. The pre-course survey is about 30 questions long, so you may want to plan for it to be early homework or taken on an admin day before you being teaching. You can find more information about this pre-course survey in <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/csd1-2023/lessons/1" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lesson 1</a>.
