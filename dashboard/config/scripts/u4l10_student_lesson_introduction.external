# Unit 4: Lesson 1 - What is Big Data?

## Background

The explosion in computing power over the last several decades has led to a similarly astounding growth in the amount of data that is transmitted, collected, and analyzed every day. Nearly every industry and field is making use of data to better understand what is happening around them and develop new and creative solutions to the problems they face. As the scale of data gets bigger and bigger, new techniques and tools are necessary to be able to meaningfully make use of it.
