markdown <<MARKDOWN
A group of students writes their names and unique student ID numbers on sheets of paper. The sheets are then randomly placed in a stack.

Their teacher is looking to see if a specific ID number is included in the stack. Which of the following best describes whether their teacher should use a linear or a binary search?
MARKDOWN

**Explanation:** Since binary search assumes the data is sorted, linear search doesnâ€™t depend on the data being sorted since it goes through each item until the specific item is found.

Students used sticky notes to model both linear and binary search in [Lesson 2 - Algorithm Efficiency](https://studio.code.org/s/csp6-2021/lessons/2).

::: details [**Essential Knowledge Connected To This Question**]

* AAP-2.P.2:
Data must be in sorted order to use the binary search algorithm. 

* AAP-2.P.3:
Binary search is often more efficient than sequential / linear search when the data is sorted.
