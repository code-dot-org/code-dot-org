Going through the code line by line:

* An array named _data_ contains "3,5,8,2,1"
* You remove the number at index 3.
* Remember that after removing, the numbers after the removed index are shifted to the left
* Now, the array looks like: data = [3,5,2,1]
* The number at index three is now 2. Therefore, 2 is displayed
