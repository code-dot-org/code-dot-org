# Practice

#### Let’s try it out! You may have used one or more of the following LLMs already. If so, try to choose something new or try a different prompt.

#### We’ll dive into how to use these tools as an educator in a later module. For now, your primary goal should be getting an account made and getting familiar with at least one of these tools.


## Educator’s Choice

#### Choose one of the following LLMs to try.

#### A few quick notes before you get started:
* #### Bard is now Gemini! Google has rebranded their AI as Gemini. It’ll look a bit different from the videos, but it has similar functionality.
* #### Bing AI is now Copilot! (Things change quickly in the world of AI) Bing has also rebranded their AI as Copilot. It’ll also look a bit different from the videos.
* #### We’ve also given you the opportunity to try out MagicSchool AI. While not an open ended LLM like ChatGPT, it’s an AI platform for educators built on a LLM.
