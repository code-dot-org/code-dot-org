# Practice

#### Let’s try it out! You may have used one or more of the following LLMs already. If so, try to choose something new or try a different prompt.

#### We’ll dive into how to use these tools as an educator in a later module. For now, your primary goal should be getting an account made and getting familiar with at least one of these tools.


## Educator’s Choice

#### Choose one of the following LLMs to try.

<details style="background-color: #ececec; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; border: 1px solid transparent; border-radius: 5px;">
    <summary style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;">But my school/district uses another LLM...</summary>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; padding-bottom:20px;">
    <p>

#### Not a problem! The prompting practice that you develop in these activities will help you develop skills that are transferable to any LLM. Or, feel free to do these activities using the LLM your school or district uses, just know that not all LLMs have the same functionality so you may not be able to complete the activity as written.

#### A few quick notes before you get started:
* #### Bard is now Gemini! Google has rebranded their AI as Gemini. It’ll look a bit different from the videos, but it has similar functionality.
* #### Bing AI is now Copilot! (Things change quickly in the world of AI) Bing has also rebranded their AI as Copilot. It’ll also look a bit different from the videos.
* #### We’ve also given you the opportunity to try out MagicSchool AI. While not an open ended LLM like ChatGPT, it’s an AI platform for educators built on a LLM.
