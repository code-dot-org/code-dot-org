# Overview

This lesson introduces boolean values and logic, as well as conditional statements. It starts by playing a simple game of Stand Up, Sit Down where the boolean (true/false) statements are in regard to personal properties (hair or eye color, clothing type, age, etc). The focus is thinking about how you can frame a property with multiple potential values (such as age) with a binary question. You will then group objects based on increasingly complex boolean statements, including compound booleans with AND and OR. Finally, you will be introduced to conditionals as a tool to make decisions or impact the flow of a program using boolean statements as input.
