A binary message consisting of four bits was sent to you by a friend. The message was supposed to be ABAB. Unfortunately, your friend set the bit on the wire once every 2 seconds, but you read the wire once every second.  Assuming that the first bit was sent and read at the same time, what message did you receive instead?

The answer is AABB.  If person 1 is setting the wire at a rate of one bit every 2 seconds, and person 2 is reading once per second you can look at the timeline...

<pre>
person 1(set)   A---------B---------A--------B
person 2(read)  ^----^----^----^----
</pre>

You can see person 2 is going to read the wire twice while A is still on the wire.
