wrong 'The computer simulation will be able to include more details and complexity than the real-world job placement process.'
right 'The computer simulation could be used to test hypotheses about patterns in the job placement process that are costly or time consuming to observe in reality.'
wrong 'The computer simulation will be able to precisely predict the real-world outcomes for each job seeker.'
wrong 'The computer simulation will remove the bias that may arise in the real-world job placement process.'

markdown <<MARKDOWN
A job placement agency helps match job seekers with potential employers. The agency would like to design a simulation in order to help predict the likely job placement outcomes for job seekers based on historical trends and patterns. Which of the following is most likely to be a benefit of the simulation?

**Explanation:** Simulations allow us to test solutions or run experiments in a way that is usually cheaper, safer, and often times faster. Simulations are models of the real world that allow the user to investigate hypotheses and draw conclusions.

[Lesson 6 - Loops Investigate](https://studio.code.org/s/csp5-2021/lessons/6) included a discussion about the usefulness and limits of simulations. 

::: details [**Essential Knowledge Connected To This Question**]

* AAP-3.F: For simulations:
a. Explain how computers can be used to represent real-world phenomena or outcomes.
b. Compare simulations with real-world contexts.
