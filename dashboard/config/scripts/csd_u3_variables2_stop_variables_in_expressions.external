# Make a Prediction: Variables in Expressions

**What happens when we use a variable in an expression?**

	// Program 1
    var age = 12;
    console.log(age + 1);
    
	// Program 2
    var height = 10;
    var width = 5;
    console.log(width * height);
    
    // Program 3
    var ageYears = 13;
    var ageMonths = ageYears * 12;
    console.log(ageMonths);

**Once you're predicted the output of each program, discuss with a neighbor and be ready to share with the class. You'll be able to try these programs out on the next level**
