In order to manage complexity, programmers often create a function or procedure which combines several programming statements.  This is an example of what programming concept?

Learning Objective: **5.2.1** and Essential Knowledge statements: **5.2.1E**

---
(A) This choice is NOT correct.
While the code in the procedure/function can be properly referred to as an algorithm, the process of "hiding" the algorithm inside a procedure/function is abstraction.

---
(B) This IS the correct answer.  
Abstraction not only manages complexity, it facilitates more rapid code editing, and compartmentalization.

---
(C) This choice is NOT correct.
Iteration is sequential repetition.
While procedures/functions may be repeated, they themselves are not iterative. 

---
(D) This choice is NOT correct.
Scalability refers to the ease with which a process or system can sustain substantial growth
