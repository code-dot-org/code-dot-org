## Unit 3 Lesson 03 - Creativity in Algorithms

# Background
In this lesson you get more practice designing algorithms using the "Human Machine Language".  In particular you see that new problems are often easily solved by combining other algorithms that you know.  You can also optionally try your hand at actually programming in the human machine language with a widget.

# Lesson
* Introduce the 'swap' command, new to the Human Machine Language
* Design an algorithm for the "High-Low" problem
* Optionally try other algorithms
