# Creating Equitable Learning Environments > Explore Resources

Recall that equity is not the same as equality; educators who seek to create equitable learning environments need to meet individual student needs, not strive to treat everyone the same.

Next, let’s revisit the top five tips for creating a more equitable CS learning environment that we shared in the previous stage:

## Top Five Tips for Creating a More Equitable CS Learning Environment in Your Classroom

- **Reflect on your own biases and assumptions** about computer science. Ensure you are aware of the inequity you might be creating through your words and actions in the classroom. 
- **Signal an inclusive and equitable classroom environment** at all times through your actions, seating arrangements, strategic grouping choices, posters and classroom decorations, etc.
- **Facilitate conversations and activities** in which students reflect on their biases and assumptions about themselves and others as they pertain to computer science and STEM education.
- **Explicitly teach strategies** for students to employ when confronted with bias from others, both in and out of the classroom. 
- **Foster a culture of resiliency, tenacity and grit** by modeling and supporting student self-advocacy.

> Code.org has assembled [a list of resources](https://docs.google.com/a/code.org/document/d/1S7bJIAiX7BnXXIE0F-xAxDcDy6LJESjR1KFIWjXfcio/edit?usp=sharing) you can use to develop your own capacity in each of these areas. The resources are categorized by “fast and furious” resources that take only a few minutes to review and “go deeper” resources that will require more time but will provide you with a richer learning experience.
