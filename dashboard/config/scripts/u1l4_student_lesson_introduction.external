# Unit 1: Lesson 4 - Sending Binary Messages with the Internet Simulator

## Background
Now that you have learned what binary messages are, we are going to investigate how binary messages are sent over the internet. You will get to experience some of the challenges the original creators of the internet had to solve. Using the Internet Simulator you can solve the problem of how to coordinate sending messages between two devices more quickly.

## Vocabulary

* Bit Rate: The speed at which a system is able to transmit bits.

## Lesson
