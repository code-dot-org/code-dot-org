# Getting Started > Welcome!

<img src="https://code.org/images/susan-poster.png" class="level-image">

Welcome to the online portion of your Blended Summer Study for CS Principles! Here you will continue to learn from the community of teachers you started working with during your in-person workshop and spend more time with the curriculum to prepare for teaching the course in the fall. These online activities should take no more than 8 hours, and we recommend spreading that time out between now and the start of the school year. 

We recommend you have <a href = “https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit1/“ target=“_blank”>CSP unit 1</a> and any notes you took during the in-person PD open while you go through this 8-hour online PD. You may want to reference back to these materials and since we’ll be focusing here on ramping up on unit 1 and getting ready for the start of the school year,  you may want to jot down notes as you go!  

> Note: In order for the online portion of your Blended Summer Study to be considered complete, you must **finish all of the levels in this online PD by September 7th** (Labor Day)
