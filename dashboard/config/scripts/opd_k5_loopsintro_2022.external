## Course Lesson Objective

After completing Lesson 9 you will be able to:

* define loop,
* use the "repeat" block with Maze Puzzles and The Artist,  
* and create "nested" loops with Maze Puzzles and The Artist.

## CS Concepts

A **loop** is the action of doing something over and over again.

"Loops" are introduced in Courses A through D with a **context-setting** lesson in which students engage in an unplugged (off the computer) activity.

#### Lesson Plan

* Read the **context-setting** lesson <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/coursea-2022/lessons/7" target="blank">Course A - Lesson 7:  Happy Loops</a> for an example of how "loops" are first introduced to students in Course A.

**Note:** The lesson plan will open in a new window.  Be sure to return to this online course to continue with lessons.
