<h1> Communication Protocols </h1>

In order to communicate with one another, human beings have created protocols of communication. These protocols are sets of rules or guidelines that specify standard patterns used to communicate. When people share a common understanding of these patterns, they are able to communicate more effectively. 

## Communicating with Human Language
In language, these protocols consist of explicit grammatical rules (governing how words themselves and the order of words convey meaning), in addition to unwritten social understandings (how intonation like sarcasm can change the meaning of a sentence, or how to determine if a person is done speaking). These shared protocols allow people to communicate with each other clearly and effectively. When these language protocols aren’t shared or aren’t followed, a conversation can begin to break down; participants in the conversation get frustrated and information is lost in communication.

One place this can be seen is with idiomatic expressions. While intonation and grammar protocols are generally standard within a language, common expressions can vary widely across countries or regions. For non-native English speakers, an expression like “raining cats and dogs” can be confusing until it has been explained to them.

Language has enough complexity that people who have a generally shared language can usually convey their meaning without a fully explicit protocol, but machines require explicit rules for communicating. 

## Communicating with Machines and Protocols
Across history, there have been many different forms of electronic communication, dating all the way back to the electrical telegraph. The telegraph is a very simple system, consisting only of two states: on or off. In order to use the telegraph, operators needed to have a shared set of rules to assign meaning to series of signals to represent each letter in the alphabet (the protocol they developed is still used today, and is called Morse Code).  In addition to this fundamental protocol, they had a second protocol where common words and phrases could be represented by numbers, which allowed them to communicate those common phrases without having to fully spell them out every time. Between these two agreed protocols, operators were able to send complex information over a wire that could only hold two possible states. Without knowing the protocols, the series of dots and dashes would be meaningless.

Like telegraph, computers communicate via a flow of electricity. They have two possible states that they can send: on or off; and in binary one or zero. In order to use these two possible states there must be a well-defined protocol to allow us to transmit complex information from one computer to another. 
In this lesson set, students are working to build devices that can exist in two states, mimicking the states of electricity within a computer and across the internet.  What is key, is that they begin to think about protocols and ways of mapping those states to information that they care about.  Students are asked to consider how to use their message sending devices (without changing the possible states) to send a more complex message - a message with more than two possibilities.  The way that the device is used therefore becomes just as important as the device itself because it allows that communication to occur within a set of constraints that are similar to those (at the simplest level) used by a computer when sending information across the internet.
