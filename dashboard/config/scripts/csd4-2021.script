lesson_group 'csd4_1', display_name: 'Chapter 1: User Centered Design'
lesson_group_description 'This chapter introduces the design process as a specific version of the problem solving process in which empathy for a user\'s needs is consistently integrated. Students learn strategies for identifying user needs and assessing how well different designs address them. In particular they learn how to develop a paper prototype, how to gather and respond to feedback about a prototype, and consider ways different user interfaces do or do not affect the usability of their apps.'
lesson_group_big_questions '* How do designers identify the needs of their user?
* How can we ensure that a user\'s needs are met by our designs?
* What processes will best allow us to efficiently create, test, and iterate upon our designs?'

lesson_group 'csd4_2', display_name: 'Chapter 2: App Prototyping'
lesson_group_description 'This chapter is focused on a long running group project that allows students to apply all they\'ve learned about User-Centered Design to develop an app prototype.  Working in teams, students identify a social issue that they care about and design and prototype an app to address that issue.  This is an opportunity for students to explore other roles in software development, such as product management, marketing, design, and testing.'
lesson_group_big_questions '* How do teams effectively work together to develop software?
* What roles beyond programming are necessary to design and develop software?
* How do designers incorporate feedback into multiple iterations of a product?'
