* Since there are quotation marks around the numbers, str1 and str2 are set to a string with the number five inside it.
* The variable "result" wants to combine the strings (_not_ the values of the digits) which puts them next to each other and the result is now the string "55"
* The console wants to print out the value of result which is the string "55" and thus, 55 is printed out.

You can relate this to any character that is inside the string, even if it is a numerical digit. It may be easier to start out with an example that uses letters such as:

* var first = "h";
* var second = "i";
* var result = first + second
* If result were printed, "hi" would be the output

As long as the variable is of type string, combining letters and digits have the same concept.
