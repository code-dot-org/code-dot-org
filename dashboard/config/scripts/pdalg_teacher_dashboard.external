## Your Course Progress

When you click the "Your Course Progress" tile, you'll see your progress on the Code.org courses your students are using, as well as progress you've made on any PD courses you're enrolled in. This is the view that students see when they login to their accounts. As a teacher on Code.org, the main difference you'll see from the student view is that you are able to view lesson plans and see the solutions for every puzzle.

## Help and Community

When you click the "Help and Community" tile, you'll be connected to a community of engaged educators using Code.org. You'll be able to post questions, respond to other teacher's posts, and read FAQs by Code.org staff. On this page, you'll also be able to directly contact Code.org with any questions you may have.
