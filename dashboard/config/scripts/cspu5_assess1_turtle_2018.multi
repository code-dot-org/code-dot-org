What is a possible output when the following code segment executes?  The ending position of the turtle is shown in each diagram.  The starting position is shown as a white triangle in cases where the turtle starts and ends in different locations.

**Content: Unit 5 Lessons 7, 8** -- requires transfer of turtle and simple repeat loops

Going through the code line by line while keeping track of the value of "turn",

* The variable "turn" is set to 0
* The code enters a for loop that will run 4 times
* Breaking down the code within the loop, the turtle moves forward each time
* Now, if "turn" is 0 then the turtle will turnLeft and "turn" is set to 1
* However, if "turn" is not 0, the turtle will turnRight and "turn" is set back to 0
* As the loop runs 4 times and "turn" is initially set to 0 and "turn" changes between 1 and 0, the turtle will move forward, turn left, forward, turn right, forward, turn left, and forward turn right

The most important idea in this problem is the if-else statement. If a statement is true, enter the first set of code. Otherwise, execute the other piece of code.
