# Lesson 1: Introduction to Computer Vision

#### In this introductory lesson on computer vision, students explore the fundamentals of how computers interpret visual data. The lesson begins with a warm-up activity where students hypothesize algorithms to differentiate between "X" and "O". They then engage with a video that discusses the basics of machine learning and the recognition of complex shapes in computer vision.

#### The core activity, "The Search for Pixel," provides a hands-on approach to understanding image processing through a series of problem-solving rounds. By the end of the lesson, students should be able to construct a working definition of computer vision and identify its real-world applications.
