Going through the code line by line:

* The var _a_ is set to the value of 5
* The while loop will run as long as _a_ is greater or equal to three
* Inside the loop, _a_ is decreased by 1 each time
* Therefore, it will exit the loop when _a_ is 2 (less than three, does not meet the condition for the while loop)
* The value of _a_ is displayed, which equals 2
