**Explanation:** Consultation and communication with program users is an important aspect of program development. Incrementally adding tested program segments to correct working programs helps create large correct programs. Students completed interviews of classmates during [Lesson 3 - Designing an App Part 1](https://studio.code.org/s/csp3-2022/lessons/3) before designing, prototyping, or testing anything. They also observed classmates using their apps during testing in [Lesson 9 - Designing an App Part 4](https://studio.code.org/s/csp3-2022/lessons/9).
