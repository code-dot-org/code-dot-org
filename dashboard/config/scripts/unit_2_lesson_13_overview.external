# The Internet - Web Development: Lesson 13 - Website Review and Publish

## Background

After reflecting on their experience exploring digital footprints, students brainstorm a list of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that should not be included on their websites. Once they have added the list to their Web Development Practices - Project Guide, each student will use the everything in their practices packet to review their own site to make sure it meets those standards before publishing to the world for the first time!
# Vocabulary
