# More student features


### Workspace and version history

* ##### When the workspace icon appears, students' work and changes are saved between levels as they add more code.  
* ##### Students can click on the version history button and restore or view previous versions of their saved code.  
* ##### Students can also scroll down and click on the "Start Over" button to reset to the initial version of the level.  
	* Note this deletes code in the current level as well as any shared code in other levels.
