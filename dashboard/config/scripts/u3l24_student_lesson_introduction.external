## Unit 3: Lesson 24 - Chained and Nested Conditionals

# Background
To make your digital assistant respond to user input, you must evaluate keywords within the input using conditionals (also known as selection). More complex conditionals - chained and nested if-statements - will enable your digital assistant to generate unique responses to a specific set of keywords. Once your digital assistant is able to respond to multiple different inputs, you need to prove it works correctly.

# Lesson

* Add chained and nested conditionals to the digital assistant project
* Test and debug a program with logic errors
* Use boolean functions within an if statement to direct the logical flow of a program
