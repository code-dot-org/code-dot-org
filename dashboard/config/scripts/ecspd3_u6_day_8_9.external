# Unit 6 Lessons > Days 8-9 

## Concepts Covered

Mindstorms NXT software interface including common palette, complete palette, software and hardware errors, logical and syntax errors.

## Lesson Overview

In this lesson you are going to be helping students become familiar with the NXT Program interface, via the tutorials in the Robot Educator section.  You’ll help them open a new program  (User Guide pp. 48-49), use the common palette to build a small program, save the program, modify it, download it again, open a new program, switch to the complete palette, practice problem solving, make comparisons using the NXT or EV3 software and using Scratch.

> ## Hints from an ECS Teacher:
> It would be a great time to use a KWL Chart or some other guide to have students make comparisons of the software and predict how they think the LEGO Mindstorms software will work.
