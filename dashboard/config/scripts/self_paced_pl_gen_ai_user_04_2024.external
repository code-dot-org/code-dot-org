#### In this lesson, students are introduced to the **fine-tuning process** for language models, which alters the core behavior of a chatbot. They begin by reflecting on how inside jokes or slang create connections that are hard to explain to outsiders, then explore a medical expert chatbot fine-tuned with additional medical data. Students also explore other fine-tuned models to see how different data sources impact chatbot responses.

## Up Next!
#### Learn more about comparing models and try it out in chatbot lab.
