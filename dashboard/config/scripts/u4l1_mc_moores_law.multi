Moore's Law is discussed at length in the lesson plan as a lead-in to the "Big Data Sleuth" activity.

**Moore's Law** - a predication made by Gordon Moore in 1965 that computing power will double every 1.5-2 years, it has remained more or less true ever since.

For purposes of the AP exam a looser definition is supported - **Moore's Law**: the observation that computing power roughly doubles every two years.
