In the initial app, the inputs are the weather report and the planned activities for the day.

For the improved app, there is no "correct" answer, and students may choose to make any reasonable improvement.  For example, the app may remind the user to take a change of clothes for an activity later in the day.  The app could also take into account holidays, or school dress code requirements.
