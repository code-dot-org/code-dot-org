# Unit 5: Lesson 12 - Loops and Simulations

## Background

We can often develop intuitions for patterns by performing real-life experiments at a small scale, but verifying our intuitions with larger experiments can prove prohibitively time-consuming, costly, or even dangerous. If we can develop a model or simulation of the phenomenon we wish to investigate, we can confirm our hypotheses much more quickly without the risks or costs associated with a real-life experiment.

## Vocabulary

**Models and Simulations:** a program which replicates or mimics key features of a real world event in order to investigate its behavior without the cost, time, or danger of running an experiment in real life.

## Lesson

* Calculate statistics from a coin flipping experiment.
* Create a simulation to repeat this experiment for much larger inputs.
* Create updated hypotheses based on the results of simulations.

## Resources

* Activity Guide: Flipping Coins ([PDF](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xLzpruWj1foU23cVDGAcq7WoH_QCvAbSGpT-QT5tp0s/export?format=pdf) | [DOCX](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xLzpruWj1foU23cVDGAcq7WoH_QCvAbSGpT-QT5tp0s/export?format=doc))

The series of problems and tasks in this lesson progressively build up a series of experiments that simulate coin flipping.

We ask students to **make a hypothesis**, then experiment with code, revise the hypothesis and so on, around some question.  Below are some guidelines about what students should find.

**Insights: **The following insights should arise from this experiment:
    
* **Total Heads:** When trying to flip 5 heads, it is quite possible that it will only take 5 flips, but it may also easily take 15 or 20. Relative to the number of heads you are looking for, this is a massive range! When you are trying to flip 10,000 heads the likely range is typically between 19,000 and 21,000, and typically much closer. As you are looking for more flips, the relative width of the likely window shrinks.
    
* **Longest Streak:** When trying to find a streak of 3 heads it will typically take between 3 (it’s always possible!) and 20 flips, though of course it may take longer. Even slightly longer streaks of heads, however, will rapidly increase the average time it takes to find that streak. Looking for a streak of 12 heads might occasionally happen in fewer than 100 flips, but it can also easily take tens of thousands. As the length of the streak increases, the number of flips it takes to find that streak grows rapidly. 
    
**How Much Math is Necessary?** 

This lesson might seem to naturally lend itself to a more detailed discussion of the mathematical properties of random experiments. Flipping coins is, after all, perhaps the most classic example of a random experiment. 
    
The goal of this lesson **is not** for students to walk away knowing the precise mathematical relationship between the number of coins flipped and the number of heads observed or the longest streak of heads. Instead they are supposed to **appreciate that questions that might be impossible or hard to address by hand are possible to examine by using computer simulation**. Just as developing a mathematical model is one way to address a problem, so too is developing a simulation. 
    
**There’s no need to dive deep into the mathematics** this lesson touches on, but students should be able to describe the patterns they observed while running their simulations, and use those observations to justify new hypotheses.
