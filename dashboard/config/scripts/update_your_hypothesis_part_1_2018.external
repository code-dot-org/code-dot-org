# Updating Your Hypotheses

If everything has gone well **you should already be able to make a determination about your first hypothesis**. 

* How close were your guesses on the **high and low bounds for the number of flips to get 10,000 heads?**
* Were you at all surprised by this result? If they were different from what you predicted why might this be the case?

<br>
Take some time to write out your thoughts and whether your understanding of this system has changed. **Update either of your hypotheses to reflect what you observed in this first experiment**.
