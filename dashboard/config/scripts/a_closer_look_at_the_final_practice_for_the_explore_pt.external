# A Closer look at the Final Practice for the Explore PT


In order to support students in preparation for the Explore PT, we have created a practice PT at the end of unit 4 titled *Big Data and Cybersecurity Dilemmas*. This resource serves as a guide for understanding how the PT and practice PT relate and is broken down by key element of the PT.


Below is an overview of the LOs assessed in the Explore PT as documented in the CSP Framework.  The College Board formally assesses the Computational Artifact (CA) and Written Responses (WR).  Additionally, this table has been extended to includes explanation of how the LOs are addressed in the practice PT.

## Computing Innovation

In the Explore PT, students begin by choosing an innovation that fits the following requirement:


> Investigate a computing innovation that has had or has the potential to have significant beneficial and harmful effects on society, economy, or culture; consumes, produces, and/or transforms data; and raises at least one data storage concern, data privacy concern, or data security concern.

(CSP Framework p. 75)


They then explain its positive and negative impacts on the world and create a computational artifact to help explain their chosen innovation.  The Practice PT supports students in analyzing the beneficial and harmful effects of an innovation, but differs from the actual PT in two ways:


1. Rather than asking students to select an innovation, we are asking students to focus on a dilemma that exists in the world.  They must then find a specific issue or event within that topic, and define the computing innovation that could be considered the root of the issue.  We do this to help students consider what sorts of things can be considered “computing innovations”. Many students likely have a good idea of how computing is impacting their lives or the lives of people through the media.  At the beginning of this project, however, we do not expect that they are able to articulate what the computing innovation is without researching their subject and learning a little more about the technical aspects of the issue.  Choosing a computing innovation to research for the Explore PT may sound daunting for students, but is doable, especially when using this technique of starting with a big issue that’s been in the news, and working backwards from there to determine the underlying computing innovation. 
2. This practice PT is the summative artifact for Unit 4.  We have limited students to two possible categories to make sure they are demonstrating their understanding of material learned within this unit.


## Computational Artifacts

A large portion of the Explore PT is the computational artifact.  Students must design their own computational artifact that supports the viewer’s understanding of the chosen computing innovation.  For this practice PT, we simply do not have enough time to create a computational artifact.  It is important, however, to take time to consider what makes a good artifact.  For this reason, we ask students to search for some form of visual or audio artifact that already fulfills the intent of a computational artifact.  Students must then justify their choice, explaining what makes the artifact effective.  To help students identify these traits, you should consider the Task Guidelines provided by the college board:

<blockquote>
<p>
Students will produce a computational artifact that illustrates, represents, or explains the computing innovation’s intended purpose, its function, or its effect, and provide written responses to each of the given prompts.
There are a number of widely available computational tools students can use to create computational artifacts for this task. A computational artifact is a visualization, a graphic, a video, a program, or an audio recording that students create using a computer. The students’ creations could solve a problem, show creative expression, or provide the viewer with new insight or knowledge.
Effective artifacts include:
</p><ul style = "list-style-type:none">

<li>  &#9654; visual, graphical, and/or audio content to help a reader understand the purpose of a computing innovation; and</li>
<li> &#9654; the use of communications media, such as animations, comic strips, infographics, and/ or public service announcements, to illustrate the purpose of a computing innovation.
Ineffective artifacts include:	</li>
<ul style = "list-style-type:none">
<li>  &#9658; artifacts that repeat information supplied in the written responses;	</li>
<li> &#9658; multislide presentations with paragraphs of text or bullets; and	</li>
<li> &#9658; artifacts that have not been created by the student.  </li>
</ul>
</ul>

## Audience

As students practice writing for a performance task, it is important to consider the audience they are writing to.  Simply put, they should be writing to an average person.  If they use technical vocabulary, they should explain what they mean rather than assuming the person reading understands. (This helps demonstrate their own understanding to an AP reader.)  This is reiterated in the Rubric in the row titled ‘Explaining the Computing Innovation”


## Sources and Citations

It is critical that students are able to choose appropriate sources for the Explore PT.  In fact, selection of and citation of evidence is in the rubric and can be a simple way for students to earn points.  While the practice PT does not have any guidelines about what sorts of resources should be selected, it has been scaffolded to support students as they try to determine how to go about finding sources and what information may be relevant. (Though you may choose to add constraints for your own class.)  We suggest having a discussion with your students about what makes a source credible.  After students have submitted this project, taking a quick glance through their reference citations will help determine whether they are able to select appropriate sources or if they may need additional practice in this area.


## Rubric


The rubric for the practice PT was created with the intention of mirroring the Explore PT rubric, using language directly from the PT rubric wherever applicable.  This will allow teachers to give feedback to their students, helping them practice and improve the same skills they will need for the actual PT.  A note: Do be cautious… although the rubrics are similar, you have not calibrated your grading expectations with college board and thus students who receive a certain grade on this project cannot expect to receive the same marks on the actual performance task.
