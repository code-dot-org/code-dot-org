**Content: Unit 5 Lesson 6**

To format content inside a string in JavaScript, there are set letters that follows a backslash that denotes what the programmer wants the string to look like. In this case, \\n means go print this in the next line. 

Below is a key that states the other possibilities that are not correct to this particular question:

* \\t - horizontally tabs the string at the given place (not covered in lessons)
