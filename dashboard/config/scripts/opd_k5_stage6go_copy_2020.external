# Unplugged Lesson: Songwriting

> A **function** is a piece of code that you can easily call over and over again.

Programmers are always looking for ways to make their code more efficient. One way that they do that is through **functions**, which allow them to reuse segments of code.

*** 

## **1. Review "<a href="https://curriculum.code.org/csf-20/coursee/14/" target="blank">Functions: Songwriting</a>" Lesson Plan from Course E.**
<br/>
Course E is meant for students in Grade 4. Functions are not covered in Courses A-D. 

## **2. Watch the student video: "Functions: Songwriting" (found in the lesson plan)**
This is a video that you would show your students to help introduce the concept of functions and kick off the unplugged lesson.  

## **3. Watch a teacher model this lesson: "Functions: Songwriting" (found in the lesson plan)**
This video is meant to be support for you as the teacher, if you are looking for tips on how to run this lesson.
