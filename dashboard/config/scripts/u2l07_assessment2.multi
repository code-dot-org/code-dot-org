question 'Which of the following statements is FALSE about minimum spanning trees (from the previous lesson) and shortest path trees:'
wrong 'The minimum spanning tree algorithm you learned does not necessarily need to try every edge.'
wrong 'A minimum spanning tree contains the shortest path between the starting vertex and every other reachable vertex in the graph.'
right 'The shortest path algorithm you learned visits each vertex and edge once.'
wrong 'Both the minimum spanning tree algorithm you learned and the
shortest path algorithm you learned used a “greedy” approach,
choosing the smallest edge first or vertex with the smallest distance value first.'
