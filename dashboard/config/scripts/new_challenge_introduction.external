### New Challenge: Crack a Random Substitution Cipher...with a new widget

What if instead of shifting the whole alphabet, we mapped every letter of the alphabet to a random different letter of the alphabet? This is called a **random substitution cipher.**

Now, instead of the secret message being encoded with a simple alphabetic shift, you'll face messages encoded with **random substitution**.  



This is much harder to crack and requires a more sophisticated tool, so...

When you click continue, you'll see a **new, more sophisticated version of the encryption tool** that shows you lots of different stuff.

But what it does is bit of a mystery!  

### Your Task:

 * Figure out what is going on in this new version of the tool
 * What information is being presented to you?
 * Figure out what the the tool let's you do
 * As usual: you can't break it.  So click on things, poke around.
 * If you figure it out you might be able to crack a message encoded with random substitution.
 
### Hint

* Did you know that **E** is the most common letter used in English?

### Reconvene and Discuss
 After some time playing with it, you should get together with someone - partner, small group, whole class - to discuss what you found and verify that you know what's going on and the various ways you can use the tool.
