In the following code segment, assume that the `ArrayList` `wordList` has been initialized to contain the elements `["apple", "banana", "coconut", "lemon", "orange", "pear"]`.

```
int count = 0;
for (String word : wordList) {
  if (word.indexOf("a") >= 0) {
    count++;
  }
}

System.out.println(count);
```
