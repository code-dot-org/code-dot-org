# Check for Understanding

## Answer: B

#### While there might not be a single "correct" answer, as teaching strategies can vary based on context and educational goals, option B) Correct and Explain is generally the most educational and proactive approach. It allows the teacher to address the error head-on, correct the misinformation, and turn the situation into a valuable teaching moment about the importance of critical thinking and the limitations of AI. Option C) Student Investigation also presents a constructive approach by engaging students directly in the learning and correction process.
