**Content: Unit 5 Lesson 5** - application of local v. global

Going through each line of code:

* 1: A variable x is set to the value 10
* 2: The function "increase()" is called where a separate local variable that is also named "x" is set to the value 5
* 3: Exiting the function "increase()", in line 3 the value of x is still 10 because the local variable inside "increase()" is not accessible outside outside the function. Thus, in line 3, x = x + 3 which equals 10 + 3 = 13
* Printing the value of x, the computer outputs "13"
