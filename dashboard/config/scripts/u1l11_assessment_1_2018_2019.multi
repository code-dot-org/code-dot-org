### How many bits?

ASCII has an encoding for every character of the alphabet as well as encodings for numbers -- that is, encodings for the symbols of the digits 0-9.  So here is a trick question: How many bits are required to store the *text* of the number "150" in ASCII?'

**Answer**

The answer is 24 because the ASCII text "150" is just 3 ASCII characters - same as any other 3-character text, "ABC", "DOG", whatever.  And in ASCII every character is encoded as one byte which is 8 bits, and `8 * 3 = 24`.
