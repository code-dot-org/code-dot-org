question 'You have a coordinate grid that is 96 x 96. Assuming that you encode the x and y coordinate as separate numbers, what is the minimum number of  bits that you will need to encode a coordinate in that space?'
wrong '16'
right '14'
wrong '13'
wrong '10'

14 bits because you need 7 bits each for the x and y coordinates.  7 bits lets you encode 128 different numbers (0-127) so that is enough to span a 96 cell grid.  6 bits each would only let you encode 64 different numbers.
