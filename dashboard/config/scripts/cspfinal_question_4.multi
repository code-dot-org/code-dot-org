**Question:**

Computer `A` is sending a series of packets to Computer `C`. Due to increased traffic on the network, the cost of the direct connection between `A` and `C` is slowly increasing. How much would the cost of the direct `A-to-C` connection need to increase to make it potentially faster to route through Computer `B`?
