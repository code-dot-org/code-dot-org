Learning Objective: **2.1.1** and Essential Knowledge statements: **2.1.1E**
<hr>
 (A) From the new length of 8 bits, we realize that the barcode length increased by 1 bit. With one extra bit, the barcode can represent two times as many possible unique identifiers. 

<hr>
 (B) From the new length of 8 bits, we realize that the barcode length increased by 1 bit. With one extra bit, the barcode can represent two times as many possible unique identifiers. 

<hr>
 (C) The length increased by 1 bit. With one extra bit, the barcode can represent two times as many possible unique identifiers. 

<hr>
 (D) With one extra bit, the barcode can represent two times as many possible unique identifiers. This stems from the fact that binary is base 2 (whereas decimal is base 10).
