##### Although the curriculum does provide guidance on opportunities to assess whether or not a student has met a specific learning objective, it is up to the teacher to:

* ##### Determine the appropriateness of the assessments for their students. 
* ##### Decide how to use, or not use, the suggested assessments for grading purposes. 

## Consider the following:

* ##### What do I believe about the purpose of assessment and the relationship between assessment and grading? 
* ##### What does my school require of me regarding assessment of student learning and grading? 
* ##### What tools are available within the curriculum to support me in assessing student learning?
* ##### How will I assess student learning while implementing a lesson with students?
* ##### How will I assess student learning at the end of a chapter or unit?
