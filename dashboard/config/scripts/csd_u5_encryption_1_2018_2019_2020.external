MARKDOWN

The message itself is a doughnut, thumbs down, and angry face.  Students may have fun coming up with their own interpretations of the emojis.  One possible interpretation is that the sender expected a doughnut, didn't get one and became angry, but there is no "right" answer to what the emojis mean.
    
(Hide this message by going to your teacher panel on the right and choosing to view as a student.)
