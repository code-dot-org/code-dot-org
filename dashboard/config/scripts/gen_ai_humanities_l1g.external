## Email Draft

**Task:** Draft a formal email to a teacher requesting an extension on a project deadline.

### Steps

1. **Understanding the task:** You will be crafting a prompt that asks an AI tool to draft a formal email to a teacher requesting an extension on a project deadline.

   Think about what makes a good formal email: it should be clear, polite, and provide enough context for the request.

2. **Crafting your prompt:** Start by considering the key points the email should include. This might involve stating the reason for the extension request, providing any relevant details about the project, and expressing gratitude.

   Think about how to phrase your prompt to ensure the AI provides a well-structured and polite email.

3. **Writing your prompt:** Write a prompt that is clear and specific. Here is an example to get you started:

> Draft a formal email to a teacher requesting an extension on a project deadline. Include a polite greeting, a clear explanation for the request, details about the project, and a courteous closing.

4. **Using the AI tool:** Enter your prompt into the AI tool, and review the response. Assess whether it meets your expectations and includes a clear, polite, and well-structured email.

5. **Evaluate the response:** Consider the following questions when evaluating the AI's response:

   * Does the email include a polite greeting and closing?
   
   * Is the reason for the extension request clearly explained?
   
   * Are the details about the project and the request appropriate and respectful?
   
   * Is the overall tone of the email polite and professional?

6. **Refining your prompt:** If the AI's response is not as expected, think about how you can improve your prompt. You might need to add more detail or be more specific about what you want.

   Adjust your prompt and try again until you get a satisfactory response.
