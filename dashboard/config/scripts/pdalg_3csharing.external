# Sharing Student Work > Finding Projects to Share

## Things that can be shared

Many of the activites that students complete are intented as skill-building puzzles, and not designed for sharing broadly. To identify "shareable" programs you'll want to look in a couple of places:

* The Big Game (which can be shared from any Big Game level)
* The Free Play puzzles that show up at the end of most stages
* Mini projects like Rocket Height, Sam the Bat, and Luigi's Pizza
* Anything the students have done in the standalone freeplay apps

## What makes a good artifact to share

Though it's tempting to focus only on the most impressive programs that your students have made, consider also looking for the following when identifying artifacts to share:

* A program that was a major breakthrough for a struggling student
* A problem that was solved in a unique way
* Thourough use of examples that cover all potential inputs
* Free play programs based on your own curriculum
* Particularly effective use of the contract and purpose statement

## Getting a shareable link

To share out your student artifacts, you'll need to grab a shareable link. Programs that can be shared will have a **Share** button in the header that you can use to get the link

Click the “Continue” button below once you have gathered at least 3-5 student artifacts.
