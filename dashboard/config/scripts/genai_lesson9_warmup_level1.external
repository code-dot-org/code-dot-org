#Warm Up

#### We're going to play a game called **Fortunately, Unfortunately**. Here's how it works:

#### 1) We start with a simple sentence. For example: "Steve needed to go to the store to get some apples"

#### 2) The next person continues the story with a generally positive sentence that starts with "Fortunately: ..."

#### 3) The next person continues the sentence with a generally negative sentence that starts with "Unfortunately: ..."

#### 4) Repeat five or six times, then pick a new starting sentence
