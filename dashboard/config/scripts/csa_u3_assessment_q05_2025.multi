teacher_markdown <<MARKDOWN
When a 1D array is declared and initialized using the `new` keyword, the elements are initialized to the default value for the specified data type. Since this 1D array is a `double`, the elements are initialized to `0.0`. The only element that is then changed is the value assigned at index `0`, or the first position in `numArray`. The other values in `numArray` are still `0.0`.
