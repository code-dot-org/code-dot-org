Consider the following code segment.

```
int sum = numbers[0];
int index = 0;

while (index < numbers.length) {
  index += 1;
  sum += numbers[index];
}
```

Which of the following will be the result of executing this code segment?
MARKDOWN

teacher_markdown <<MARKDOWN
A runtime error will occur because the value of `index` is increased by `1` **before** the variable is used to access the value. This means that when `index` reaches the last index and the condition is `true`, the value of `index` is then increased to one more than the last index. This would then be an invalid index in the 1D array `numbers`.
