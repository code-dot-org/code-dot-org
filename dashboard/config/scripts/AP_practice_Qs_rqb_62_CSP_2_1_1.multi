Learning Objective: **2.1.1** and Essential Knowledge statements: **2.1.1F**
<hr>
 (A) All programming languages can interpret all numeric representations, as long as the format is indicated within the program.

<hr>
 (B) Hexadecimal format can represent every byte (i.e., eight bits) as two consecutive hexadecimal digits, since it uses alphanumeric characters 0-9 and A-F, instead of the eight digits that would be required by Binary.  Fewer digits means less storage space required.

<hr>
 (C) Compilers will actually transform all numeric values to Binary to make them readable by the CPU.

<hr>
 (D) All numeric values can be represented in Binary, but very large numbers will require very many digits.
