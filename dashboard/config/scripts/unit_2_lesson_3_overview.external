# The Internet - Web Development: Lesson 3 - Describing Web Pages

## Background

Students will invent their own language that attempts to describe the structure and content of simple web pages. Through this process, they explore the difficulties of creating a language that describes both of these features at the level of specificity required for a computer to understand. Students will come up with many different ideas of languages, leading to a discussion about why everyone who builds a web page needs to use the same set of rules.
