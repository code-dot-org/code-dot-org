## Why should you teach CS Discoveries?

* ##### **Engaging Curriculum:** Our team designed the CS Discoveries curriculum to support students and teachers new to the discipline. The curriculum includes daily lesson plans made up of inquiry-based activities, videos, assessments, and computing tools, allowing teachers to guide and learn alongside students as they discover core computing concepts throughout the course.

* ##### **A Focus on Emerging Technologies:** The CS Discoveries curriculum features a unit on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). As these technologies touch more and more of our daily lives, they have become an essential part of foundational computer science education. The unit focuses on AI ethics, examines issues of bias, and explores and explains fundamental concepts through a number of online and offline activities and full-group discussions.

* ##### **Extensive Teacher Resources:** The CS Discoveries curriculum includes daily lesson plans along with integrated discussion goals, teaching tips, and assessment opportunities, our lesson plans come with detailed pacing instructions, activity guides, exemplar projects, sample marked rubrics, and more! Teachers are also able to create and manage classroom sections, check student progress, administer assessments, and integrate with Google or Clever classroom, all from a Teacher Dashboard!

> ##**Curriculum Value:** Computer Science is Foundational for Every Student
We believe that computing is so fundamental to understanding and participating in society that it is **valuable for every student to learn as part of a modern education.** We see computer science as a liberal art, a subject that provides students with a critical lens for interpreting the world around them. **Computer science prepares all students to be active and informed contributors to our increasingly technological society whether they pursue careers in technology or not.** Computer science can be life-changing, not just skill training.
