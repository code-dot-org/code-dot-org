markdown <<MARKDOWN
A restaurant knows from historical data that 60 out of 100 of its customers purchase a full meal while 40 out of 100 only order a side dish. The program below is intended to simulate the orders of 1000 customers.

```
fullMeal ← 0
sideDish ← 0
REPEAT 1000 TIMES
{
	IF (<MISSING CODE>)
	{
		fullMeal ← fullMeal + 1
	}
	ELSE
	{
		sideDish ← sideDish + 1
	}
}
DISPLAY (fullMeal)
DISPLAY ("full meals were ordered,")
DISPLAY (sideDish)
DISPLAY ("side dishes were ordered.")
```

Which of the following can be used to replace `<MISSING CODE>` so that the simulation works as intended?

**Explanation:** Since the value stored in `fullMeal` will be increased by 1 when this statement evaluates to true, it should evaluate to true 60 out of 100 times. Since a number chosen at random between 1 and 100 will be less than or equal to 60, 60 out of every 100 times, this expression can be used to make the simulation work as intended.

Students practiced writing their own simulation program for rolling a dice in [Lesson 7 - Loops Practice](https://studio.code.org/s/csp5-2021/lessons/7).
