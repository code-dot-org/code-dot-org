# Additional ways to support student learning needs

## Can I print support resources for students who need paper copies of reference material? 

##### Yes, the text resources found in the "Help and Tips" tab of Code Studio are listed as resources in the "For the teachers" section of the teacher lesson plans. The resources are listed in the lesson plan where the concept is first introduced. Teachers can print these resources for students. Since these resources will be referenced throughout the unit, students may benefit from using a three pronged folder or binder to store their printed reference materials.

## Can my students who are learning to read have their lesson instructions read aloud? 

##### Yes, many lessons in Code.org's courses offer a read-aloud option for students. We recommend introducing all  students to the read aloud feature as it can help students learning to read; students learning a second (or third!) language; and/or students who process information in different ways. <a href="https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/360058843692-Can-my-students-who-are-learning-to-read-have-their-lesson-instructions-read-aloud-" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here</a> to learn more about read-aloud options.

## Do videos within the curriculum support closed captioning?
