## Unit 3: Lesson 15 - More Variables

# Background

Variable assignment and arithmetic are different than what you experience in math class. The word “gets” illustrates this difference in what appears to be an equation such as X = 6. Think of this as "X GETS 6" and you won’t get confused. Storing and manipulating information with variable arithmetic and reassignment is critical to creating useful applications.
