**Symmetric Encryption:** A scheme in which the key to encrypt data is the same as the key to decrypt.

**Asymmetric Encryption:** Used in public key encryption, it is a scheme in which the key to encrypt data is _different_ from the key to decrypt.

**Public Key:** This is used prevalently on the web, it allows for secure messages to be sent between parties without having to agree on, or share, a secret key. It uses an asymmetric encryption scheme in which the encryption key is made public, but the decryption key is kept private.

**SSL:** (Secure Sockets Layer) is the standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and a browser. This link ensures that all data passed between the web server and browsers remain private and integral.
