A summer camp offers a morning session and an afternoon session. The list `morningList` contains the names of all children attending the morning session, and the list `afternoonList` contains the names of all children attending the afternoon session.

Only children who attend both sessions eat lunch at the camp. The camp director wants to create `lunchList`, which will contain the names of children attending both sessions.

The following code segment is intended to create `lunchList`, which is initially empty. It uses the procedure `IsFound (list, name)`, which returns `true` if `name` is found in `list` and returns `false` otherwise.

<pre>
FOR EACH child IN morningList
{
    <MISSING CODE>
}
</pre>

Which of the following could replace `<MISSING CODE>` so that the code segment works as intended?
