# Introduction to Equity > Why does equity matter for CS education?

Watch this brief video to reflect on the role of equity in CS education:

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/108690109" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> <p><a href="https://vimeo.com/108690109">Inequity in Computer Science Education</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user8141055">Bryan Twarek</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

Unfortunately, not all CS learning spaces are inclusive or equitable, for many reasons:

- There are many assumptions about who can and should learn CS, so CS classrooms [are not as diverse](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/teaching-coding-kids-key-closing-fields-diversity-gap/) as they can be. 
- Not all educators are [skilled](http://math.coe.uga.edu/tme/monograph1/mono1_Reed.pdf) at facilitating an equitable learning environment, and teachers can often perpetuate assumptions and biases that students and parents bring into the school. 

This inequity has led to a shocking trend in the CS industry: [a well-documented dearth of women and people of color in the professional workplace](https://code.org/about).
