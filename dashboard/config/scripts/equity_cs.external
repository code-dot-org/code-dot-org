### Introduction to Equity > Why does equity matter for CS education?
<br><br>
Watch this brief video to reflect on the role of equity in CS education:

<br><br>
Unfortunately, not all CS learning spaces are inclusive or equitable, for many reasons:


- There are many assumptions about who can and should learn CS, so CS classrooms [are not as diverse](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/teaching-coding-kids-key-closing-fields-diversity-gap/) as they can be. 
- Not all educators are [skilled](http://math.coe.uga.edu/tme/monograph1/mono1_Reed.pdf) at facilitating an equitable learning environment, and teachers can often perpetuate assumptions and biases that students and parents bring into the school. 

This inequity has led to a shocking trend in the CS industry: [a well-documented dearth of women and people of color in the professional workplace](https://code.org/about).
