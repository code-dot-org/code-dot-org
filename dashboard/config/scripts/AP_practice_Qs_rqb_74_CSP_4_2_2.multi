Learning Objective: **4.2.2** and Essential Knowledge statements: **4.2.2D**
<hr>
 (A) <strong>This answer choice is incorrect.</strong> Algorithms are developed to understand, develop solutions, and solve well-defined computational problems.

<hr>
 (B) <strong>This answer choice is incorrect.</strong> Not every problem can be solved using an algorithm; such problems may require a heuristic to find an approximate solution.

<hr>
 (C) <strong>This answer choice is incorrect.</strong> Heuristics may be helpful in finding the approximate solution more quickly when algorithms cannot find an exact solution.

<hr>
 (D) <strong>This answer choice is correct.</strong> Given a problem, there could be more than one algorithm that could solve it.
