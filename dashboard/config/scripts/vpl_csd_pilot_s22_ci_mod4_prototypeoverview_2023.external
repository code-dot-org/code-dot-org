## Key Vocabulary

* ##### **Prototype** - A first or early model of a product that allows you to test assumptions before developing a final version.
* ##### **User Interface** - The visual elements of a program through which a user controls or communicates with the application. Often abbreviated UI.

## Prototype Testing Activity

##### In Lesson 5, students will work with a partner to test out a paper prototype for the "Txt Ur Grndkdz" app. One student will play the role of the User, interacting with the User Interface screens as if itâ€™s an actual app. The other student (the Computer) will take care of making sure the prototype responds as it was designed. 

##### **Students will:**
* ##### Collect and analyze feedback from user testing with a paper prototype.
* ##### Use a paper prototype to test the design of an app.

## Let's explore the activity!
