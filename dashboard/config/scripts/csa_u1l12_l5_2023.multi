Where will the `Painter` be located after this code segment executes?

```
Painter nadine = new Painter();

if (nadine.canMove()) {
  nadine.move();
  nadine.turnLeft();
}
else {
  nadine.turnLeft();
}
```

teacher_markdown <<MARKDOWN
When this code segment executes, the condition for the `if` statement is `true` because `canMove()` returns `true` (the `Painter` object can move forward in the direction it is currently facing). The `Painter` object will then move forward one space then turn left. The `else` branch will not execute since the condition for the `if` statement was `true`.
