Congratulations, by this point, you have nearly completed all of Phase 2!

As you head in to Phase 3, remember that Code.org will continue to be available as you proceed through the steps necessary to get your classroom going in the year to come.

For simple questions, be sure to check <a href="https://support.code.org" target="_new">support.code.org</a> for answers.  

For more unique questions, post a message in the <a href="http://forum.code.org/c/cs-in-science" target="_new">forums</a> or pose it on <a href="https://twitter.com/teachcodeorg" target="_new">Twitter with the @teachCodeorg handle</a>. Both of these methods reach beyond your community to solicit help from others who may have implemented these lessons before.
