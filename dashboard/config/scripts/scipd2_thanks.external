Congratulations, by this point, you have nearly completed all of Phase 2!

As you head in to Phase 3, remember that Project GUTS is here to help you proceed through the steps necessary to get your classroom going in the year to come.

For simple questions, be sure to check <a href="https://support.code.org" target="_new">support.code.org archives</a> for answers.  

For more specific programming and debugging questions, post a message in the <a href="https://teacherswithguts.org/discussions/programming-and-debugging-questions" target="_new">programming and debugging forum</a> or if you have a request, pose it on <a href="https://teacherswithguts.org/discussions/requests" target="_new">requests forum</a>. Both of these methods reach beyond your community to solicit help from others who may have implemented these lessons before.

For all other issues, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@projectguts.org">info@projectguts.org</a> and someone from our small team will get back to you as soon as we are able.
