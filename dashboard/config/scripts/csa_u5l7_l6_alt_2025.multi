Consider the following code segment.

```
String[][] textArray = {
    {"apple", "banana", "cherry"},
    {"orange", "grape", "kiwi"},
    {"mango", "blueberry", "pineapple"}
};

String target = "a";

int totalCount = 0;

for (String[] row : textArray) {
    for (String text : row) {
        int index = text.indexOf(target);
        while (index != -1) {
            totalCount++;
            index = text.substring(index + 1).indexOf(target);
            if (index != -1) {
                index += target.length();
            }
        }
    }
}

System.out.println(totalCount);
```

Which of the following best describes the purpose of this code segment?

teacher_markdown <<MARKDOWN
For each `String`, the code checks the index of the target character `"a"` using `indexOf()`. If the target character is found (index is not `-1`), it increments the `totalCount` variable. Then, the code takes the substring starting from the next character after the found target character and checks again for the target character's index. This process continues until the target character is not found in the substring, which means the loop has checked all occurrences of the target character in the current `String`.

Once all the `String`s have been processed, the `totalCount` variable holds the total occurrences of the target character `"a"` in all the `String`s present in the `textArray`. The code then prints this count.
