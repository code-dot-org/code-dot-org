# Wrap up

This marks the end of Module 7!  As a reminder, students will go through a similar project planning structure with Unit 8â€™s project.  The skills students build in Unit 7 will help them be successful in Unit 8 as well. 
In your next Code.org workshop, we will look at Unit 8 and make a plan for the end of the year.


**See you soon!**
