## Research Summary

**Task:** Summarize the key findings of a recent study on the effects of screen time on children.

### Steps

1. **Understanding the task:** You will be crafting a prompt that asks an AI tool to summarize the key findings of a recent study on the effects of screen time on children.

   Think about what makes a good summary: it should be concise, include the main findings, and be relevant to the topic.

2. **Crafting your prompt:** Start by considering the key points you want the summary to include. This might involve the study's objectives, methods, key results, and conclusions about the effects of screen time on children.

   Think about how to phrase your prompt to ensure the AI provides a concise and relevant summary.

3. **Writing your prompt:** Write a prompt that is clear and specific. Here is an example to get you started:

> Summarize the key findings of a recent study on the effects of screen time on children. Include the study's objectives, methods, key results, and conclusions. Ensure the summary is concise and relevant.

4. **Using the AI tool:** Enter your prompt into the AI tool, and review the response. Assess whether it meets your expectations and includes a concise and relevant summary of the study.

5. **Evaluate the response:** Consider the following questions when evaluating the AI's response:

   * Does the summary include the study's objectives, methods, key results, and conclusions?
   
   * Is the summary concise and easy to understand?
   
   * Does the summary focus on the most important and relevant information?

6. **Refining your prompt:** If the AI's response is not as expected, think about how you can improve your prompt. You might need to add more detail or be more specific about what you want.

   Adjust your prompt and try again until you get a satisfactory response.
