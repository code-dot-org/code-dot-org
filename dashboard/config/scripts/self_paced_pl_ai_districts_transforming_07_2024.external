# Education Specific AI Tools

#### Educational technology companies have taken to developing education-specific tools to support educators in their roles. These tools are not only more specialized but often have additional features such as:
* #### Guardrails in place for what you can and cannot prompt about
* #### Stricter privacy policies that may be more appropriate for school settings
* #### Prompting input and output designed specifically for educator tasks
