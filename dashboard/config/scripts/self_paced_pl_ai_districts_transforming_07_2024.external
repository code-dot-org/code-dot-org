# Education Specific Tools

#### LLMs serve as general-purpose AI systems capable of understanding and generating human-like text based on the input they receive. They are designed to be highly versatile, handling a broad range of tasks from writing and summarizing to answering questions across various domains. While interacting directly with an LLM is a key component of AI literacy it’s not always the best tool for the job.

#### Developers have built tools on LLM technology that are often more specialized applications that leverage the underlying capabilities of LLMs but are tailored for specific functions. For example, a customer service chatbot powered by an LLM might only handle inquiries related to billing and technical support, using the LLM’s broad language capabilities in a narrow, focused context. This specialization allows these tools to provide more targeted and efficient solutions in their respective areas, often with additional modifications or training to suit particular needs.

#### Educational technology companies have taken to developing education-specific tools to support educators in their roles. These tools are not only more specialized but often have additional features such as:
* #### Guardrails in place for what you can and cannot prompt about
* #### Stricter privacy policies that may be more appropriate for school settings
* #### Prompting input and output designed specifically for educator tasks

#### You will explore some of these tools in the next level.
