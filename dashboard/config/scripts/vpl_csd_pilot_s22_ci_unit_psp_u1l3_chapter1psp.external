# Chapter 1: The problem Solving Process 

##### Future units in CS Discoveries will present problems in contexts that may or may not be familiar. A structured problem solving process will be an important tool for helping students move forward in the face of novel and complex challenges.


## Why aren't my students on the computer? 

##### Students often enter a CS Discoveries classroom expecting to be on the computer right away. The course intentionally begins with "non-computational" problems. Computer science is fundamentally a problem-solving discipline and staying away from traditional computer science problems at this point helps to frame this class as one about problem-solving more generally with computer science being a new "tool" to help attack certain types of problems. Spending the time here building a solid foundation with the Problem Solving Process will set students up for future successes. 

## Let's practice solving a problem!
