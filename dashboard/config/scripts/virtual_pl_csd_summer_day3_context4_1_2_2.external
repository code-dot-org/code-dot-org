#### In diverse classrooms, the topic of differentiation is important. While differentiation can support and/or challenge students, it can also alienate students who feel "targeted" by differentiation or feel like differentiation is sending a message that they do not belong in the classroom. This session is intended to help you consider this dilemma.
#### Many of the strategies you use for differentiation in other subjects might be used in CS Principles as well. As you think about differentiating for computer science, consider what you have seen so far in Unit 3.

#### 1. What differentiation strategies do you think would be helpful in this unit?
