```
var count = 0
while (count != 5){
  console.log(count);
  count = count + 2;
}
```

**Explanation:** The variable `count` is initialized with the value `0`. Each time the while-loop runs, the value stored in `count` increases by 2 (0, 2, 4, 6â€¦.). This means that the Boolean expression `count != 5` will never evaluate to `false` and the program will result in an infinite loop.

[Lesson 5 - Loops Explore](https://studio.code.org/s/csp5-2021/lessons/5) introduced students to the concept of an infinite loop and the conditions that can cause one to result.
