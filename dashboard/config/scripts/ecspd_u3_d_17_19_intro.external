#### Key Concepts

1. Students will create a 3 page website about their future using the design elements learned so far.

#### Common Difficulties

Students are expected to create a website about their future and sometimes that is a stretch for students to think of what they want to do or be.  You may want to come up with some topics they can write about.

They may also want to add elements that you don't know how to do, so you will want to think back to some of the strategies discussed earlier that refer them to asking 3 other students before asking you, challenge them to find out and tell you the next day, etc.
