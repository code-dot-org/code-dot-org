# Internet Simulator: FAQ

#### Where can I find the activities you've designed to use with the Internet Simulator?
The activities we've designed for our Computer Science Principles curriculum, including the specific Internet Simulator configurations can be found in the Unit lesson plans [here](https://code.org/educate/csp). Many of the lesson plans have "Teacher Tips & Tricks" support videos that show demonstrations of the Internet Simulator used as a part of the classroom activities. You can use these activities as is, or feel free to modify to best suit your class!

#### Can I customize the Internet Simulator for my class?
Right now, we unfortunately don't have a way for people outside of Code.org to create specific configurations and instructions for the Internet Simulator. We've tried to expose a variety of different configurations that can hopefully work for your classroom and activity. Long-term, we'd love to have a way to let others configure the tool.

#### My students can't see each other when they go to the URL I give them for the Internet Simulator. What do I do?
For students to see each other in the lobby of the Internet Simulator, they'll need to be in the same section. Double check that you've completed the section setup instructions from the previous page, and that the students in question have joined that specific section code. Also, some students may be in multiple sections if they've done coursework with Code.org before, so make sure they know the name of your section and have picked it in the dropdown before entering the lobby.
