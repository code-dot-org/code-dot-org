A compression scheme for long strings of bits called *run-length encoding* is described as follows: 

Rather than record each 0 and 1 individually, instead record “runs” of bits by storing the number of consecutive 1s and 0s that appear.  

Since it’s binary, any run of 0s must be followed by a run of 1s (even if the run is only 1-bit long) and vice versa. Thus, you can store a list of small numbers that represents the alternating runs of 0s and 1s.  Here is an example:

To uncompress the data back into its original binary state, you simply reverse the process.  This technique is an example of what type of compression?
