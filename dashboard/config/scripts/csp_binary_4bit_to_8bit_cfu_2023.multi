question 'Two schools are merging and to adapt to the increased size of the student body, the school is changing its system for keeping track of all student IDs from a system that uses 4-bit binary numbers to one that uses 8-bit binary numbers (AKA 1 byte). Which of the following best describes what effect this change will have?'

wrong 'The 8-bit system will be able to represent twice as many values as the 4-bit system.'
right 'The 8-bit system will be able to represent eight times as many values as the 4-bit system.'
wrong 'The 8-bit system will be able to represent ten times as many values as the 4-bit system.'
wrong 'The 8-bit system will be able to represent the same number of values as the 4-bit system, it will just include more zeros.'
