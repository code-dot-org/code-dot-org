# HTML Overview

## What is HTML?

#### HTML stands for **Hypertext Markup Language**. HTML is used to add structure to the content of a web page.

#### You can think of coding a web page like building a house. The words, images, headers, and other elements on your web page are like the building materials you use for construction. HTML takes those elements and structures them neatly to build a simple house.

## What is an HTML Element?

#### An HTML element is a piece of a website that is marked by a start tag and sometimes closed with an end tag. The element also includes the content inside the tags.

## What is an HTML Tag?

#### An HTML tag is the special set of characters that tells the computer where the start or end of an HTML element is and what type it is.


* #### `<!DOCTYPE html>` - Tells the computer that this is a document written in HTML.
* #### `<html>` - Indicates the beginning of your code written in HTML.
* #### `<head>` - Contains information (sometimes called "metadata") about your web page.
* #### `<body>` - Contains all the main content of your web page.
* #### `<p>` - Defines a paragraph of written text.

#### As students discuss HTML tags, make sure they understand that HTML tags are used to structure, or organize, content on the screen.
