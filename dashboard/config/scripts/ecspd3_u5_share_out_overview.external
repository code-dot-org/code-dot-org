## What have we done so far?

- Developed a deeper understanding of the core concepts covered in ECS Unit 5
- Experienced an activity from at least one lesson from Unit 5
- Considered how you would teach that lesson 
- Connected with the Code.org CSP community for additional support throughout Unit 3

> ## What will we do now? 
> - Share your data visualization or other artifact from your lesson, the resource you created, and your feedback and thoughts on the lesson in the forums 
- Submit a link to your forum post for review
- Check out the work other ECE teachers produced in their challenges
