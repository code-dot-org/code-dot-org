Pair programming is a technique in which two programmers work together at one computer. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the navigator, directs the driver on the design and setup of the code. The two programmers switch roles often.

## What is my role as the teacher? 

##### As the teacher, you play a critical role in determining and establishing routines for how your students will use the pair programming strategy. 

## Pair programming has been shown to:

* ##### Improve computer science enrollment, retention, and students' performance.
* ##### Increase students' confidence.
* ##### Develop students' critical thinking skills.
* ##### Introduce students to the “real world” working environment.


## To begin pair programming with your students:

1. ##### Form pairs.
2. ##### Give each pair one computer.
3. ##### Decide upon initial roles (driver or navigator).
4. ##### Have students start working. 
5. ##### Ensure that students switch roles at regular intervals (every 3 to 5 minutes).
6. ##### Ensure that the navigators remain active participants. 

## How is pair programming connected to the curriculum?

##### There are many lessons on the computer designed to help students develop programming skills. Pair programming can foster a sense of camaraderie and collaboration in the classroom while students are working on computers. In addition, pair programming can promote inclusion by reducing the "confidence gap" between female and male students while increasing all students' programming confidence. 

## How does pair programming work on the Code.org platform?

##### You can enable pair programming for your class sections within the Code.org learning platform. Students will then be able to choose teammates from a list of other students in their section. You will be able to track both team progress and individual student progress from your teacher dashboard. Levels completed using the pair programming feature will have a people icon in the center of the completed level bubble.
