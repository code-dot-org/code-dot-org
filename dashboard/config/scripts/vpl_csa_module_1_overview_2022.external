# Module 3: CS Discoveries Virtual Professional Learning

## Module 3 Overview

Welcome to the asynchronous work for Module 3 for CS Discoveries!  

The asynchronous work here will feed into the upcoming synchronous workshop of this module and help you understand the content and curriculum as you prepare to teach your own students. The asynchronous work for Module 3 takes about 90 minutes to complete.  Feel free to start and stop at your own pace.

Module 3 introduces Unit 4 - The Design Process and focuses on the themes of the "Role of the Student" and active learning in the classroom. As you progress through this asynchronous work, continue to build from the previous module and how your role as the teacher supports active learning for students in your classroom. 

**During this asynchronous work you will:**

* Preview Unit 4 content which focuses on user centered software design
* Become familiar with the Problem Solving Process for **Design** to support students in developing empathy for users
* Reflect on the role of the student as an active learner and effective group member
* Become familiar with a data inquiry cycle in support of equity in CS
