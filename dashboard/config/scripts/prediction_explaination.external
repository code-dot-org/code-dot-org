#### This type of level is a prediction level. Prediction levels help students think logically about code by guessing what they think will happen after reading the code. 

#### **Teacher tip**: Prediction levels are a great place for class discussions. Allow students to share guesses. After running the code, debrief on why the code did what it did reinforcing understanding of the programming concepts.
