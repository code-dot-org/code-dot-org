# Unit 1: Lesson 12 - The Need for DNS

## Background

It would be impossible for packets to be routed across the internet without IP addresses. The problem with this system is that, while computers are good at referring to other computers by numbers, humans are not. The Domain Name System (DNS) solves this problem so that we can identify a webpage by its name, even when the IP addresses change.

## Vocabulary

* **DNS:** an abbreviation for Domain Name System, the Internet's system for converting alphabetic names into numeric IP addresses.

## Lesson

* Discover how DNS translates human-readable locations on the Internet into a numeric IP address.
* Use the Internet Simulator to send requests to the built-in DNS to get the IP addresses of other computers in the network.
* Watch a video to learn about the hierarchy of DNS.
* Examine real-world issues related to DNS
