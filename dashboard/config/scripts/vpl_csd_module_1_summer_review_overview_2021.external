#Review of Concepts from the Summer Workshop

**Goal:** The purpose of the following activities is to review Unit 3 content from the summer before moving on to new Unit 3 content. (Estimated time: 10 minutes)

During the summer we started to dig into Unit 3: Interactive Animations and Games. Already we have:

* Looked at Lessons 2, 3, and 4
* Explored Game Lab 
* Learned about plotting shapes using a grid
* Used parameters to change the size of our shapes. 

In Module 1, we will continue our exploration of Unit 3 content as we build on the skills we learned over the summer.
