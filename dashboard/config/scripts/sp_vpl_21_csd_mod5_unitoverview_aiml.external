# Unit overview

####  AI and machine learning impact our entire world, changing how we live and how we work. That's why it’s critical for all of us to understand this increasingly important technology, including not just how it’s designed and applied, but also its societal and ethical implications. Unit 7 of CS Discoveries focuses on AI ethics, examines issues of bias, and explores and explains fundamental concepts of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

##

* #### **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** - when a machine acts in ways that mimic human intelligence such as playing a game, creating works of art, having a conversation, performing routine tasks, or solving problems. 

* #### **Machine learning** - how computers recognize patterns and make decisions without being explicitly programmed.

## Students will:

* ##### Learn how machine learning models use data to make decisions.
* ##### Create a machine learning model to solve a problem.
* ##### Test and evaluate machine learning models for accuracy and potential bias. 
* ##### Create an app that uses their machine learning model.

### **Implementation guidance** 

* ##### Complete Unit 1 Chapter 1 before starting this unit.
* ##### This unit assumes students have seen App Lab from Unit 4: The Design Process before starting the unit. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SkMCN4Eid3-mGoRUQkurQGJqoOJ9PydfB7uGE0xZyFA/preview" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here</a> to learn more about the App Lab expectations in this unit, and ways to introduce App Lab to students before starting the unit.
* ##### This is an optional unit that can be used in place of another CS Discoveries unit - see the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u-eIlB2cAwMuSckzbMWkteQIcsXgez7FTrbjP8PBB4o/preview" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Implementation Guide Guide</a> for more information
