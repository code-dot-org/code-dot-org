Learning Objective: **6.2.1** and Essential Knowledge statements: **6.2.1A**
<hr>
 (A) A is incorrect. The internet uses IP Addresses which use hierarchical addressing to identify the larger location of an IP Address, and then identifying the specific location.
	

<hr>
 (B) B is incorrect. The addressing system adopted by the postal service sorts mail by state to be sent to, then by the more specific cities,street and eventually that exact destination.
	

<hr>
 (C) C is correct. An iteration is not an example of a hierarchy. An iteration refers to an Algorithm that is repeated a certain number of times based on a stated logic.

<hr>
 (D) D is incorrect. DNS systems are hierarchical because it orders the domains from the root level down to the host.
