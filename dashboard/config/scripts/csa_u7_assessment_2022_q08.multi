Consider the following recursive method.

```
/** Precondition: num >= 0 */
public static int what(int num) {
  if (num < 10) {
    return num;
  }
  else {
    return num % 10 + what(num/10);
  }
}
```

Assume that `int val` has been declared and initialized with a value that satisfies the precondition of the method. Which of the following best describes the value returned by the call `what(val)`?
