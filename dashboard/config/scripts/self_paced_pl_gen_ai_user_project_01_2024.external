# Lesson 26: Project: Solving Community Problems with Chatbots

#### In the project, students create a chatbot that addresses a personally relevant issue or an issue in their community. Students rely on the user-centered design strategies theyâ€™ve seen throughout the unit to create issue statements, design a chatbot, perform user testing, and reflect on the results. Optionally, students can design a presentation on their project and the problem it was designed to address.
