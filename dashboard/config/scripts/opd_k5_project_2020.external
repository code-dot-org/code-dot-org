## New teaching practice: End of course projects

- Each course offers the opportunity for students to take what theyâ€™ve learned and put it together into a unique project that represents their own creativity. 
- Students are encouraged to plan, build, revise, and present projects of their own. 
- Following a project from inception to delivery offers an inside look at the software development cycle. These guided projects offer scaffolded rubrics for the benefit of both student and teacher.
