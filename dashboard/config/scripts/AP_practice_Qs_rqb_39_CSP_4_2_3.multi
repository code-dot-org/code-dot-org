Learning Objective: **4.2.3** and Essential Knowledge statements: **4.2.3B**
<hr>
 (A) <strong>This answer is not the correct choice.</strong>  There are some problems which cannot be solved using any algorithm.

<hr>
 (B) <strong>This answer is the correct choice.</strong> Decidable problems are ones which have a yes or no answer.  However, they do not necessarily run in polynomial time.

<hr>
 (C) <strong>This answer is not the correct choice.</strong>  Any algorithm can be constructed using only sequencing, iteration, and selection.

<hr>
 (D) <strong>This answer is not the correct choice.</strong>  Any algorithm can be constructed using only sequencing, iteration, and selection.
