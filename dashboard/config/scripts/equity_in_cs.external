# Necessary Background >> The Need for Equity in Computer Science

_**So why push for equity in computer science?  Shouldn't the industry be content to realize that some people are just not interested, and leave it at that?**_

Not at all. It's not only about industry.  In the years to come, programming will be as important to society as reading and writing, and those who don't receive a good CS education will be left behind.  Students won't need to chose software engineering as a career in order to use computer science on a daily basis. In that way, lack of equitable computer science education has the ability to create greater class separation, all based upon misconceptions of what a computer scientist is supposed to be.

For those that do decide to enter the tech industry, diversity is even more important. 

By 2014, the largest demographic in the gaming industry was <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/geek/adult-women-largest-gaming-demographic/" target="_new">adult women</a>. In contrast, they only make up <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/01/27/women-remain-outsiders-video-game-industry/275JKqy3rFylT7TxgPmO3K/story.html" target="_new">about 11% of game designers and 3% of game programmers</a>, as a result, the vast majority of games are still designed for male consumers. 

Similarly, people of color are among the <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3014434/startup-cultures-lack-of-diversity-stifles-innovation" target="_new">fastest growing demographic of smartphone users</a>, and yet African American, Latino/a, and Hispanic programmers make up <a href="http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat11.htm" target="_new">fewer than 11%</a> of all app developers.  

Can you imagine how much more helpful and useful software would be to _**everyone**_ if everyone was more equally represented while it was being created?
