# Discussing Cleaning Data  

## Discuss and Compare

#### A key idea in Data Science is that information can be represented in a variety of ways; data scientists have to make choices, and these choices have trade-offs.

#### When students compare their work, they have an opportunity to both communicate the choices they made and to see the choices made by another student. 

#### When they connect back to the source of information - whether it be a primary source or a data set - students are pushed to consider what information is represented in their work, and what information is not.

## Consider the Ethical Framework 

#### **Discuss:** Which do you think should be prioritized when deciding how to clean data?

#### For **Accuracy and Bias**, students may bring up things like:

- #### Changing the format allows the cleaners bias to enter the picture
- #### Cleaned data is not accurately what the person wanted
- #### Cleaned Data helps form a more accurate picture -- someone who misspelled pepperoni still wants pepperoni pizza

#### For **Privacy**, students may bring up things like:

- #### Creating categories can unintentionally identify certain members of a group

#### For **Misuse and Consent**, students may bring up things like:

- #### Itâ€™s possible that people have not consented to their data being used in this altered, cleaned, format
