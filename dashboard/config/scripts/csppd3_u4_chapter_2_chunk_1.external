### CS Concepts

* Whereas **Moore's Law** describes the exponential growth in computing power over the 20th century, a parallel phenomenon is now leading to **exponential growth in the amount of data** that is collected and accessed every day.
* Most fields now rely upon data in some form and **provide more convenient and even transformational services** thanks to the insights they are able to develop from data.
* Widespread collection of data poses potential threats to our collective **security and privacy**.
* Individuals and organizations can **take preventative measures** to better protect security and privacy.

### Vocabulary

* **Moore's Law:** the observation that computing power roughly doubles every two years
* **Big Data:** a broad term for datasets so large or complex that traditional data porcessing applications are inadequate
