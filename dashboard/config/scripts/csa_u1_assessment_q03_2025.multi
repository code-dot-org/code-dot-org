while (myPainter.canMove()) {
  myPainter.move();
}
```

teacher_markdown <<MARKDOWN
A loop terminates when the condition is `false`. Since the condition for this `while` loop checks if the `Painter` object can move forward in the direction it is facing, it will terminate when this is no longer `true`. This means that the loop will terminate when the `Painter` object can no longer move east.
