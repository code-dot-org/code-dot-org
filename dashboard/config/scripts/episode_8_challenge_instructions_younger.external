### Unplugged

No computer? No problem! Print out [this worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cRPELQ28TZMJhc68-eYP1D26Uqzcyfx4RDYuThZJGLo/edit?usp=sharing), then cut out the programming blocks and write a program on paper using variables! For extra fun: find some cardboard and make your own pretend computer and draw the display for your program. Don't forget to take a picture of your "computer" and send it in to #CodeBreak!

### Sprite Lab

**Do This:** Add more features to the game we programmed during this week's Code Break. What happens when the player character touches other aliens? Should there be more coins? What about more aliens? Can you change the background and sprites? Have fun and share with us what you create!
