# Sharing Student Work > Post to the forum

With your student artifacts in hand, it's time to share with your peers. Post 3-5 (or more if you wish) student programs to attached forum. For each project give a link and provide a brief description of what makes it interesting.

After you've commented take some time to read through and comment on the other posts
