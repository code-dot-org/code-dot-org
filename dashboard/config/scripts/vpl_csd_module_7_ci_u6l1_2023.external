# Unit 7 - AI and Machine Learning

> ##### <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/csd7-2023" target="blank">Unit 7 - AI and Machine Learning</a>

## Unit Overview

##### In this unit, students learn how computers can find patterns in data to make decisions. They use the Problem Solving Process for machine learning to define a problem, prepare their data, train a model, then test and evaluate their model for accuracy and potential bias. Students explore a variety of scenarios and datasets that lend themselves to machine learning. They also explore some of the modern problems with machine learning, especially around bias and impact.

##### Students will:
* ##### Test and evaluate machine learning models for accuracy and potential bias.
* ##### Learn how machine learning models use data to make decisions.
* ##### Create a machine learning model to solve a problem.
* ##### Create an app that uses their machine learning model.

## Investigation Tasks

* ##### Review the Unit 7 page
