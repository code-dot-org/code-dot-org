## Unit 3: Lesson 16 - Permanent Data Storage

# Background

In the previous lesson, you used a variable to add a “best score” feature to your clicker game which worked for multiple plays in the same session. Variables can be thought of as temporary data storage which exists independently for each run of the program. A permanent “best score” which persists between plays of the game can be achieved using key/value pairs in remote data storage.

# Lesson

* Explore using permanent data storage.
* Learn key/value pair syntax. 
* Update your clicker game to save the “best score” permanently.
