# Best Practices for Teaching with micro:bit

#### Physical computing is a fun and hands-on way to engage students in coding, however, there are some things to consider to make sure your lessons run smoothly. 



## Organization/set up tips

- #### Labeling the micro:bit is a simple way to assign them to people and count them in and out.

- #### Use the original anti-static pouch to store the micro:bits to protect the device.

- #### Remind students to be gentle when handling their micro:bit. Only handle the  micro:bit by its edges and avoid touching the components when the power is running.

- #### To store multiple micro:bits, there exists a multitude of creative options. Containers can be purchased from a supermarket  perfect to store micro:bits, batteries, cases, USB leads and peripherals like speakers and all-important stickers!

## Relate to familiar concepts 



- #### Use everyday examples to explain the concepts of inputs and outputs in a way that is relatable to their experiences

- #### Review coding concepts like events and loops that have been learned in class and remind students that these concepts carry over to help them code their micro:bits. 

- #### Provide a real-world context or scenario where the micro:bit can be used. For example, creating a temperature sensor to measure the weather or a step counter for fitness.

## No validation - push the creativity 
- #### Unlike some of the coding levels on the Code.org platform, MakeCode does not have validation to “pass.” 
- #### Encourage students to be creative and explore the possibilities. 
- #### Celebrate perserverance and trying new things, even if it doesn't always work.

## Discussion/ Share out
- #### Enrich students’ experience with physical computing by building in discussion and sharing amongst students. Students can share or demo their projects, discuss what was easy/challenging and what they liked best about the experience.
