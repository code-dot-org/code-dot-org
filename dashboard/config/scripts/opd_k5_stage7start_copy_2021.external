# Introduction to Events

Students use Play Lab to program "events" in animated games they create. Play Lab is a tool that allows students to program stories and games using backgrounds and characters.

## CS Concepts

>An **event** is a line of code that tells your computer to "listen" for something to happen, then take an action.  For example, web pages may include a drop down menu when you roll over the navigation bar with your mouse.  The "mouse rollover" is an event that triggers an action.

"Events" are introduced in Courses A through C with a **context-setting** lesson in which students engage in an unplugged (off the computer) activity.

Preview and read the lesson plan for the **context-setting** lesson in <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/coursea-2021/lessons/11" target="blank">Course A - Lesson 11:  The Big Event Jr.</a> to understand how "events" are introduced to students.
