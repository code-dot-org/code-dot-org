## Videos for teachers on each unplugged activity

At this point, you may be saying to yourself, how do I learn about all the unplugged activities I'm supposed to be teaching? The lesson plans for each activity explain in depth what you need to know and have on hand to teach that lesson, but if you're looking for a quick overview, Kiki Prottsman, who is Executive Director for [Thinkersmith](http://thinkersmith.org/) who collaborated to create this curriculum, has produced videos that explain each one of the unplugged activities in Courses 1, 2, and 3.
