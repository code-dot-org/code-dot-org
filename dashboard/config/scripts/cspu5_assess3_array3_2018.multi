**Content: Unit 5 Lesson 13**

Going through the code line by line:

* An array named _data_ is given, it contains "0,1,2"
* Remember that with the INSERT method, everything after the inserted index is shifted to the right
* A value of 3 is inserted at index 1. data = [3,0,1,2]
* A value of 4 is inserted at index 2. data = [3,4,0,1,2]
* A value of 5 is inserted at index 3. data = [3,4,5,0,1,2]
* The data now holds "3,4,5,0,1,2"
