##Chemical Changes
**A chemical change can not be reversed and happens when one substance is transformed into one or more different substances.**

Here are a few examples: 
- A raw egg turns into a cooked egg on the stove.
- A fresh apple changes into a rotten apple after too much time.
- A piece of metal changes into rust after it is exposed to moisture.
- The food you swallow changes in your stomach during digestion.
- Raw cookie dough mixture changes into a cookie in the hot oven.
- A piece of wood changes to charcoal after it is burnt.
