* ##### Identify the parts of your problem you could address with data, and how more information could help

## Prepare
* ##### Decide what kinds of data you will collect
* ##### Decide how you will collect the data and in which format you will collect itr
* ##### Anticipate possible challenges in data collection and change your plan to account for them
* ##### Develop a plan for how you will analyze your data and make sure your data will be useful for that kind of analysis

## Try
* ##### Collect your data using the plan you created
* ##### Clean your data by removing errors, unexpected values, and inconsistencies
* ##### Visualize the data by creating tables, graphs, or charts that help you see broad trends in your data
* ##### Interpret the trends and patterns in your visualizations based on your knowledge of the problem


## Reflect
