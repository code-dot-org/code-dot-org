Consider the following class definition.

```
class Player
{
   private String name;
   private int score;
   /* missing constructor */
}
```

The following statement appears in a method in a class other than Player. It is intended to create a new Player object `player1` with its attributes set to `"Brianna"` and `280`.

`Player player1 = new Player("Brianna", 280);`

Which of the following can be used to replace /* missing constructor */ so that the object `player1` is correctly created?
