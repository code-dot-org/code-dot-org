## Code.org's Vision

##### **"Every student in every school has the opportunity to learn computer science as part of their core K-12 education."**

##### Code.org is part of a larger computer science community working towards equity in CS and collaborates with other equity-minded computer science organizations such as Microsoft, National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT), CSforAll, and the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA).

***

##### **“Computing and technology hold the promise of solving problems big and small and shaping the world around us. But if the people who work in computing related jobs don’t represent our communities and our populations, the solutions they develop won’t be representative either.”** - <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NNS1M4aY4WpfJ8glZBUqIDPvhAimZRtr/view">Guide to inclusive CS education, 2019 </a>
