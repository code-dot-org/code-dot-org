    val = 0
    i = 1
    REPEAT 3 TIMES
    {
        val = val + data[i]
        i = i + 1
    }
    DISPLAY (val)

Going through the code line by line as it repeats while keeping track of data[]:

* Currently, data = [3,10,4,9,16]
* val is set to 0, and i is set to 1
* Every time the loop repeats, val equals the current val plus the data at index i. i is incremented by one.
* First repetition: val = 0, i = 1, data[i] = 3. val = 0 + 3 = 3
* Second repetition: val = 3, i = 2, data[i] = 10. val = 3 + 10 = 13
* Third repetition: val = 13, i = 3, data[i] = 4. val = 13 + 4 = 17
* val is displayed where val = 17
