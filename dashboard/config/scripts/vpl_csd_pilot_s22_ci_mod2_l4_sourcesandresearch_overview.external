# Sources and research

##### As students are working on building their own website, they are encouraged to also think about their responsibility as consumers of information. 

## Lesson 16 overview

##### This lesson encourages students to think more about how to find relevant and trustworthy information online. After viewing and discussing a video about how search engines work, students will search for information relevant to their site. They'll need to analyze the sites they find for credibility to decide which are appropriate to use on their own website.
