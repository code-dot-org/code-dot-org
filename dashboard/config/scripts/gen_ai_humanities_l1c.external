## Grammar and Style Correction

**Task:** Improve the grammar and style of the following sentence: "Running fast the dog through the park chasing the frisbee."

### Steps

1. **Understanding the task:** You will be crafting a prompt that asks an AI tool to correct the grammar and improve the style of a given sentence.

   Think about the specific grammatical issues in the sentence and what improvements are needed for better readability.

2. **Crafting your prompt:** Start by identifying the grammatical errors in the sentence. For example, it lacks proper sentence structure and subject-verb agreement.

   Consider how to clearly ask the AI to focus on these specific issues to improve the sentence.

3. **Writing your prompt:** Write a prompt that is clear and specific. Here is an example to get you started:

> Improve the grammar and style of the following sentence: 'Running fast the dog through the park chasing the frisbee.' Ensure the sentence has correct subject-verb agreement and flows smoothly

4. **Using the AI tool:** Enter your prompt into the AI tool, and review the response. Assess whether it meets your expectations and addresses the grammatical issues.

5. **Evaluate the response:** Consider the following questions when evaluating the AI's response:

   * Does the sentence have correct grammar and subject-verb agreement?
   
   * Is the sentence clear and easy to read?
   
   * Has the overall style and flow of the sentence improved?

6. **Refining your prompt:** If the AI's response is not as expected, think about how you can improve your prompt. You might need to add more detail or be more specific about what you want.

   Adjust your prompt and try again until you get a satisfactory response.
