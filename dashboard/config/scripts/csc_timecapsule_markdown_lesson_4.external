##Share Your Time Capsule

Now that you have coded your time capsule poem, it's time to share it out! 

As you view your classmates' projects consider the following questions:

1. What images and sounds did you see in your classmatesâ€™ time capsules?
2. How were their stories different from yours?
3. How were their stories similar to yours?
4. How did their images make you feel?
