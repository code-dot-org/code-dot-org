A raw digital sound file samples a sound wave at some interval and measures the height of the wave at each point.  Thus, raw sound is recorded as a list of numbers. 

In very broad terms the **MP3 audio compression** algorithm identifies frequencies and volume levels - low and high - that are outside the range of  human hearing and removes the data representing these frequencies from the original.  This technique results in a smaller audio file that sounds exactly the same to the human ear.  

This technique is an example of what type of compression?
