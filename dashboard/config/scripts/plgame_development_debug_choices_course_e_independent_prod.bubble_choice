description '**Teacher Tip:** Support students by positively framing debugging challenges. Have them read the code out loud and begin by identifying the bug. Then try one thing at a time until they find the fix. By being patient and not giving up, they will get better at fixing problems and learn a lot along the way! <br> Choose a game to fix.'
