Consider the following instance variable and method.

```
private int[] values;

/**
 * Precondition: values.length > 0
 */
public int checkArray() {
  int loc = 0;
  
  for (int k = 1; k < values.length; k++) {
    if (values[k] < values[loc]) {
      loc = k;
    }
  }

  return loc;
}
```

Which of the following is the best postcondition for `checkArray`?

Let's analyze the code to understand why:

1. The method `checkArray` iterates over the array `values` using a `for` loop, starting from index `1` and going up to `values.length - 1`. This loop is designed to find the smallest value in the array.

2. The variable `loc` is initialized to `0`, assuming the smallest value is initially at index `0`.

3. In each iteration of the loop, the condition `values[k] < values[loc]` is checked, comparing the current element at index `k` with the element at the current smallest index `loc`.

4. If the value at index `k` is smaller than the value at index `loc`, it means a new smallest value has been found. In that case, the variable `loc` is updated to the current index `k`.

5. After the loop completes, the index `loc` holds the index of the smallest value found in the array.

6. The method returns the value of `loc`, which represents the index of the smallest value in the array.

Therefore, the best postcondition for the `checkArray` method is: "Returns the index of the smallest value in the array `values`." This accurately describes the behavior and purpose of the method, indicating that it will find and return the index of the smallest value in the array.
