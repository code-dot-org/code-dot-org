question '**Which of the following indicates understanding of using model cards to identify machine learning bias?**'
wrong 'A limitation of the model is that it should not be used in a way that could reduce care for people entering an emergency room.'
right 'The model was trained using data from a remote hospital in Alaska that relies on features related to temperature and winter sports.'
wrong 'Hospitals should not use machine learning models to determine medical priority.'
wrong 'There is probably a bug in the app. The company should check to make sure the code is accurate.'

#### After students learn how to use model cards, you use the following prompt as a formative assessment. 

#### A hospital in New Orleans hired a company to create an app to help prioritize patients when they come into the ER. The company used a machine learning model that is 88% accurate to build the app, however, the app is not accurately predicting medical priority for the hospital in New Orleans. Use the model card below to suggest a possible explanation for the apps decreased accuracy for why the app is not accurately predicting medical priority at the New Orleans hospital.

**Explanation:** Machine learning is only as good as the data you put into it. It is important to use a lot of high quality data. Biased data favors some things and de-prioritizes or excludes others. By learning from biased data, the computer may make biased predictions. 

In this example, the date prioritizes medical data based on ER patients in a rural hospital in a cold climate. Common ailments for ER patients at an urban hospital in a warmer climate are de-prioritized resulting in a model with low accuracy for the New Orleans hospital.
