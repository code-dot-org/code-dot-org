</p>

## What is Use-Modify-Create?

* #### Three progressive stages to help students develop their programming skills
* #### First, students use existing software.
* #### Then, they modify this software to explore how changes affect outcomes.
* #### Last, they create their own projects from scratch, applying their acquired skills to design and implement original software. 

#### This method supports incremental learning, builds confidence, and mirrors real-world programming practices, making it an effective pedagogical strategy for teaching computer science.

##Use-Modify-Create in Game Design Module 
####In the game design module, students begin by <b>using</b> four pre-created games.Then, they will practice coding with variables by <b>modifying</b> and building on existing code.To complete this lesson, students will have an opportunity to use what they learned to practice and free-play to <b>create</b> a game.
