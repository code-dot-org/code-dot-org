# What is a Paper Prototype?

<div style="background-color: #F7F8FA; border-radius: 40px; color: #000000; width: 95%; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;"> <p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 18px;">

## **Key Vocabulary**
* #### **Prototype** - A first or early model of a product that allows you to test assumptions before developing a final version.
* #### **User Interface** - The visual elements of a program through which a user controls or communicates with the application. Often abbreviated UI.</p> </div>

#### Throughout the Design Process unit, students will use **paper prototypes** as a quick tool to kick off the development of an app. Paper prototypes are used by designers in many industries to create low-stakes, low-cost first drafts of their final products. 

#### Check out some real-world examples below. While you do so, ask yourself, **"Why might a designer choose to start with a paper prototype?"**

Notice that this designer has overlaid their app design on top of an iPad to give users a sense of scale during testing. This app seems to suggest curated video playlists to their users, who can skip or save a video for later.<br><br>Tobe101, CC BY-SA 4.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0>, via Wikimedia Commons |

The designer shows different elements on a mobile phone-sized device. Based on the screen and the buttons on the bottom, what do you think this app might be for? <br><br>d_jan, CC BY 2.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0>, via Wikimedia Commons |

Designers in this image are prototyping a board game. They appear to be roleplaying gameplay to surface pain points and key feedback for a next draft of their game. <br><br>&quot;<a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/_scypher/4552934264/' target='_blank'>First prototype</a>&quot; (<a rel='license' href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/' target='_blank'>CC BY-NC 2.0</a>) by <a xmlns:cc='http://creativecommons.org/ns#' rel='cc:attributionURL' property='cc:attributionName' href='https://www.flickr.com/people/_scypher/' target='_blank'>Elliot Trinidad</a></div> |
