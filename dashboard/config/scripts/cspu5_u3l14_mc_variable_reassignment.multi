## Can you figure out the values of a, b, and c?

Using what you know about variables and re-assignment you should be able to trace this code and keep track of the values of a, b, and c as they change.  You should also have a sense of any possible errors that could occur.

Trace the code, and choose the option that correctly shows what will be displayed.
