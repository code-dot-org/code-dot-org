A 2-sided coin has an equal likelihood of landing on each side. One side is called "heads" and the other is called "tails". The program below simulates randomly flipping that coin many times.

```
var heads = 0;
var tails = 0;
var rolls = 100;
for(var i = 0; i < rolls; i++){
  if(randomNumber(0,1) == 0){
    heads++
  } else {
    tails++
  }
}
```


Which of the following is NOT a possible combination of values of the variables in this program when it finishes running?
