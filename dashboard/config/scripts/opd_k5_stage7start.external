Thus far, you’ve learned how to sequence a program, add loops, and use conditionals and functions. You’re almost done!   

In this stage, we’re going to look at *events*, another core concept in computer science. As we explore events, you will synthesize what you’ve learned so far and write some more complex programs.

By completing Stage 8, you will:

- Practice coding simple events
- Reflect on classroom application

>**What to Expect in this Stage:** We’ll start with a video explaining events. Then, we’ll explore some puzzles from Course F that allow you to experiment with event blocks. We’ll close with an opportunity to review resources and reflect. You should spend between 20-45 minutes on this stage.

Ready? Let's go!
