# User Testing

##### For this activity, students use this paper prototype to test out an app. One person will be the **user**, who will try to use the paper prototype. Another person will be the **computer**, who is in charge of changing the screens and reacting to what the user does. Our goal is to collect feedback so we can make recommendations and improve it.

1. ##### The Computer places the home screen (the one titled "Txt Ur Grndkds") in front of the User.

2. ##### The User selects a task from the table on their activity guide.
	##### **Example tasks:**
    * ##### *View Suzette's information*
    * ##### *Get help on how to use the app*
    * ##### *Find out when Suzette‚Äôs birthday is*

3.  ##### The User attempts to complete the tasking by "clicking" on the paper prototype screen in front of them.
4. ##### Every time the User clicks on the screen, the Computer consults the Navigation Diagram on their activity guide.
	* ##### If the Navigation Diagram shows a line connected to the element that was clicked, find the screen at the other end of the line and place it in front of the user.
	* ##### If the Navigation Diagram doesn't show a line connected to the element that was clicked, do nothing.
5. ##### When the User completes a task (or decides it is impossible in the current prototype), they fill out the "What I Tried" and "My Reaction" columns and the computer resets the app back to the home screen.

##### Students should **connect specific user experiences to problems with the app** and brainstorm **how those problems could be addressed** in future iterations of the app. If necessary, ask students to recount specific incidents during the test that revealed problems with the design. Students should be able to identify actionable points of revision of the design based on the user feedback from this activity. 

##### Students should leave this activity with an **understanding of the importance of paper prototypes**. One of the first steps in designing apps is to make a paper prototype so app designers can test and get feedback early to make sure their app is meeting the needs of their user. This concept will be revisited throughout the Design Process unit.

* ##### The computer's activity guides are used for reference only. Students can look at a digital version during this activity. If you choose to print out the guide, they can be reused, as long as the students are told not to write on them.
* ##### The paper prototype manipulatives will need to be printed and cut out prior to the activity. Each pair will need one set of paper prototype manipulatives. These manipulatives can be reused if students do not write on them.
* ##### Consider modeling the activity before sending students to work together in pairs.
