## What is my role as the teacher? 

##### Your role as the teacher is to provide students with ongoing feedback in order to promote continuous growth. 

## How does the curriculum support assessment? 

##### The course materials contain a number of assessment types and opportunities which can be used **formatively** (to check for understanding) or **summatively** (for evaluation). 

##### For students, the goal of the assessments is to prepare them for the AP exam and performance task. For teachers, the goal is to use assessments to help guide instruction, give feedback to students, and make choices about what to emphasize in lessons.

## Assessment in the curriculum

### **Projects**

##### Each unit, with the exception of Units 6 and 8, contains one project that takes more than one class period. These projects may be used as summative assessments in tandem with the multiple-choice assessment for the unit. Each project takes a different approach to assessing students’ ability to apply what they have learned from the unit.

### **Submittable programming projects**

##### When the curriculum calls for a programming project for assessment, the App Lab environment will show a “Submit” button below the typical “Run” button. When a student submits a project it is submitted with a timestamp and locked for teacher review. It also shows up in a special area of the teacher dashboard. The teacher can release the project back to the student as well.

### **Fixed-response assessments**

#### Lesson assessment items 

##### You will find assessment items (multiple-choice, free-response text) embedded in individual lessons, typically as the last few “bubbles” for a lesson, indicated with an assessment icon. These are intended to be used as formative assessment items. Students can always see them and change their responses at any time.

#### Unit assessments (lockable)

##### You will find a 15-question multiple-choice assessment at the end of each Unit, with the exception of Unit 8.  These are intended to mimic AP-style questions. They look like their own lesson and have lock settings as well as the usual visibility settings. These can be used for formative or summative assessments.  Our suggestion is that if you use these for summative assessment, you use them in tandem with the project-based assessments for that unit to get a more complete picture of students’ skills and knowledge.

##### Lock settings enable or disable students from modifying their answers. For example, you may want to hide an assessment before students get to it, but after students take it, you might want it to remain visible but locked, while you review the answers.

### **Worksheets and activity guides**

##### Worksheets and activity guides are good opportunities for assessment. Worksheets or activity guides often ask students to write, answer questions, and respond to prompts. When available, answer keys for worksheets and activities are provided through the “teacher only” panel on Code Studio.
