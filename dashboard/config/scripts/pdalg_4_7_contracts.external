# Lessons 4-7 > Contracts

Like the Circles of Evaluation, Contracts serve to help clarify student thinking and understanding. A student who can effectively compose a contract for any given function demonstrates an understanding of how that function is to be used (but not necessarily the relationship between its domain and range). This is again a place where some students will feel they can get by just fine without writing down contracts, but will likely get bitten down the road when they encounter functions more complicated than they can solve without support. Push your students to document contracts and you'll save yourself pain down the road as you can direct them to their contract logs to answer questions.

## Keep a Communal Contract Log

One way to help remind students to keep up their contract logs -- and to provide additional support for students working through the Design Recipe -- is to keep a large poster of the Contract Log on your wall. Use this as a place to document contracts from functions that students encounter (both in your own text book and when programming) to strengthen the connection between math and CS for students.
