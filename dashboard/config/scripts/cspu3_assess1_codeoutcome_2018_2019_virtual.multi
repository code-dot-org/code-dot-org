right 'The program will run without error, but will not draw anything.'

* Going through the code line by line, drawStar(0) is called with a parameter of zero.
* For line 2, the function "drawStar(points)" is called where a zero is passed in as a parameter.
* Looking at the 3rd line, a for loop is written but since a parameter of zero is passed in, the loop will repeat the code zero times.
* Therefore, since the parameter passed in is zero, the program does not enter the for loop. It will not have an error, and it will not draw anything.
