Consider the following code segment:

```
String[][] letters = {{"A", "B", "C"},
                      {"D", "E", "F”},
                      {"G", "H", "I"}};
```

Which statement is the correct syntax to access element `"F"` from the `letters` array?

Let's break down the syntax:

* `letters[1]` accesses the second element in the `letters` array, which is the second row.

* `letters[1][2]` then accesses the third element in the second row, which is the element `"F"`.

Remember that array indexing starts from `0`, so `letters[1]` refers to the second row (index `1`), and `letters[1][2]` accesses the third element in that row (index `2`).

Therefore, `letters[1][2]` is the correct syntax to access the element `"F"` from the `letters` array.
