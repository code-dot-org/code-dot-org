# How to Use AI

#### Here are some examples of ways teachers have used AI with their students:

* #### “My students use Claude when they are coding and come across an error they don't understand. They paste in their code and the error message and ask Claude to explain the error to them so they can fix it." 
* #### “When my students are about to start a major project, I have them use Claude to help them make a plan. They often will tell Claude what they want to make and ask it to help them break their task into reasonable chunks. They also use the tool to ensure they have hit all the requirements.”
* #### “I have my students use chatGPT to edit their essays. They prompt it to look for grammatical mistakes.”
* #### “We talk about the challenge of creating prompts that get the AI to do what you actually want. Then, I have students write a short story and challenge them to get Stable Diffusion to generate illustrations for it.”
* #### “I have done AI lessons with 5th/6th graders. What is AI, how it works, and how it affects their social media. We did two different activities quick draw, so students could see how generative AI works/ dance party with AI.”
* #### “In the English classroom, I have used an AI-chatbot via SchoolAI to help students develop a research focus.”

#### Before you start using LLMs (Large Language Models) it's crucial to consider privacy and data security concerns. LLMs can inadvertently store and reveal personal information input during interactions. Educators should confirm their LLM usage complies with educational data protection laws such as FERPA or COPPA.

#### In short, treat data or information you enter into an LLM as public. Don’t include personal information for yourself, colleagues, or students when prompting or chatting with an LLM and caution your students to do the same.

#### We cover this topic in more depth in the Ensuring a Responsible Approach to AI module.
