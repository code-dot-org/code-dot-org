# Debugging

##### Debugging is a significant skill for students to learn in CSA. As a teacher of CS, it is important for teachers to be able to help students "build the muscle" of debugging themselves. That is, teachers should learn how to help students be debuggers rather than do the debugging for students.

## Do this:

* ##### Read through the [lesson plans](https://studio.code.org/s/csa1-2023/lessons/12) and follow along with the slides.
* ##### Complete the [lesson 12](https://studio.code.org/s/csa1-2023/lessons/12) once you have an understanding of the lesson plan. 

## Discussion Questions: 
* ##### Based on your CS Experience, what has been an effective way to support students in building their debugging skills?
* ##### Based on the lesson plans, what is the role of the teacher during this lesson? What is the teacher doing throughout the lesson?
