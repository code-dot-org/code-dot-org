**Content: Unit 5 Lesson 4** -- requires transfer/application of turtle and variable assignment from mathematical expression (in lesson 4)

Going through the code line by line:

* 1: variable "dist" is set to 100
* 2: variable "radius" is set to dist/20 = 5
* 3: The pen is put down to start drawing
* 4: a for loop is initiated and will repeat the code inside it 4 times
* 5: move forward 100 steps
* 6: draws a dot with radius of 5
* 7: turns 90 degrees to the right

After lines 5-7 are repeated four times, a square is drawn with a small circle at each corner. Note that the dots drawn are a lot smaller than the length of the square.
