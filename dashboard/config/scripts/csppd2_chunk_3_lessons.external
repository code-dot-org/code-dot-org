# Chunk 3: Encoding and Sending Text > Exploring the Lessons

## Reviewing Lessons 10 - 11

Below you'll find the first page from lessons 10 - 11, which shows the lesson overview, summary, and resources. **We didn't work through either of these lessons during the in-person PD, so it's likely that both of these lessons are new to you.** In addition to the teacher-facing lesson plan, be on the look out for the following resources: 

- Lesson 10: internet simulator tool, student worksheets, rubric
- Lesson 11: internet simulator tool, student worksheets, rubric

>## Reflect
**While you read over this series of lessons, think about how they fit together and build off of one another.** 

On the next page you'll go through the student activity for lesson 10.
