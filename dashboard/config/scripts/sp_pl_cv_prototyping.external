#### The prototyping stage is the fourth step in the design thinking process, where the team brings their ideas to life through physical or digital models. This stage involves creating simple, experimental versions of the proposed solutions identified during the ideating stage. The purpose of prototyping is to **visualize and test** how these solutions might work in the real world.

#### The prototyping stage is iterative; based on feedback and testing, prototypes are refined, adjusted, or sometimes discarded. Itâ€™s a hands-on phase that encourages practical experimentation and learning, helping to quickly converge on the most effective and user-centered solution before final development begins.
