# Unit 4: Lesson 06 - Discover a Data Story

## Background
In the previous lesson we learned how to use a data visualization tool to create a visualization. 
Sometimes data in its raw state is simply too big to be able to look at and derive any meaning. Even when the data is summarized in a table it can be difficult to “see” what the data shows.  

The point of this lesson is that **data visualization is a useful tool for discovery**.  In today’s activity you and a partner will investigate some sets of data on your own and use visualization to discover a connection or trend. There are several datasets for you to choose from. 

## Vocabulary

* **README** - a document providing background information about a dataset
* **CSV** - abbreviation of “comma-separated values,” this is a widely-used format for storing data
* **Raw data** - the original data as it was collected
* **Summary table** a table of aggregate information about a dataset (e.g., the average, sum, count of some values)

## Lesson

* Explore the 5 datasets with a partner.
* Choose one to explore more deeply.
* Use visualization to discover an interesting connection, trend or pattern.
* Present one along with responses to prompts.
