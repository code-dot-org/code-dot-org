**Content: Unit 5 Lesson 5** - application of local scope and debugging

* The function "fiveMore()" is called.
* Inside this function, a new variable "x" is set to 5
* The computer exits this function and moves on to line 5 where a variable y is created
* The value of y is set to "3 + x" **However**, the variable x was initiated locally inside "fiveMore()" and is not accessible outside of the function. Therefore, there is an error because the variable x does not exist outside the method.
