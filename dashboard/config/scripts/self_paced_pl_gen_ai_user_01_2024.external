#### In this lesson, students explore **design thinking** strategy to identify core issues in their community and brainstorm how generative AI can help solve them. They begin by observing a problem in their community, use the **5 Whyâ€™s strategy** to uncover the root cause, and then brainstorm potential solutions using model cards. This lesson serves as a practice run for skills and processes they will apply in their project later in the unit.
