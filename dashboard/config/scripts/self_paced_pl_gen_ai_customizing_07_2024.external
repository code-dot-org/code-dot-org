# System Prompting

#### There are lots of new key concepts introduced around system prompting that students will engage with during these lessons. We’ve summarized them below.

## Role and Tone: 
- #### Role: The part the model plays when responding, like being a teacher, helper, or friend.
- #### Tone: The way the model speaks, such as being formal, friendly, or casual.

## Audience and Delivery:
- #### Audience: The people the model is talking to, like kids, adults, or professionals.
- #### Delivery: How the model says things, whether it’s simple, detailed, quick, or slow, depending on who’s listening.

## Chain of Reasoning: 
#### The steps the model takes to explain its answer, showing how it got from the question to the final response, like solving a math problem step by step.

## Giving Examples:
#### Providing specific instances or situations to make the explanation clearer, like saying, "For example, when you..." to help people understand better.
