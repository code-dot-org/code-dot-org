Now you'll make summary tables of the data you collected and cleaned!

**NOTE:** The task below is a kick-off to the next lesson which is a **Practice Performance Task**. You don't *have to* make a chart of the pivot table today - you'll be doing that as part of the next project - but you might experiment.

## Your Task

**Create at least two (2) pivot tables** that show different things about your data.
* With your partner, go back to the data you collected as a class (and which you cleaned up yesterday).
* Practice using pivot tables to group and calculate things you might be interested in.

## Tips

There are two approaches to thinking about what kind of summary table to make:

1. Work backward from a question: Start with a question you want to answer, or a hypothesis about something in the data you think you could reveal. Often the question itself tells you what calculations you need to make.
2. Work forward by experimenting, iterating, and finding something interesting. Start by simply picking a category to group in rows. Then pick a second one to display as values, and try COUNT, AVERAGE, MIN, MAX, etc.  By poking around ideas will come to you for interesting investigations.
