Assume that a variable temperature is assigned like this:

    var temperature = 30;
    
Choose the two (2) Boolean expressions that evaluate to **FALSE**.

**Content: Unit 5 Lesson 9**

The variable temperature is set to 30.

The last two are false.

* (temperature > 0) && (temperature < 32) --> True - 30 is between 0 and 32
* (temperature == 0) || (temperature < 32) --> True - it is the case that 30 is equal to 0 OR 30 is less than 32.
* (temperature != 0) && (temperature < 32)--> True - 30 does not equal 0, and is less than 32.
* (temperature == 0) || (temperature > 32) --> **False** - 30 does not equal 0 nor is it greater than 32.
* (temperature < 0) || (temperature > 32) --> **False** - 30 is not less than 0 nor is it greater than 32.
