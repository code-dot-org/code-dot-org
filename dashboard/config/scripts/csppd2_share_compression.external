## Developing a heuristic for text compression

In lesson 13 students will use a widget to compress short chunks of text. This lesson, which we saw during the in-person professional development, is an opportunity to learn about heuristics, which are rules of thumb that for a general algorithm for solving a problem. Text compression leads to developing a heuristic because the specifics of compressing the text will change as the text being compressed changes, so we need a general principle to follow for compressing the text (for example, looking for patterns of 3 letter combinations that repeat across different words). 

>Let’s start by opening the <a href=https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit1/stage/13/puzzle/2 target=“_blank”>text compression level</a> in another page. **Go through a couple of different poems, and work to develop a heuristic for compressing the text.**

>In the forum, share the following:

>- Your **rules, or heuristic,** for compressing the text
>- How you went about **developing your heuristic**
>- The **highest compression** you achieved (compression rate and poem)

**Once you've posted in the forum, click continue below.**
