# Overview
**Goal:** The purpose of the tasks in levels 3 - 6 is to understand the structure and goals of Unit 4 at a high level.  This context will help you understand the full story arch of the curriculum and prepare you for the activities we have planned to dig deeper in the synchronous meeting. *Estimated time: 30 minutes.*

## Do this: 

* Read the [Unit 4 overview](https://curriculum.code.org/csp-20/unit4/) on the curriculum page.  
* Review the [Planning Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IojBJ1NQPDz4SajskdWq_6LSstg3_9EgpTAwQf63M5g/export?format=pdf) for the Unit 4 project found Unit 4, Lesson 12.
* Pay attention to the role of collaboration in Unit 4 and the project.

In the next two levels, you will see two example “Decision Maker Apps” that show some possibilities of what students are able to create by the end of Unit 4.  You will also use these apps in U4L12 in your own classroom to help students prepare to create their own Decision Maker Apps.  In the next two levels, follow the directions on the screen to analyze the app.
