# What Can You Recall?

Think back to your in-person PD experience.  What do you remember?  Which of these modules did you feel like you had the best experience with?  What was it that made that module feel special?

Take a moment to head over to our discussion area to discuss these answers and more with your fellow teachers.

When you're done, come back and continue with Phase 2 Online.
