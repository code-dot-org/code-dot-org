Consider the following method.

```
public void mystery(int x, int y) {
  if ((x > 0) && (y > 0)) {
    if (x > y) {
      System.out.println("C");
    }
    else {
      System.out.println("O");
    }
  }
  else if ((x < 0) || (y < 0)) {
    System.out.println("D");
  }
  else {
    System.out.println("E");
  }
}
```

What is printed as a result of the call `mystery(3, 4)`?
MARKDOWN

teacher_markdown <<MARKDOWN
Since the `mystery()` method is called with the values `3` and `4`,

* `x = 3`

* `y = 4`

We start by checking the condition `(x > 0) && (y > 0)`. This is `true` because both are greater than `0`.

We then check the condition `x > y`. This is `false` because `3` is not greater than `4`, so the body of the `if` statement is skipped, and the body of the `else` branch is executed. This results in `"O"` being printed to the console.
