# Thinking About Implementation

You may not have finished all the modules yet, but you should have made some progress with both the lessons and the StarLogo Nova tool.

It's time to revisit the implementation of this curriculum.

- Did you get a good feel for how to read the lesson plans?
- Do you understand how to make a model from a description?

> Task: Take one of the modules that you have already completed, but have not done an implementation plan for yet.  With that module in mind, visit this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10CS1cBvU8ejvsVKb3FTeFkhNTeKkvEJGBPYxo5IcZkk/edit?usp=sharing" target="_new">Implementation Document</a> on Google Docs. Create your own copy and fill out each of the segments to get your lesson plan wheels turning.

> If you have already done your Implementation Plan for one module (i.e. Module 1), try completing another to plan out an additional module you can use in your classroom, or revisit your original Implementation Plan and make changes/reflect on it.  

Below, you can see an example of how to create your own copy of the Implementation Document.

When you are finished filling out your implemetation plan, return to this PD and continue to the next phase.
