Check your technology and decide if you need to troubleshoot anything in advance of your Hour of Code.\n\n### One Day Before Your Hour of Code\n\n- Print one or more of the [Exit Ticket examples](https://docs.google.com/a/code.org/document/d/1ylIlO7Pppk6W3Jt58VHS5mjvnshg9URvj3iCU0Ok6qY/edit?usp=sharing) at the end of this lesson plan, or create your own. \n- Each student who completes the activity should receive a [certificate](https://studio.code.org/certificates/batch). Print one for each student in advance to make this easier at the end of your Hour of Code.\n\n - Read the \"Events in Bounce - How Do They Happen?\" slide deck (to be presented to students at end of class).",

They will learn that events are very common in computer programs, especially in video games.\n\nStudents will develop their understanding of events by making a basketball game. Students will learn to make a hand move according to arrow keys, and make noises when objects collide. At the very end, they will get to customize their game to make it more unique!\n",

Here are some ideas:\n\n- **Teach the [Code Studio Computer Science Fundamentals](http://code.org/educate/k5) courses**. These six courses are designed for young learners. Students work their way through a series of puzzles that teach them to code, and educators have access to engaging lesson plans that help make the learning coming alive. Code.org offers free professional development for these courses, online or in-person.\n- **Visit [You can Teach Computer Science](https://code.org/teach)** for more course suggestions.\n- **Invite a computer science expert to talk to your class about his or her work**. Don’t know any local computer scientists? Reach out to a volunteer on our [volunteer map](https://code.org/volunteer/local)\n\n#### Take Me Out to the Ball Game\n\nTake the students outside to play some sort of ball game. Keep track of events and actions. For example, not dribbling in basketball results in a traveling foul and the other team gets the ball. In soccer, kicking the ball out of bounds results in the other team kicking the ball in. Getting the ball to the goal results in a point! Make up more events if your students are into it. Have the all of the students yell \"Yippee\" when the captain of one team scores a point. Have everyone fall to the ground and roll around if a student makes two goals in a row!"
