If you attended a Code.org 5-day workshop during the summer, you should already have this access.\n* If you have not attended a 5-day workshop, you can apply to become verified by [filling out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdGGAJuaDMBVIRYnimPhAL96w6fCl4UdvhwmynGONM75TWwWw/viewform). Note that it may take up to 7 business days to become verified as this is a manual process, so we encourage you to fill out this form as soon as you can. You will receive an email once you are verified.\n* If you do not have a ”verified” teacher account, you can still create a section for your class, but you will not be able to administer the pre-course survey on the first day.\n\n**Do This:** Create a class section on Code Studio.\n* You can either...\n  * Go to the [Code.org How-to Video Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7-6SpcrToamXzSMUKkEYZfKTzi6gJos5) for a video walkthrough of these steps and more on navigating your Code.org account.\n* Or...\n  * Follow these steps to create a section:\n      1. Navigate to My Dashboard\n      2. Click 'New Section' under 'Classroom Sections'\n      3. Choose 'Email Logins'\n            * If logged on through Google you can choose to sync to your Google Classroom.\n      4. Give your section a name, and choose the most appropriate grade level of students in your class\n      5. Set the course to be \"AP CSA\"\n      6.
