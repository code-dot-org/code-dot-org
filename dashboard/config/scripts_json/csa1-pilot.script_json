If using this option, refer to the Personal Symbol Project 1 Day Lesson Plan, which includes a one-day version of the Personal Symbol Project Planning Guide. Direct students to develop their program on Lesson 18 so they can submit their project. While the one-day option covers the learning objectives and goals, it shortens planning and reflection time.
