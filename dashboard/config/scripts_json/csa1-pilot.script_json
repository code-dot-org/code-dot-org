They annotate the question as a class, then implement a full `SpiralPainter` class in pairs through an \"Around the World\" style activity.\n\nThe goals of this lesson are threefold: \n* Create a sense of excitement and accomplishment around completing FRQs\n* Practice an FRQ style question (written by hand)\n* Serve as a summative assessment of the content from Unit 1\n\nWhile the format of this FRQ is not the same as an FRQ on the AP exam, it is a building block to help students prepare to tackle these types of questions. As students progress through the course, the FRQ questions they encounter slowly become closer to the real thing.\n",
        "preparation": "* Read through the Print Outs document, which contains setup instructions for the \"Around the World\" activity.\n* Print out the station instructions and the manipulatives in the Print Outs document.\n* Cut out the manipulatives.\n* Optional: For each student, provide a blue, orange, and pink colored pencil or marker.\n",

You may choose to use a five or ten-minute timer to help students pace themselves (though it is helpful to recognize that some of these tasks may take longer than others). If students are unable to complete a part, you may want to suggest:\n* Write comments for each \"Do this\" item necessary to complete the task.\n* Return to the manipulatives and trace through their pseudocode again.\n\nDifferentiation Suggestions:\n* Tell pairs who may need more time on each part that they need two signatures instead of three.  They should complete the constructor and choose one of the methods (`paintL()` or `paintSpiral()`)\n* Encourage those who finish early to write full responses in their reflections and serve as reviewers checking off their peers’ code and giving helpful suggestions (like completing a formal code review).\n"
