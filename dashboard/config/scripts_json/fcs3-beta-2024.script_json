Since we trained our model only on fruits and vegetables, it doesn’t work very well on other types of foods. If we wanted to improve our model, we’d probably need a lot more data and a lot more features - more than just how sweet and easy-to-eat food is. This gets a lot harder for us as humans to understand, and we couldn’t use our graph paper anymore. Luckily, computers can help us with this!

Students should be using the cross-tab visualizations to make decisions about which features are useful for making recommendations, noticing when features have strong relationships and when features appear “random”. Help students see that choosing all the features or choosing features at random isn’t useful if it leads to an inaccurate model.\n\n**Order Matters**: Students may discover that the order they select their features can sometimes matter - for example, choosing \"peppers, fried chicken\" may end up with different accuracy than \"fried chicken, peppers\". This is not a vital topic for using AI Lab fluently, and happens more often in these early levels because of the smaller dataset sizes. If students ask, one way to think about it is that the first feature represents how AI Bot first tries to separate the data before continuing on to the other features. Therefore: the stronger the relationship is with the first feature you pick, the stronger the patterns AI Bot will find."

Why or why not?_\n\n**Discussion Goal:** This is an opportunity to explore how demographic features, like gender or race or age, should or shouldn't be used in machine learning models. Some students may think it's harmless to include gender in the survey, since it may have a strong relation to certain types of books. Other students may bring up how about gender can lead to stereotypes, or how there may not be enough data to be gender inclusive in the survey especially for non-binary students.\n\nGuide students to consider whether or not it feels like the best type of question to ask considering that the class is trying to predict a book recommendation. Have the class consider whether gender feels like a necessary question, or if other questions will also lead to accurate recommendations. In this way, asking about gender is similar to the previous two questions about which sandwich you like or the type of day you're having: the other questions are probably better predictors of what type of book you may read.",

Later on, they can continue to customize their app with Design Mode\n- **Level 5:** Students add a home screen to their app. The instructions for this level may be difficult to keep track of - encourage students to “check off” each step as they complete it. They can also use the animated example on the level as a guide for how to complete this task.\n- **Level 6:** Students add a button from the home screen to the predict screen, and add an event to connect the two screens together. Support students in reading through the instructions and “checking off” each piece as they go along. They can also click the “Show Me How” lines in the instructions for screenshots of what each step can look like.",

The process is identical to selecting features, but be aware that some students may be initially surprised by this extra step in the process.  Students can access a resource in the Help and Tips section of Code Studio that explains how to select a label in AI Lab\n\n**Revisiting Past Screens:** Let students know it’s okay to go back and revisit past screens to improve their model or make different decisions - this is an important part of the process and something students should practice in this level. Students may find themselves starting to move fluently between the testing, feature, and label screens as they refine and improve their machine learning model.\n\n**Level 2 - Where Are The Tables?** In level 2, students predict the type of animal that they are looking at (like mammal, reptile, etc). This column has too many possible values, and so many data visualization tables won't appear. This is intentional, since it challenges students to use feature iteration and the Previous Results screens intentionally to find features that work. They need to trust that, if there are patterns in the data, AI Bot will find them and produce an accurate model even when there's too much data to visualize. This also prepares students for more realistic examples where there are typically more than 4 or 5 values for a feature.\n\n**Accuracy and Data Representation**: Students may be able to discover some curious combinations that give 100% accuracy. This may be because the particular features they chose are not well represented in the dataset - for example, only 8 out of the 100 animals are considered Venomous. This could lead to inflated accuracy, especially if those animals are not well represented in the testing set. If you notice students training models like this, ask them to thoroughly test their models and compare the results to their real-world experiences to make sure the model matches reality. Remind them that just because a model has high accuracy on its testing data doesn't mean it will have high accuracy in the real world."

Help students keep track of the new text input element they add to the temperature screen, and make sure the ID of the element matches the one they use in the [`getText`(#fff176)](/docs/applab/getText/) block of their code.\n- **Level 7:** Students update both the design and the code of their app to collect data for the Time of Day feature.
