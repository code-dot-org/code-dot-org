In this lesson, students revisit overloaded constructors and learn how overloading can be applied to methods. They explore how overloaded methods work and consider scenarios where overloaded methods would be useful. Students then practice writing and calling overloaded methods and revisit their Need to Knows to determine what they have learned that will be useful for their project and what they still need to learn.",

Additionally, you must be a* ***verified teacher*** *to run Java Lab code. If you attended a Code.org 5-day workshop during the summer, you should already have this access.*\n\nTo check if you have access:\n1. Navigate to the [**Unit 1 Overview**](https://studio.code.org/s/csa1).\n2. Do you see the **CSA Pre-Course Survey** at the top of the unit overview page?\n3. If not, you need to verify your teacher account. Please fill out [**this form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdGGAJuaDMBVIRYnimPhAL96w6fCl4UdvhwmynGONM75TWwWw/viewform). Note that it can take 5-7 business days to become a verified teacher, so please do this step early!\n4. If you are *not* a verified teacher account, you can still create a section for your class, but you will not be able to administer the pre-course survey on the first day, and your students will not be able to run code in Java Lab.\n\n**Do This:** Create a class section on Code Studio.\n\n1. Navigate to [**My Dashboard**](https://studio.code.org/home).\n2. Click **New section** under **Classroom Sections**.\n3. Choose **Email Logins**.\n   * If you are logged in through Google, you can choose to sync to your Google Classroom.\n4. Give your section a name, and choose the most appropriate grade level of students in your class.\n5. Set the course to be **CSA**.\n6.
