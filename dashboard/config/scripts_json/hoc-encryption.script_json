        "overview": "In this lesson, students are introduced to the need for encryption and simple techniques for breaking (or cracking) secret messages.  Students try their own hand at cracking a message encoded with the classic Caesar cipher and also a Random Substitution Cipher.  Students should become well-acquainted with idea that in an age of powerful computational tools, techniques of encryption will need to be more sophisticated.  The most important aspect of this lesson is to understand how and why encryption plays a role in all of our lives every day on the Internet, and that making good encryption is not trivial.  Students will get their feet wet with understanding the considerations that must go into making strong encryption in the face of powerful computational tools that can be used to crack it. The need for secrecy when sending bits over the Internet is important for anyone using the Internet.",

        "purpose": "“Encryption” is a process for transforming a message so that the original is “hidden” from anyone who is not the intended recipient. Encryption is not just for the military and spies anymore. We use encryption everyday on the Internet, primarily to conduct commercial transactions, and without it our economy might grind to a halt. \r\n\r\nThis lesson gives students a first taste of the kind of thinking that goes into encrypting messages in the face of computational tools. Computational tools dramatically increase the strength and complexity of the algorithms we use to encrypt information, but these same tools also increase our ability to crack an encryption. Developing strong encryption relies on knowledge of problems that are “hard” for computers to solve, and using that knowledge to encrypt messages. As a resource, you may wish to read all of Chapter 5 of *Blown to Bits*.  It provides social context which you may want to bring to your classroom.",

So click on things, poke around.\r\n * If you figure it out you might be able to crack a message encoded with random substitution.\r\n\r\n![](csp/U4L05-freqanalysis-screencap.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n* **After some exploration time regroup** to clarify what the tool is and how it works.\r\n\r\n* **If necessary** point out to students that the next level in code studio (the one after the frequency analysis tool) explains a little bit about how frequency analysis works and suggests a few strategies for how to get started. \r\n\r\n**Give students about 15-20 minutes to crack one of the messages.**\r\n\r\n* If they finish there are more to try.  \r\n* Students can enter their own messages, do a random substitution to encrypt it, then copy/paste the encrypted version and see if a friend can crack it. \r\n* It is possible to get pretty proficient at cracking these messages with the tool."

        "description": "As part of wrap up **the major points we want to draw out are:**\n\n* Encryption is essential for every day life and activity\n* The \"strength\" of encryption is related to how easy it is to crack a message, assuming adversary  knows the technique but not the exact \"key\"\n* A random substitution cipher is very crackable by hand though it might take some time, trial and error.\n* However, when aided with computational tools, a random substitution cipher can be cracked by a novice in a matter of minutes.\n* Simple substitution ciphers give insight into encryption algorithms, but as we've seen fall way short when a potential adversary is aided with computational tools...our understanding must become more sophisticated.\n* If we are to create a secure Internet, we will need to develop tools and protocols which can resist the enormous computational power of modern computers.\n\n\nHere are a couple of thought-provoking prompts you can use to bring closure to the lesson and as an avenue to draw out the points above.  Choose one or more.\n\n**Prompts:**\n\n**How much easier is it to crack a caesar cipher than a random substitution cipher?  Can you put a number on it?**\n\n* *For Caesar's Cipher there are only 25 possible ways to shift the alphabet.  Worst case, you only need to try 25 different possibilites.  A random substitution cipher has MANY more possibilities (26 factorial = 4x10 <sup>26</sup> possibilities).  However, as we learned, with frequency analysis we can avoid having to try all of them blindly.*\n\n**Was it difficult to crack a Random Substitution cipher? Did it take longer than you thought? shorter? Why?**\n\n* *Computational tools aid humans in the implementation of encryption, decryption, and cracking algorithms. In other words, using a computer changes the speed and complexity of the types of encryption we can do, but it also increases our ability to break or circumvent encryption.*\n\n**Any encryption cipher is an algorithm** for transforming plaintext into ciphertext.  What about the other way around? Can you write out an algorithm for cracking a Ceasar cipher? What about a random substitution cipher?**\n\n * *An algorithm for cracking a Caesar cipher is pretty easy - for each possible alphabetic shift, try it, see if the words come out as english.*\n * *An algorithm for cracking random substitution is trickier and more nunanced.  There might not be a single great answer but through thinking about it you realize how tricky it is to codify human intelligence and intuition for doing something like frequency analysis into a process that a machine can follow. It probably requires some human intervention which is an interesting point to make.*\n\n   \n**Review of Terminology -- you can use this opportunity to review new vocabulary introduced in the activity and respond to questions students may have encountered during the activity.**\n\n  * Definitions of cryptography, encryption, decryption, cracking/breaking an encryption, cipher, etc.",
