Some ideas on how to do this are: \n\n - Utilize ***Pair Programming**  - student video whenever possible.\n - Encourage students with questions/challenges to start by asking their partner.\n - Unanswered questions can be escalated to a nearby group, who might already know the solution.\n - Remind students to use the debugging process before you approach.\n - Have students describe the problem that they’re seeing. What is it supposed to do? What does it do? What does that tell you?\n - Remind frustrated students that frustration is a step on the path to learning, and that persistence will pay off.\n - If a student is still stuck after all of this, ask leading questions to get the student to spot an error on their own."

During online activities, the role of the teacher is primarily one of encouragement and support. Online lessons are meant to be student-centered, so teachers should avoid stepping in when students get stuck. Some ideas on how to do this are: \n\n - Utilize ***Pair Programming** whenever possible\n - Encourage students with questions/challenges to start by asking their partner\n - Unanswered questions can be escalated to a nearby group, who might already know the solution\n - Remind students to use the debugging process before you approach\n - Have students describe the problem that they’re seeing. What is it supposed to do? What does it do? What does that tell you?\n - Remind frustrated students that frustration is a step on the path to learning, and that persistence will pay off.\n - If a student is still stuck after all of this, ask leading questions to get the student to spot an error on their own."

We suggest:\n\t- Counting to 10\n\t- Singing “Old MacDonald”\n- Once their plan is underway, interject button presses sporadically.\n- Continue the blend until they understand the difference between actions that are guided by a plan and those that are event driven."

As they do so, have them touch on what the planning-to-coding experience was like for them. \n* **Pair Storytelling**: If you have a big class or are shorter on time, have students or groups pair up and demo their projects that way. \n* **Gallery Walk**: Ensure all students have their projects ready for testing. Have students move \"musical chairs\"-style to another computer and run the project there and read the story. When they receive a signal from you, they should move to another computer.
