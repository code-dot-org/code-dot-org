Interactive models and simulations are used in the real world to help engineers and scientists identify patterns, understand nature, make predictions about future changes, and design solutions to prepare for and/or combat major disruptions. \n\nStudents will explore examples of evolution, adaptation, migration, natural selection, and survival in groups. The lesson concludes with a creative project where students create a hypothesis for a potential future aquatic animal adaptation to survive overfishing.\n",

First you’ll add code to count the number of fish caught by the boat and stop the boat from catching more fish once it reaches its limit. Then, you will limit the area in which the boat is allowed to fish. Third, you’ll create a fishing season and a no fishing season to allow the fish time to recover.

If the program isn’t doing what they expected, ask the student to first tell you what they want to happen, click run to observe what is actually happening, then find the place in their code that caused the discrepancy. Remember to celebrate finding bugs and fixing bugs. Getting a bug means students are doing a great job building a more complex program. "
