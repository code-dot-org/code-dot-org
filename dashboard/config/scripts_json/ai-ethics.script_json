Afterward, each group develops at least one solution-oriented principle that addresses their chosen area.

        "purpose": "AI (artificial intelligence) is quickly, and in many ways quietly, becoming pervasive in our modern world. While we have not yet arrived at a “general” or “strong” AI capable of “thinking” like we do, recent technologies utilizing “narrow” or “weak” AI have made inroads in nearly every part of our daily lives. From healthcare and finance to social networks and virtual assistants, special-purpose AI has expanded into our economic, biological, political, and cultural contexts far more than most of us  realize. Although AI has given us advances in efficiency, insight, and even entertainment, the use of AI can also result in problematic outcomes such as bias and misinformation. It is critical that everyone is aware of the pitfalls of AI in order to ensure that all current and future AI, be it narrow or general, serves us all.",
