Here are a few tips that should help students regardless of the level they're working on.\n\n* **Checking Correctness:** This tutorial will not tell students whether they completed the level correctly. It is possible to skip through the different parts of the activity quickly. Encourage students to watch the videos, read the instructions, and try different things along the way. At any time, they can share their findings with you or a classmate.\n* **Collaborate with Neighbors:** Encourage students to check in with a neighbor to discuss what they are experiencing. Since this tutorial includes videos and students may be wearing headphones it can get easy to \"go into a bubble\". Help break those barriers by actively pairing students.\n* **Read the Instructions:** The instructions usually provide helpful information about what is happening behind the scenes. \n* **Go back and try different things:** If students finish quickly, encourage them to go back to \"Train More\". In the last part of the activity, students can also go back and choose a \"New Word\". More training data tends to make the machine learning model more accurate and consistent. Students can also learn by purposefully training their model incorrectly, or not training it at all.",
