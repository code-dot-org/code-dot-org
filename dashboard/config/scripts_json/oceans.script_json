        "overview": "In this lesson, learners of all ages get an introductory experience with coding and computer science in a safe, supportive environment. First, students classify objects as either \"fish\" or \"not fish\" to attempt to remove trash from the ocean. Then, students will need to expand their training data set to include other sea creatures that belong in the water. In the second part of the activity, students will choose their own labels to apply to images of randomly generated fish. This training data is used for a machine learning model that should then be able to label new images on its own.",

Check your technology and decide if you need to troubleshoot anything in advance of your Hour of Code.\n\n### One Day Before Your Hour of Code\n\n- Each student who completes the activity should receive a certificate.

        "description": "**Motivate:** Explain to students the goals of today's activity. They are going to start using a new tool that will let them train a real machine learning model, a form of artificial intelligence. \n\n**General Support:** As a teacher your role is primarily to support students as they make their way through the tutorial. Here are a few tips that should help students regardless of the level they're working on.\n\n* **Checking Correctness:** This tutorial will not tell students whether they completed the level correctly. It is possible to skip through the different parts of the activity quickly. Encourage students to watch the videos, read the instructions, and try different things along the way. At any time, they can share their findings with you or a classmate.\n* **Collaborate with Neighbors:** Encourage students to check in with a neighbor to discuss what they are experiencing. Since this tutorial includes videos and students may be wearing headphones it can get easy to \"go into a bubble\". Help break those barriers by actively pairing students.\n* **Read the Instructions:** The instructions usually provide helpful information about what is happening behind the scenes. \n* **Go back and try different things:** If students finish quickly, encourage them to go back to \"Train More\". In the last part of the activity, students can also go back and choose a \"New Word\". More training data tends to make the machine learning model more accurate and consistent. Students can also learn by purposefully training their model incorrectly, or not training it at all.\n**Video:** [AI: Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeU5m6vRyCk) The first level of this activity is a video that gives important context around artificial intelligence and machine learning. Watch it as a class and debrief afterwards to help students build connections to the content.",

The words in this list are intentionally more subjective than what students have seen so far. Encourage students to decide for themselves what makes a fish look \"angry\" or \"fun\". Two students may choose the same label and get a very different set of results based on which fish traits were their focus. Encourage students to discuss their findings with each other or go back and choose new words. Each student will rely on their own opinions to train A.I. which means that A.I. will learn with the same biases held by the students. As students begin to see the role their opinion is playing, ask them to reflect on whether this is good or bad, and how it might be addressed.\n\n**Open question:** *What is a problem you care about that artificial intelligence could help to solve?*",
