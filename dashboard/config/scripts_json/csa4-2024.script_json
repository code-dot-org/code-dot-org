        "description": "The unit assessment project assesses proficiency in the knowledge and skills developed in this unit. It is completed in three class periods to plan and create the program, including reading and analyzing data and creating a drawing or animation to visualize the data. Students participate in planning and feedback activities to solve problems, reinforce software development practices and self-image as software engineers, and improve their programs.\n\nIf there is not enough time for the three-day project, a one-day option achieves the targeted learning objectives and goals. If using this option, refer to the [**Abstract Data Art Project 1-Day Lesson Plan**](https://studio.code.org/s/csa4-2023/lessons/15). While the one-day option covers the learning objectives and goals, it shortens planning and reflection time. Consider this tradeoff when deciding which version to use."
