        "description": "### Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy\n\n\n* **New Topics, Same Classroom Culture:** This unit is students' first experience with programming. It is designed to maintain the collaborative and inclusive classroom environment developed in the previous two units. The collaborative project, fun, unplugged activities, and the focus on experimenting should help keep your whole class working together and trying out ideas. \n\n* **Emphasizing Skills:** Since this is the first of many programming units, it emphasizes attitudes and skills that will serve your students well for the remainder of the year. The project that runs through this unit emphasizes that programming is a creative and collaborative endeavor that students can use to help others. Key practices like pair programming and debugging help normalize working with a partner, asking for help, and making mistakes. While students have a lot to learn about programming and App Lab, there is just as much emphasis on establishing these positive habits and mindsets. \n\n* **Empowering \"Creators\":** This unit empowers students to be creators with a major emphasis on making personally meaningful apps. Students have a lot to learn about programming. Still, the goal is for students to come away from this unit, seeing programming as a powerful form of personal expression that allows them to draw on their innate talents and interests to help solve problems in their community.\n\n### Major Assessment and Projects\n\nThe unit project asks students to collaborate with a classmate to design an app that can teach others about a topic of shared interest. Students practice interviewing classmates to identify the project's goals, mockup designs, collaboratively program the app and run simple user tests. The app itself must include at least three screens and demonstrate what students have learned about user interface design and event-driven programming. Students submit their app, project guide, and written responses to reflection questions about how the app is designed and the development process used to make it. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n\n### AP Connections\n\nThis unit and unit project helps build towards the enduring understandings listed below. For a detailed mapping of units to Learning Objectives and EKs, please see the \"Standards\" page for this unit.\n\n* CRD-1: incorporating multiple perspectives through collaboration improves computing innovations as they are developed.\n* CRD-2: developers create and innovate using an iterative design process that is user-focused, that incorporates implementation/feedback cycles, and that leaves ample room for experimentation and risk-taking.\n* AAP-2: The way statements are sequenced and combined in a program determines the computed result. Programs incorporate iteration and selection constructs to represent repetition and make decisions to handle varied input values.\n* AAP-3: Programmers break down problems into smaller and more manageable pieces. By creating procedures and leveraging parameters, programmers generalize processes that can be reused. Procedures allow programmers to draw upon existing code that has already been tested, allowing them to write programs more quickly and with more confidence.\n\nThis unit includes content from the following topics from the AP CS Principles Framework. For more detailed information on topic coverage in the course review [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dqYF5u0AULjw049gaCwAP34ZSe0VuEWbAjWoH1-YMW0/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n* 1.1 Collaboration\n* 1.2 Program Function and Purpose\n* 1.3 Program Design and Development\n\nThe College Board has supplied formative Create PT questions to help prepare students to complete the Create Task. We recommend that students complete the following prompts with the unit project. More information can be found in Code.org CS Principles Topic Coverage.\n\n* 3.a.i.\n* 3.a.ii.\n* 3.a.iii\n"

While specific answers aren't important, you should push them to build on their experiences in the main activity. For example, if they saw that words having two meanings was confusing in the main activity, they should suggest redesigning the language so each word has a single well-understood meaning. \n\n"

That's a little different than how things work in App Lab where it is possible to write code that may not run at all. Encourage students that this is ok.

        "description": "Great job today! You've learned a lot so far about programs. It's important to remember that programs need to work for a variety of inputs and outputs. That's what makes programming interactive apps so fun! Today, you also learned how to describe the behavior of a program, or how the program works when it's run and how the user interacts with it. \r\n\r\nWhen we talk about how programs run, we can describe both what the program does and specifically how the program statements accomplish this goal. \t\r\n\r\nWe're going to keep practicing using these words and going forward you're going to get more chance to practice programming. Start thinking about how you might want to use what you learned today in your project.",

This shows that code may have no warnings but still is not working correctly.\n\n**Level 4:** Again this code has no warnings but in testing the app students should see that the range of values for the random numbers is too large. Iterative testing with different values should help them pick a number that keeps the smiley inside the screen.\n\n**Level 5:** In this level an entire event handler is missing. Students will need to add it to the app.\n\n**Level 6:** This level explicitly introduces the fact that event handlers ([`onEvent`(#fff176)](/docs/applab/onEvent/)) should not go inside other [`onEvent`(#fff176)](/docs/applab/onEvent/) blocks.
