During online activities, the role of the teacher is primarily one of encouragement and support. Online lessons are meant to be student-centered, so teachers should avoid stepping in when students get stuck. Some ideas on how to do this are: \r\n\r\n - Utilize pair programming whenever possible during the activity.\r\n - Encourage students with questions/challenges to start by asking their partner.\r\n - Unanswered questions can be escalated to a nearby group, who might already know the solution.\r\n - Remind students to use the debugging process before you approach.\r\n - Have students describe the problem that they’re seeing. What is it supposed to do? What does it do? What does that tell you?\r\n - Remind frustrated students that frustration is a step on the path to learning, and that persistence will pay off.\r\n - If a student is still stuck after all of this, ask leading questions to get the student to spot an error on their own."

        "description": "Students should now be ready to see a real puzzle in action!\n    \n**Model:** Pull up Puzzle 5 to do in front of the class. This will be the same puzzle that they just saw in the bridging activity. While working through this puzzle with the class, remind students that making mistakes is okay and remind them that the only way to be successful is to be persistent. Tie the the issues into ideas that they've seen in previous lessons, such as what to do when a program doesn't work (debug it!) or how to get through the frustration that can come with working on a computer.\n\nNext, you'll need to describe how the blocks in the workspace move the bird toward the pig.  Show students how to drag blocks from the toolbox and connect them beneath the `when run` block, but don't solve the puzzle.\n\n**Discuss:** Think about how we would get the bird to the pig using arrows.  How do we use these blocks instead?\n\nHave students use their fingers to point the direction that the bird should go next.  Once you feel like you have a classroom consensus, try to get students to put into words which block will make that action happen.  Roll your mouse over different options and have them shout \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nDrag blocks into place one at a time, then click \"Run\" after each one.  This will not only let them see how far the bird has gone, but set good habits for when they start working to solve their own puzzles.\n\nContinue this pattern, fixing bugs as they arise, until the bird successfully gets to the pig.\n\n**Transition:** Now that students have seen an online puzzle in practice, they should be ready to start solving puzzles of their own.  Continue to the lab or bring out their classroom machines."

Some ideas on how to do this are: \n\n - Utilize ***Pair Programming** - student video whenever possible during the activity.\n - Encourage students with questions/challenges to start by asking their partner.\n - Unanswered questions can be escalated to a nearby group, who might already know the solution.\n - Have students describe the problem that they’re seeing. What is it supposed to do? What does it do? What does that tell you?\n - Remind frustrated students that frustration is a step on the path to learning, and that persistence will pay off.\n - If a student is still stuck after all of this, ask leading questions to get the student to spot an error on their own.\n\n**Discuss:** After providing students with end-of-class warnings, grab everyone's attention and get them to reflect on the experiences that they just had.\n\n - Did anyone feel frustrated during any of the puzzles?\n - Did anyone notice the need to be persistent?\n\n**Transition:** Have students grab their Reflection Journals and take a moment to review lessons for themselves."

Explain your answer. \n\n\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: Show “Think about it” slide\n\n**Say:** These pictures in the timeline represent different forms of transportation. People used to travel by horse and carriage before the invention of the car. Now people mostly travel in cars. Did you know some car companies just invented a car that can drive itself? It’s called a self-driving car or autonomous vehicle.\n\n**Discuss:** What problem did each of these inventions solve?\n\n**Discussion Goal:** Students should understand that each of these images represents a technological advancement in travel. As our technology advances, we are able to create more efficient means of transportation. The horse and carriage replaced walking or traveling on horseback and being exposed to the elements. Cars replaced having to rely on animals for transportation. Self-driving cars replace the need for a human driver with the goal to be safer than human-driven cars.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: Show “Fill-in-the-blank” slide\n\n**Say:** Look at the two pictures on the top of the screen and see if you can figure out which of the 3 apps at the bottom would come next.

Why might someone choose to play music on a piano and not a music app?\n\n**Discussion Goal:** Students should understand that a music app represents an advancement in computing technology. We now have the ability to play any song we want on demand from our phone or computer. A radio can only play stations that are currently broadcasting. And a piano can only play piano music (and only if the person knows how to play).\n\nSomeone might choose to play music from a piano when they want to play music themselves or for a live audience. They also might prefer the sound of piano music or wish to learn a new instrument.\n\n",

I would need to program the character to only move when I put my finger on the screen of my phone.\n\t\t- Putting my finger on the screen would then become an \"event\" that tells my character to move.\n\n**Say**: _In earlier lessons, we created algorithms that allowed us to control a friend or bird for several steps at a time. It was fun and useful, but what happens when you don’t know everything that you want your friend to do in advance?

We suggest:\n\t- Pink Button -> Say “Wooooo!”\n\t- Teal Button -> “Yeah!”\n\t- Purple Dial -> “Boom!”\n- Practice tapping the buttons on the overhead and having your class react.\n- Add some button sequences into the mix and have the students try to keep up with their sounds.\n- Let your class know that every time you push a button, it is an “event” that lets them know what they are expected to do next.\n- Have students practice working backwards. Give them 3-4 sounds and ask what buttons they would need to press to get the sounds to play in that order. For example:\n\t- What buttons would you need to press to get \"Boom! Boom! Yeah!\"?\n- Get the class started on a planned task before interrupting them again with the buttons. We suggest:\n\t- Counting to 10\n\t- Singing “Old MacDonald”\n- Once their plan is underway, interject button presses sporadically.\n- Continue the blend until they understand the difference between actions that are guided by a plan and those that are event driven.\n\n"

Students will examine how cause and effect can be seen in animals as you view the behavioral patterns of offspring (the cause) to determine how to increase the offspring’s survival (the effect).\n\n*Standards Addressed:*\n\n- **CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.SL.1.1:** Participate in collaborative conversations with diverse partners about grade 1 topics and texts with peers and adults in small and larger groups.\n\n- **CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.SL.1.4:** Describe people, places, things, and events with relevant details, expressing ideas and feelings clearly.\n\n- **CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.1.G.A.1:** Distinguish between defining attributes (e.g., triangles are closed and three-sided) versus non-defining attributes (e.g., color, orientation, overall size); build and draw shapes to possess defining attributes.\n\n- **NGSS.1-LS1-2:** Read texts and use media to determine patterns in behavior of parents and offspring that help offspring survive. [Clarification Statement: Examples of patterns of behaviors could include the signals that offspring make (such as crying, cheeping, and other vocalizations) and the responses of the parents (such as feeding, comforting, and protecting the offspring).]"

This can be done in many ways, but here are a few:\n\n* **Public Demo**: Select a few exemplary volunteers to briefly demo their projects in front of the class. As they do so, have them touch on what the planning-to-coding experience was like for them, including ideas they'd still like to implement. \n* **Pair Playtesting**: Have students or groups pair up and playtest each other's projects. As they do, ask them to provide positive and constructive feedback to each other. The benefit here is that students will have the opportunity to provide and respond to feedback in a smaller setting. \n* **Gallery Walk**: Ensure all students have their projects ready for testing. Have students move \"musical chairs\"-style to another computer and playtest the project there for a few minutes, until they receive a signal from you to move to another computer. Repeat this every few minutes. While there is less opportunity for structured communication here, this ensures students get to demo as many of their peers' projects as possible.",
