Students are then shown the four steps of the problem-solving process and work together to relate these abstract steps to their actual experiences solving problems. First students relate these steps to the problem activities from the previous lesson, then a problem they are good at solving, then a problem they want to improve at solving.

Make groups of 2 or 3 you know need to be together and then figure out which groups can't be at the same table. \r\n\r\nThis isn't the only approach to the problem, and you shouldn't rush to introduce it as such. Rather, encourage students to discuss with one another what they know needs to be true at the end and whether different approaches might help.\r\n\r\n**Draw Pictures:** Students will likely do better if they draw pictures. You may wish for students to use a journal or scratch paper as a place to brainstorm ideas.\r\n\r\n**Extending the Problem:** If one group finishes far before others you could give them a blank sheet of paper and ask them to solve the problem again but with a new condition of your choosing (e.g. pick two people sitting at the same table in their solution and ask whether they can solve the problem now that those two people are also in a fight.)\r\n"

Rather than asking students to choose a different project, consider asking students to imagine a more scaled-down version of their initial idea. As an analogy, if students initial idea is the \"Run\" step, imagine a less intense version that represents what the \"Walk\" step would look like.

On the left side they can make a rough sketch of what their app would look like. This does not need to be a final draft and is just there to help them brainstorm ideas and communicate to another group how their app would look. On the right side they have space to label each individual piece of information on the screen.\n\nUsing the outputs that students selected as a guide, students should pick the inputs they'll need to create them. Only 6 spaces are provided though students could opt to choose more. This is somewhat intentional to help students scope the functionality of their app.\n\nStudents will describe the way their app processes data using as a model the way they would process it themselves. The goal here is primarily just to ensure students have selected inputs that could be processed to produce the outputs. For example, if they're finding a list of friends with birthdays this month then both a computer and human would need to know a list of friends' birthdays and the current month.\n\nLastly students are asked to decide what information, if any, it makes sense to store long term.\n\n**Distribute:** Apps and Problem Solving - Peer Review, one copy to each pair of students\n\n**Step 7: Peer Review**: Each group should trade their project guides with another. They should fill out the first line of the peer review which asks what specific part of their project they'd like feedback on. Afterward, there are a number of directed questions as well as a chance to provide more open-ended feedback on the idea.\n\nStudents should be given their project guides back as well as their peer feedback. On the back, there are questions where they can indicate what changes or improvements to their projects they intend to make on their apps based on the feedback."

Note that the instructions for administering an assessment and a survey are the same.    \n\n**How much time does it take?** The survey does take some time - it is roughly 30 questions.  You might consider administering it on an admin day at school, or as an early homework.\n\n**When should I give the survey?** Because it is a pre-course survey it is important that students take it as early in the course as possible before they have had much (or any) exposure to the class so that we may accurately gauge changes in attitudes and beliefs caused by the course.",

If it doesn't arise naturally as you leave the conversation offer some or all of the ideas mentioned in the discussion goals.\n\n**Discussion Goal:** Students have practiced using the problem-solving process on a number of different problems. Help them synthesize the notes they have been keeping to better understand the role of each step and the value of the problem-solving process in general. A sample set of conclusions is below but you should allow students to share your own insights before offering your own.\n\n**Define:** without defining a problem you might solve the wrong problem, not know where to start, or not know when you're finished\n\n**Prepare:** Even well-defined problems usually have many possible approaches. Make each try more likely to succeed by first examining your options and anticipating challenges\n\n**Try:** Without trying you'll never get anywhere. It's important to be persistent and patient so long as your plan still may work\n\n**Reflect:** You'll likely not solve the problem the first time or there will be a better way to solve it.
