Sprite Lab is an open-ended coding environment that uses block-based code. Students will learn the basics of Sprite Lab throughout this lesson to plan and build their Tour Guide app in the following lessons. \n\nIn this integrated lesson, students learn social studies concepts by creating a map with code. To begin, students will examine several examples of maps and discuss what features make up the map. In the wrap-up, students will discuss the role of a map maker. \n",
        "preparation": "- Review and complete the online tutorial yourself.\n- Review slides and decide on pacing between student work time and whole group instruction.\n- Prepare sticky notes or scratch paper for each student in the wrap-up discussion.\n- Check your technology and decide if you need to troubleshoot anything in advance.\n\n#####Optional:\n- [Optional] Review this [Helpful Hints](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RSJhxO9ZMtyLrt160kvAVdyekR4wT2fVSgbrPHR4HS0/template/preview) slideshow. \n- [Optional] Review this [teacher’s guide to debugging](https://code.org/curriculum/docs/k-5/DebuggingTeacher.pdf) to be prepared to help students find and fix errors in their code. \n- [Optional] Pair Programming - Decide if you want students to engage in pair programming. Watch this [video](https://youtu.be/sxToW3ixrwo) and visit this [Support](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/115002122788-How-does-pair-programming-on-Code-org-work-) page for more information about pair programming.\n- [Optional] Custom Sprite Uploads - Though this will be introduced in later lessons, you can choose to teach students how to upload their own sprite costumes and backgrounds with this video. \n",

They might infer that this is a map in a video game based on the style and “Press Spacebar to Continue” sign. There are no boundaries; instead, the map has a Start and Finish point with town names along the route. Explain to students that this depicts a map made during the USA’s “westward expansion” and before there were state boundaries. \n\n_Note: This map is from the popular 1990s video game “The Oregon Trail” in which players travel a 2,000-mile overland route through current-day Idaho and Oregon with their families, wagons, and animals. The game is set between 1840-1860._\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** \"Map 3: Exploring Maps\" Slide\n\n**Discuss:** \n- What do the colors mean in this map? \n- Why are there both color boundaries and state boundaries? \n- What does the mapmaker want to teach us about this part of North America?\n\n**Discussion Goal:** Students will start to recognize that map makers have much to consider when designing a new map. The use of color can help distinguish different boundaries and provide focus. The colors in this map indicate different Native American tribal regions pre-colonization. The mapmaker overlapped current state boundaries to show the change of “borders” over time between two groups of people. Maps change over time as new features are discovered, as geography or boundaries change, and as the purpose of the map changes. \n"

For example, the Statue of Liberty in New York City is a famous American landmark because it’s a symbol that represents freedom and democracy. It’s as big as a 22-story building, and people worldwide come to see it! The Statue of Liberty reminds us that everyone should have the freedom to be who they are and do what they want. \n\nAnother example of a landmark is the 81-story-tall Eiffel Tower in Paris, France. The Eiffel Tower is important because it’s a symbol of France and its culture. It was built over 130 years ago for a big event called the World's Fair, and it was supposed to be taken down afterward, but people liked it so much that they decided to keep it! \n\nThese are examples of two famous landmarks in the world. However, a landmark can be something as simple as a special tree or a local library. It’s your turn to write down as many ideas as possible of landmarks you might want to add to your map. Now is just a time to brainstorm, so don’t worry about choosing which ones you’ll use until later. ",

Debugging is like fixing a puzzle by looking at what went wrong and figuring out how to fix it.\n\nTo debug, you need to be patient and try different things until you find a solution. Just like playing with a puzzle, you need to keep trying until everything fits perfectly. Debugging is a way to make sure that everything works the way it should, and it's an important skill for anyone who wants to solve problems and make things work better!\n\nHere are some debugging tips: \n\n- Read the instructions out loud. Sometimes you’ll find something you missed when you read aloud.\n- Use the hints in the instructions to help you.\n- Try it out, make adjustments and then try again.\n\nDid you know, computer scientists get bugs all the time. One technique they use to solve their problems is called Rubber Duck Debugging. They talk to a rubber duck (yes, really) or some other inanimate object about what's bothering them about their code. Just talking it out will sometimes lead to figuring out the solution!\n",

        "description": "Reflecting on your hard work means taking some time to think about the things you did, how you did them, and how you can do better next time. It's like taking a break to look back and see what you've accomplished.\n\nReflecting on your hard work is important because it helps you learn and grow. When you reflect on what you've done, you can see what worked well and what didn't, and that helps you figure out how to do things better next time. It's like learning from your mistakes and successes so you can do even better in the future.\n\nWhen you reflect on your hard work, you also feel good about what you've accomplished. It’s great to give yourself a pat on the back and say, \"good job!\" You’ve done so much! \n\nTake a few minutes to complete your Reflection sheet. \n",
