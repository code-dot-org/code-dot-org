Sprite Lab is an open-ended coding environment that uses block-based code. Students will learn the basics of Sprite Lab throughout this lesson to plan and build their interactive map in the following lessons. \n\nIn this integrated lesson, students learn social studies concepts by creating a map with code. To begin, students will examine several examples of maps and discuss what features make up the map. In the wrap-up, students will discuss the role of a map maker. \n\n*Note:  The maps and images will not be a perfect fit in all cases. Fortunately, there is a Sprite Upload tool and access to the Animation Library students can use in the freeplay levels that allow for customization.*\n",

To build a base understanding together you might consider reading one of these books about maps: <a href=\"https://oladaniel.com/maps\" target=\"_blank\">Maps by Aleksandra and Daniel Mizielinski</a>, <a href=\"https://bghennessy.com/f/the-once-upon-a-time-map-book\" target=\"_blank\">The Once Upon a Time Map Book by BG Hennessy</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRy3daJLhtg\" target=\"_blank\">City Atlas: Travel the World with 30 City Maps by Georgia Cherry</a>.\n\nAdditionally, it may be beneficial to spend some time **building interactive maps with hands on materials in your classroom**: fill a bucket with colored strips of felt to represent roads, rivers, houses and more. Let students build and play in an imaginary town. Or after a shared experience (i.e. recess or field trip) create a topographical map using play-dough or salt dough.\n\n**Computer Science:** In this module students will be working a lot with sprites including changing the location and size of them and initiating behaviors. <a href=\"https://studio.code.org/s/coursef-2023/lessons/3\" target=\"_blank\">CS Fundamentals Course F Lesson 3</a> is a great introduction to two concepts at the heart of this all: sprites and behaviors.\n\n"

Sometimes maps are solely factual (rivers, mountains, boundaries), while at other times they’re opinions (best amusement parks or tacos) or unique to the mapmaker (Grandma’s house, my elementary school).\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** \"Map 2: The Oregon Trail\" Slide\n\n**Discuss:** \n- What is different about this map? \n- Is there anything missing from this map? \n- Why do you think that is?\n\n**Discussion Goal:** Students will notice that this map's lack of color and the overall feel is different. They might infer that this is a map in a video game based on the style and “Press Spacebar to Continue” sign. There are no boundaries; instead, the map has a Start and Finish point with town names along the route. Explain to students that this depicts a map made during the USA’s “westward expansion” and before there were state boundaries. \n\n_Note: This map is from the popular 1990s video game “The Oregon Trail” in which players travel a 2,000-mile overland route through current-day Idaho and Oregon with their families, wagons, and animals. The game is set between 1840-1860._\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** \"Map 3: Exploring Maps\" Slide\n\n**Discuss:** \n- What do the colors mean in this map? \n- Why are there both color boundaries and state boundaries? \n- What does the mapmaker want to teach us about this part of North America?\n\n**Discussion Goal:** Students will start to recognize that map makers have much to consider when designing a new map. The use of color can help distinguish different boundaries and provide focus. The colors in this map indicate different Native American tribal regions pre-colonization. The mapmaker overlapped current state boundaries to show the change of “borders” over time between two groups of people. Maps change over time as new features are discovered, as geography or boundaries change, and as the purpose of the map changes. \n"

        "description": "Let’s refresh our memories on landmarks. A landmark is a special place or thing that is very important and unique. For example, the Statue of Liberty in New York City is a famous American landmark because it’s a symbol that represents freedom and democracy. It’s as big as a 22-story building, and people worldwide come to see it! The Statue of Liberty reminds us that everyone should have the freedom to be who they are and do what they want. \n\nAnother example of a landmark is the 81-story-tall Eiffel Tower in Paris, France. The Eiffel Tower is important because it’s a symbol of France and its culture. It was built over 130 years ago for a big event called the World's Fair, and it was supposed to be taken down afterward, but people liked it so much that they decided to keep it! \n\nThese are examples of two famous landmarks in the world. However, a landmark can be something as simple as a special tree or a local library. It’s your turn to write down as many ideas as possible of landmarks you might want to add to your map. Now is just a time to brainstorm, so don’t worry about choosing which ones you’ll use until later. ",

        "description": "Debugging is like solving a puzzle. When you play with a puzzle, sometimes a piece doesn't fit quite right, or you might find that you put the wrong piece in the wrong spot. Debugging is like fixing a puzzle by looking at what went wrong and figuring out how to fix it.\n\nTo debug, you need to be patient and try different things until you find a solution. Just like playing with a puzzle, you need to keep trying until everything fits perfectly. Debugging is a way to make sure that everything works the way it should, and it's an important skill for anyone who wants to solve problems and make things work better!\n\nHere are some debugging tips: \n\n- Read the instructions out loud. Sometimes you’ll find something you missed when you read aloud.\n- Use the hints in the instructions to help you.\n- Try it out, make adjustments and then try again.\n\nDid you know, computer scientists get bugs all the time. One technique they use to solve their problems is called Rubber Duck Debugging. They talk to a rubber duck (yes, really) or some other inanimate object about what's bothering them about their code. Just talking it out will sometimes lead to figuring out the solution!\n",
