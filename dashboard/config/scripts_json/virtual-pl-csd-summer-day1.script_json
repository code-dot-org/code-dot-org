You may want to follow up this question by asking students how they think a web browser for the blind might deal with paragraphs. For example, while sighted people may use spacing and new lines to separate out paragraphs, what should a screen reader do?\n\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Key Vocabulary:**\n\n- HTML - Hypertext Markup Language, a language used to create web pages\n- HTML Element - A piece of a website, marked by a start tag and often closed with an end tag\n- HTML Tag - The special set of characters that indicates the start and end of an HTML element and that element's type\n",

So, for example, the structure could include different headings and paragraphs but would say nothing about the color of text or how big it is displayed. The style of the page is the specifics of its appearance. Without a particular style, each web browser would decide how to display different web page elements on its own.\n\nStyles are important to allow web developers to decide exactly how a web page looks on the screen. Because styles are separate from structure and content, web developers can change the style of an entire page very easily, without having to make any changes to the structure and content of the web page. This means that it's very easy for web pages to have an individual look and feel that is unified across the entire page.\n\n**Circulate:** Support students as they continue through the first set of skill building levels."
