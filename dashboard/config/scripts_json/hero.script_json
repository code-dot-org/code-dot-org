Check your technology and decide if you need to troubleshoot anything in advance of your Hour of Code.\n\n### One Day Before Your Hour of Code\n\n- Print one or more of the [Exit Ticket examples](https://docs.google.com/a/code.org/document/d/1ylIlO7Pppk6W3Jt58VHS5mjvnshg9URvj3iCU0Ok6qY/edit?usp=sharing) at the end of this lesson plan, or create your own. \n- Each student who completes the activity should receive a [certificate](https://studio.code.org/certificates/batch?course=bWM=).

You can play as Alex or Steve as you work through mazes. You'll need to pick up items, and explore in a world made up of cubes of things.\n\n\n*Say: “Today we’re going to spend one hour learning to code. Has anyone here heard the term “code” before? What does it mean?”*\n\nStudents might mention that a “code” is like a secret message, or that it’s related to computers in some way."
