Students will demystify generative AI models by exploring their internal structures through the familiar lens of input, storage, process, and output. They will gain insights into how these models represent language, the impact of training data on model performance, and the potential for bias. Using this knowledge they will be presented with scenarios throughout the unit where they can help educate individuals who feel powerless or lack agency in how AI is impacting their lives, or respond to individuals who have only read the hype headlines and offer feedback or criticism based on their knowledge of how these AI systems work."

Students start by predicting and discussing how retrieval can impact a chatbot’s behavior, and then investigate and modify existing chatbots to confirm or expand their initial guesses. Through guided activities, they will learn how adding specific information to a chatbot’s knowledge base can significantly improve the accuracy and relevance of its responses. Students will practice adding retrieval information to elicit specific responses from the AI and engage in activities that incorporate personal experiences to see the effect of their retrieval on how the chatbot functions.",

Be prepared to address the following situations in this discussion:\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t<br />3) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherimoya\">cherimoya</a> is a fruit common to South America, but may not be a common fruit your students have heard of. It’s possible many students may say “this isn’t a word”, but one or two students may speak up because they’re familiar with this fruit. Be sure to elevate those voices and highlight how our own knowledge is sometimes limited by lack of exposure to different words or phrases. Or, if no one raises this point, be sure to point this out to students explicitly such as showing them the Wikipedia page. In either case, make sure cherimoya is classified as a “word” before leaving the discussion\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t<br />8) ullaakkut and 10) yá'át'ééh are both words in other languages - <a href=\"https://www.adventurecanada.com/canadian-high-arctic-and-greenland/ullaakkut-a-guide-to-inuktitut-for-beginners\">ullaakkut means hello in Inuktitut</a>, a language spoken by Inuit peoples in Canada and Greenland; and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h0tbtlZx0A\">yá'át'ééh means “hello” in the Navajo / Diné language</a>. Similar to above, students may initially classify these as not words because they are unfamiliar with them, but it is important to surface the meaning and use of these words to students either with a quick google search or elevating the voice of a student in class who is already familiar with these words. As a result, make sure these terms don’t end up in the “Not Words” category by the end of the discussion.\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t<br />4) wierd is a misspelling of either the word “weird” or the word “wired”. Students may initially say that this is “not a word”, but another student or yourself should challenge them by pointing out that if this is typed into a device with autocorrect, it will automatically correct it to one of these other words. Even in this slide deck, the word has a red squiggly underline representing that the computer recognizes it as something, even if it’s not a correctly spelled word. This may inspire the class to create a new category to represent this term - it’s not a correctly spelled word, but it’s also not a made-up word, so maybe there’s a new category for “misspelled words” or “important terms that aren’t words”. Let students guide how they want to handle this situation, even if they decide not to make a new category and it remains in “not word”.\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t<br />At some point, students who are more familiar with the Scrabble game may try to invoke the “rules of Scrabble” which restrict words in other languages, proper nouns, or abbreviations. From this perspective, words (8) and (10) above would be restricted, as would 5) Reykjavik (the capital of Iceland) and 9) ATM (since it is an abbreviation for Automatic Teller Machine). If this comes up, use this as an opportunity to question the effect that arbitrary rules have on what we consider valid language, since these are all definitely words that are used in society even if not officially allowed in Scrabble. You could consider creating new categories to represent these phrases, such as “Still words but not allowed in Scrabble” or “Part of language, but not allowed in Scrabble”. Or, the class could decide these belong in the Words category, regardless of what Scrabble thinks, and that’s the end of the story.\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t<br /><i class=\"fa fa-lightbulb-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> <strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> Ultimately, this is an exercise to surface that the way we identify words versus nonsense - much like Calvin and Hobbes in the comic panel - can be contextual to our lived experiences and influences what we consider important information versus random noise that can be ignored. It’s okay if the discussion ends without closure, so long as students have wrestled with how what they initially considered “words” may have been expanded as they were exposed to new contexts in the discussion. However, be very intentional that the discussion ends with very few items in the “Not Words” category, especially making sure ullaakkut and yá'át'ééh are not in this category and are instead classified as either a Word or a new category the class has created."

At this stage, all we’re doing is building a “word bank” that a model can recognize and eventually reproduce. But the model doesn’t have any inherent understanding of the meaning of these words - this happens in later steps and later lessons. If we asked a model to respond to a prompt just with the training done today, it could generate any of the words students are putting on their posters, but the results would be random and nonsensical since it doesn’t have any tools to help it make decisions about which words are best used in which situations.

Or, in the example of the keywords, a language model may learn that this task only involves these keywords, which may lead to overemphasizing certain characteristics or thinking there’s only one way to perform a specific task.\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td style=\"width: 25%\"><img src=\"https://images.code.org/117075a2ce1bb476cb22266c21b9c6a6-image-1712461998805.png\"></td>\n    <td style=\"width: 75%\">\n      <i class=\"fa fa-microphone\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> <strong>Say:</strong> This activity was specifically designed so bias would appear when looking at the data together, so the fact that these biases appeared is not a complete surprise.

When the page loads, it provides a visualization of several words mapped onto a 3D space. They have a <a href=\"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/WordEmbeddingDemo/tutorial.html\">tutorial available</a> that explains more about how this works. This can be an option to show students if they are interested, but graphing words on 2D or 3D spaces is not something students are expected to do in this course so we have avoided it in the lesson itself."

Digging into this may reveal that regurgitating responses from the text doesn’t always mean we know what we’re talking about.

One engineer, Claire, says “If someone with an allergy eats a peanut, it could be life-threatening - we should not design any meals with them anymore”. Another engineer, Kim, says “They don’t have to eat the peanuts and can just pick them out. I don’t think we should change everything just for something they can avoid”. What should we do - remove peanuts completely? Or leave them in and accept some of the risk involved?\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t<br /><i class=\"fa fa-lightbulb-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> <strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> This is an open-ended discussion hitting on some of the ethical considerations with machine learning. This particular discussion focuses on safety concerns and what an acceptable level of risk is when making decisions with machines like this. Some students may think the consequences - a life-threatening reaction - may necessitate removing this risk from the system altogether. Others may think that, since this is something where personal judgement can be applied by just a subset of users, it may be fine to let this network keep designing meals with peanuts. Focus the conversation on wrestling with both sides of the debate, elevating student voices to think critically and carefully about the scenario. It’s likely - and acceptable - for the discussion to end in a place of non-closure - instead, aim for students having come to their own decision that they can justify from the scenario and their lived experiences.\n\t\t<br />\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n\n</table>    \n    ",

Some kitchens avoid nuts altogether so consumers can be sure they won’t have an allergic reaction. Others apply warnings saying “These items were baked in a facility that includes nuts” as a warning for people to use their own judgement and discretion.\n\nFrom a machine-learning perspective, this scenario is relatable to stories where an AI model or chatbot was released and then needed to be adjusted after the release to account for a bias or harm they had not considered or intended. Consider pausing the lesson here and have students reflect on their own experiences or knowledge with AI or other technologies where they witnessed unintended impacts. One example could be the [Twitter Cropping Algorithm](https://blog.x.com/engineering/en_us/topics/insights/2021/sharing-learnings-about-our-image-cropping-algorithm), which was discovered to make biased decisions on what it decided to crop out of photos. This blog post is a great example of an organization taking action once the unintended harm was discovered, although it is likely too technical for students to read and process on their own."

        "description": "**For the Teacher:** In this game, you know the secret rules (explained below) and are reacting to the suggestions that the class makes. As the class suggests words, you tell them whether or not words are accepted or rejected. This game requires students to notice patterns in the words that are accepted or rejected, and use those patterns to inform the guesses they make. The goal of the activity is for students to eventually discern the rules of the game from these patterns.\n\n**The Rules:** The secret of the game is: words with double letters are accepted and all others are rejected. This is why Teeth is accepted (because of the double e’s) while Mouth is not (because no letter is repeated). This is also where the name of the game comes from - Green Glass Door all have double letters.\n\n**Playing the Game:** Ask students to suggest words and write them down somewhere visible, then tell the class whether the Green Glass Door accepts or rejects each word. Instead of doing this one-at-a-time, it can be helpful to take words in batches - like 3 to 5 at a time - and then mark each one as accept or reject in a batch. It’s important to leave all guesses in a visible spot so students can look at the data to inform their next guesses. Over time, students may start to notice the pattern - that words with double-letters are accepted - and start guessing those more frequently. If students are struggling to catch on, it can be helpful to rewrite the list so several accepted words are together and several rejected words are together. You can also provide your own examples, or reference the name of game - Green Glass Door - as a hint.\n\n**Managing Expectations:** This activity has a specific type of engagement that some students may struggle with: the activity deliberately starts with 0 knowledge, so most answers are likely to be incorrect rather than correct. Some students may struggle with randomly guessing and getting it incorrect more often in the beginning. However, this is exactly the mindset that is necessary to carry forward into the rest of the lesson and is an important part of how machine learning really works: machines make an enormous amount of incorrect guesses that are gradually refined over time before eventually getting more and more accurate.\n\n**Ending the Game:** As the game continues, some students will discovered the rule while others may not. Encourage the students who think they know to keep it a secret until others have caught on. Using your judgement, when enough students feel like they know the rule, continue to the next slide to reveal the rule of the game",

It also helps to move quickly through this round, since any correct answers will likely be due to luck rather than strategy.\n\n**Laughing in a Conversation:** Some students may be very skeptical that it’s possible to try and have a conversation when you don’t understand any of the words. As a potential talking point, consider asking students if they’ve ever had trouble hearing someone and instead of asking them to clarify, they just laugh or smile or nod. Conversation strategies like this make it possible to continue conversations without having full context. In some ways, we are doing something similar in this first conversation of this activity."

This means their embeddings are likely close to each other, which means they might be synonyms or antonyms or modifiers for each other."

However, make sure to emphasize the following words as contributing to this word’s meaning:\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t<br />“Animal” - because bats could be animals or they could be a motion used by animals, this word provides a strong signal\n\t\t<br />“To” and “Away” - these together give clues that the word may be a verb rather than a noun\n\t\t<br />“Paws” - because “batting” is something that happens with animal paws\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t<br /><img src=\"https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png\" /> Click the animation\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t<br /><i class=\"fa fa-microphone\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> <strong>Say:</strong> Here’s one way a language model could have used other words in the sentence to help understand which meaning of “bat” should be used. Notice that some words help in different ways - for example, “to” and “away” give clues to the grammar of the sentence and indicate “bat” is likely a verb, but “animal” and “paws” give clues to the meaning of the word itself.

Ideally, the structure of this lesson steers away from these conversations by leaving that choice up to mathematics and probability - we aren’t making any kind of “value judgement” on the words, but instead comparing them to the data and seeing how frequently those words appeared in the data we collected. Hopefully this helps ground this decision away from ideas of “favorite” or “best”, and more towards “most probable from the data”. However, the underlying point - that there is some kind of preference or favoritism happening - is still fair, but the real place to have that conversation is when collecting the initial data used in the app. If students want the app to make different choices, they should collect more data and see how it influences the app."

Specifically, the presenters discuss how probability is the primary way language models choose which words to use next when generating output. The truth is more complicated, as discussed throughout this unit, but if looking at just the output layer: this video can be a good supplement to this lesson. The only reason it’s not included is for timing - the video is long at 7 minutes in length.

Make sure students know where the instructions panel is, can send messages, know how to clear the chat, and know how to copy the chat. Building this fluency early will make later lessons easier.\n\n**Teaching Tip: Not Every Flagged Message is Inappropriate** - When a student's on-task message is flagged, it doesn't necessarily indicate inappropriate behavior; it may simply be due to a specific word triggering our filters. We encourage trying alternative words or questions. Context is crucial, as legitimate discussions can sometimes be flagged. For instance, messages mentioning \"Hitler\" are automatically flagged, which has helped us monitor student programs in the past but in this unit it affects almost any discussion on World War II, even legitimate ones. Therefore, a flagged message should be carefully reviewed to discern if it's genuinely inappropriate or just caught by our system's parameters."

If the resource doesn't appear for you, you may need to become a verified teacher - [learn more about this process here](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/115001550131-How-to-Become-a-Verified-Teacher).\n\n**Teaching with Student Responses:** Certain level types are designed to be leveraged with our [Student Summary feature](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/14544890300301-Can-I-see-a-summary-of-all-my-students-responses-for-question-based-levels), specifically: _Predict & Discuss_ and _Mid-Lesson Check-In_ levels.

After students lock in their predictions, the teacher leads a discussion asking for students to share their observations and hypotheses. There are no right-or-wrong answers - they’re just predictions. The teacher should avoid validating any predictions - instead, as the lesson progresses, students will get the chance to investigate their hypotheses and see how well their predictions matched with reality. This means the most important part of these discussions are students feeling comfortable sharing their intuitions and forming opinion, and less about “right or wrong” answers. For more information about these levels, please read the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wESWwYm7Ty46eEK9qFcYfYI7NfG9mqodD12YOmuUcrs/edit\" target=\"_blank\">Teaching Guide to Incorporating Student Responses in Lessons</a>."

You can assure students that there is no trick, just a set of strategies that tend to work more often than others but are still unreliable. This is where the warm-up can be useful - strategies for talking to one person may not work with someone else, and it takes time to figure out the right way to “unlock” certain conversations. The same is true for system prompts, where the best way to get what you’re looking for is to just keep trying different phrases until it seems to work."

After students lock in their predictions, the teacher leads a discussion asking for students to share their observations and hypotheses. There are no right-or-wrong answers - they’re just predictions. The teacher should avoid validating any predictions - instead, as the lesson progresses, students will get the chance to investigate their hypotheses and see how well their predictions matched with reality. This means the most important part of these discussions are students feeling comfortable sharing their intuitions and forming opinion, and less about “right or wrong” answers.

This can help us understand how the sentence “The food in Tucson is awesome - some great restaurants in Tucson are Poco and Moms, Kingfisher, and Franks.” impacts our model.\n- In the initial training data, a word like “Franks” was probably “close” to an entirely different set of words. For example: it could be “close” to “hot dog” or “person” or “blunt” because of the phrase “Let me be frank with you…”\n- This sentence creates a new association between “Franks” and the phrase “great restaurant”, along with other great restaurants like Kingfisher and Poco and Moms.\n- This helps update the embedding for “Franks” so it is now “closer” to other great restaurants, and more likely to be listed in a chatbot response."

Otherwise, it may be better to spend class working with students who need additional support based on yesterday’s lesson and the check-in level. Verified teachers can review exemplars and strategies for each level as a resource in the lesson plan.\n\n**Teaching Tip: Less Writing, More Copying**\nThis lesson implicitly encourages students to spend their time searching for sources and copying directly from them, rather than trying to write retrieval information themselves (which is mostly what they did yesterday). This correlates to how retrieval works in a more realistic sense with actual language models: instead of looking at individual words or statements, modern large-language models ingest entire documents or manuals or websites in order to augment their knowledgebase.

This is very loosely inspired by real-world events where school districts relied on chatbots like ChatGPT to make decisions about books to comply with state laws. In an effort to comply with these new laws, several school districts hastily resorted to using AI to make recommendations on certain books to remove from circulation. This is an example of how an intended user - libraries and schools - were using chatbots for a surprising and unintended use case with a wide variety of affected uses (also both intended and unintended).

Students who may have been confident and engaged in earlier lessons may find themselves deflated by the task of writing about their chatbots and describing their decisions. It can be helpful to acknowledge this change in dynamic, but encourage students to lean into it rather than away from it. Taking time to document and describe our chatbots and other digital artifacts is a core part of any new technology, and might take a different set of skills but is just as important. Be sure to provide writing supports to students who may need it, such as having students explain it to you first before writing it down."

However, just because the training data is biased doesn’t mean the end result needs to be, and it can be helpful to push students past the intended design of the chatbot and instead consider the impact on whoever is using it. It can also be difficult to imagine what a “quick fix” for this issue would be, and it may be useful to mention how this is an area of active research in the AI community to help address when bias is discovered in AI models.\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n\n</table>    \n    "

In the original lesson, there are 9 different scenarios that students can choose from to participate in, but in this lesson there is only one scenario (the medical one).\n\nThe original lesson is also designed to be an hour long. For this lesson, the warm-up has been removed to shorten the lesson.\n\nIf you would like to extend and enrich this lesson, consider exploring the other scenarios in the original lesson."

Here's the big picture behind this activity:\n- Students are [participating in a **collaborative game**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rqtfMZyn-UekUoVFgYCHyVqOa7StNY9-wl-FlLOaZqk/edit#heading=h.59k2gm16lgj2), where each person takes on a specific role or persona and they all have to work together to \"win\" against the scenario set out by the game. This is similar in spirit to board games like [Pandemic](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30549/pandemic) or [Forbidden Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbidden_Island_(game))\n- Students will be in groups of 4, where all four people have taken on a persona [related to a specific scenario](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9P0FYWMBDQguWedAGi541P-HYbRS1gbcjFbFxdpRSk/edit). Their goal will be to work together to come up with guidelines for Generative AI that try to satisfy the needs and goals of everyone in the group. \n  - For example: an actor, a producer, an audience member, and a costume designer must work together to come up with guidelines for use of Generative AI in movie productions.\n- Each student has a particular persona they can embody on a [Character Card](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e0C1Tp1JhpnJNFjzlxI-bJpisZmZZe6uyglW0JgNm7s/edit). These cards include some baseline information about how this person might feel about generative AI, along with some news articles that students read and react to _as this character_.\n\n\nEven though the ultimate goal is to be in a group as a character solving a problem, the lesson plan introduces these steps in stages rather than explaining the full game all-at-once. First students are introduced to their character and read their news articles. Once they understand their character, then they form their groups and are given their scenario. And once they understand their scenario, they can begin the collaborative game of coming up with guidelines for generative AI."
