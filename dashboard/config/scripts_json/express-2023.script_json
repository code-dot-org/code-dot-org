While working through this puzzle with the class, remind students that making mistakes is okay and remind them that the only way to be successful is to be persistent. Discuss what to do when a program doesn't work (debug it!) or how to get through the frustration that can come with working on a computer.\n\nNext, you'll need to describe how the blocks in the workspace move the bird toward the pig.  Show students how to drag blocks from the toolbox and connect them beneath the `when run` block, but don't solve the puzzle.\n\n**Discuss:** Think about how we would get the bird to the pig using arrows.  How do we use these blocks instead?\n\nHave students use their fingers to point the direction that the bird should go next.  Once you feel like you have a classroom consensus, try to get students to put into words which block will make that action happen.  Roll your mouse over different options and have them shout \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nDrag blocks into place one at a time, then click \"Run\" after each one.  This will not only let them see how far the bird has gone, but set good habits for when they start working to solve their own puzzles.\n\nContinue this pattern, fixing bugs as they arise, until the bird successfully gets to the pig.\n\n#### Additional Demonstration\n\nWe've included some multiple choice prediction levels. These could be used after finishing the Warm Up.\n\nPrediction Levels:\n\n - [Programming in Maze #1](https://studio.code.org/levels/8730)\n - [Programming in Maze #2](https://studio.code.org/levels/8729)\n\n**Transition:** Now that students have seen an online puzzle in practice, they should be ready to start solving puzzles of their own.  Continue to the lab or bring out their classroom computers.",

        "description": "**Circulate:** Teachers play a vital role in computer science education and supporting a collaborative and vibrant classroom environment. During online activities, the role of the teacher is primarily one of encouragement and support. Online lessons are meant to be student-centered, so teachers should avoid stepping in when students get stuck. Some ideas on how to do this are: \n\n - Utilize Pair Programming whenever possible during the activity.\n - Encourage students with questions/challenges to start by asking their partner.\n - Unanswered questions can be escalated to a nearby group, who might already know the solution.\n - Have students describe the problem that they’re seeing. What is it supposed to do? What does it do? What does that tell you?\n - Remind frustrated students that frustration is a step on the path to learning, and that persistence will pay off.\n - If a student is still stuck after all of this, ask leading questions to get the student to spot an error on their own.\n\n**Discuss:** After providing students with end-of-class warnings, grab everyone's attention and get them to reflect on the experiences that they just had.\n\n - Did anyone feel frustrated during any of the puzzles?\n - Did anyone notice the need to be persistent?\n\n**Transition:** Have students grab their ***Thinkspot Journals** and take a moment to reflect on the experience for themselves."

If you make sure that everything is working line by line, then when you get to the place that your code isn't doing what it's supposed to, you know that you've found a bug.

To solve this puzzle, place a set size block anywhere in your program and use it to change the size of some of your dancers. \n* Dancers created as a group have a default size of 30. Other dancers have a default size of 100.\n\n#### Properties Level 12\n\n* As with the previous level, make sure to only use the set tint to (color) block after you have made the dancers in your program. For example, placing it as the first step in the setup area of your program will have no effect.\n\n#### Properties Level 13\n\n* With the right code, you should see the dancer cycle through different colors, sizes, or dance moves.\n* Make sure there is a teal change, a teal randomize block, or a purple do forever block connected inside the every 2 measures block. \n* Make sure do forever blocks are set to either (Next), (Previous), or (Random). Otherwise, the dancer will just perform the set move repeatedly.\n* Note that the code students write in this level is not checked for correctness. This means they will always pass the level, even if they do not change the program. Students should feel free to experiment with their code in ways that are interesting to them. Click the “Finish” button to move on.\n* Making new dancers inside the every 2 measures block will cause your program to create multiple identical dancers at the same location(s) and may lead to unintended consequences!\n",

If you were to say *\"while there is a hole, fill it with dirt\"* what would they do? How long would they do that?\n\nWhen you use a word like “while”, you are relying on a condition to tell the computer how long the loop should run. A condition is a statement that is tested and found to be true or false. In the case above, the condition is if there is a hole. It’s only possible for there to be a hole or for there not to be a hole, thus the statement is only ever true or false.\n\nTell the students they will be learning about a new kind of loop. Previously, students only used loops to repeat a command a certain number of times. Here, they won't always know how many times to repeat the command, however, they will know when to stop or when to keep going. While loops allow the programmer to repeat a command as long as a condition is still true. In the previous example, the condition is the existence of a hole.\n\nIf there's time, have the students discuss other times using a while loop would be useful. Examples include:\n\n - Running toward a ball while it is in front of you.\n - Filling a glass while it has space for more liquid.\n - Walk forward while there is a path ahead.\n\n###Preview of Online Puzzles\n\nPull up a puzzle from today's online Code Studio puzzles.

Ask the class what the farmer should do within the while loop. \n    - The farmer should remove 1. The farmer will keep \"removing 1 dirt\" while there is dirt. In other words, when there is no dirt, remove 1 will no longer execute!\n\nFill in the rest of the code and press Run. Discuss with the class why this worked.\n",

As they do so, have them touch on what the planning-to-coding experience was like for them, including ideas they'd still like to implement. \r\n* **Pair Playtesting**: Have students or groups pair up and playtest each other's projects. As they do, ask them to provide positive and constructive feedback to each other. The benefit here is that students will have the opportunity to provide and respond to feedback in a smaller setting. \r\n* **Gallery Walk**: Ensure all students have their projects ready for testing. Have students move \"musical chairs\"-style to another computer and playtest the project there for a few minutes, until they receive a signal from you to move to another computer. Repeat this every few minutes. While there is less opportunity for structured communication here, this ensures students get to demo as many of their peers' projects as possible.",
