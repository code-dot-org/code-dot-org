Students will begin to form an understanding of the programming model of this tool, and explore ways they can use it to express themselves. \n\nIn this skill-building lesson, students will work through a series of programming levels on the computer, finishing with an open-ended “free play” task where they can build whatever they like. Students will write programs and learn about the two concepts at the heart of Sprite Lab: sprites and behaviors. Students will learn to create and animate sprites and make them interactive using events."

They will begin to assign roles to different elements within their games learning to differentiate between sprites that act as players (controlled by the user) and sprites that form the environment (static elements or obstacles). They will understand the roles these sprites play in shaping gameplay dynamics.  \n\nThroughout the lesson, students will apply their knowledge by designing and implementing game mechanics using Sprite Lab.

Working against the clock, they'll brainstorm, plan, and code their games, embracing the creative constraints of the theme to produce innovative and engaging gameplay experiences. Students will include variables in their games to track and modify values dynamically. \n\nBy the end of the lesson, they will have gained experience in game design, coding, and problem-solving, ready to share their creations with others in a user testing experience in the next lesson."

The purpose of this warm up is to model quick decision making by keeping the ideas simple. Show how students can make up parts of the game – without including too many details – and then move on to the next idea. \n\nOpen both spinners in their own tabs: [Game Mechanic Spinner Link](https://wheelofnames.com/wkm-e9j), [Game Character Spinner Link](https://wheelofnames.com/e6p-gd3)\n- Spin to randomly select a game mechanic.\n- Spin to choose the main character. \n- With your randomly selected game mechanic and character, use the sentence stems on the slide to brainstorm a silly game.\n\n**The goal is to keep it simple, silly and quick-paced. Here are some examples you might come up with:**\n- You spun ‘avoid’ & ‘grumpy cat’. In this game the grumpy cat tries to avoid the floating hearts. The variable would be named grumpyLevel and it would decrease when the cat touches the heart.\n- You spun ‘click’ and ‘sassy fox.’ In this game the player tries to click on the sassy fox but she keeps disappearing and changing her location so it’s challenging to catch her. The variable would be named score and it would increase each time the player clicks on the sassy fox before she disappears. \n- You spun ‘move’ and ‘chill sloth.’ In this game the chill sloth is moving extremely slow and the player tries to move him to his food before the fast ants eat it all. The variable would be named food. It would increase when the sloth touches the food and decrease when the ants touch the food. \n\n"

We have gone from learning the basics of adding sprites to being able to keep track of changing values stored in a variable. Then we used that knowledge to create winning or losing conditions in a game by using a conditional statement to check when our variable reaches a certain value. We worked in teams during a fun Game Jam just like game developers do in the real world.  Then we conducted user tests to collect data and make decisions on how to improve our games. You can keep creating games of your own in Sprite Lab anytime! ",
