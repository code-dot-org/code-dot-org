For students who struggle with what to do in an open-ended project, seeing student work, especially early in the year, can help spark ideas for future activities.\n\n* Peer review, either in small groups or pairs.\n\n  * One benefit to this is that teachers have the reviews of other students when evaluating a student project.\n\n  * Students can see at least one, and potentially several, other student projects.\n\n  * Time must be spent teaching students how to give feedback and what feedback is expected.\n\n* Gallery walk.\n\n  * Half of the class present their work to the other half in very short (30–60 second) interactions and then the halves switch, and the presenters become the audience\n  \n  * This exposes students to more projects but does not provide as much time for thorough evaluation or discussion.\n\n* Presentations to the class\n\n  * Students will be exposed to all other student projects.\n\n  * This can be a time-consuming process, even if students help evaluate another student's work. \n\n",

For students who struggle with what to do in an open-ended project, seeing student work, especially early in the year, can help spark ideas for future activities.\n\n* Peer review, either in small groups or pairs.\n\n  *  One benefit to this is that teachers have the reviews of other students when evaluating a student project.\n\n  *  Students can see at least one, and potentially several, other student projects.\n\n  *  Time must be spent teaching students how to give feedback and what feedback is expected.\n\n* Gallery walk.\n\n  *  Half of the class present their work to the other half in very short (30–60 second) interactions and then the halves switch, and the presenters become the audience\n\n  *  This exposes students to more projects but does not provide as much time for thorough evaluation or discussion.\n\n* Presentations to the class\n\n  *  Students will be exposed to all other student projects.\n\n  *  This can be a time-consuming process, even if students help evaluate another student's work."
