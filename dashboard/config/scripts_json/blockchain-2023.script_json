This system can also be used to verify messages by creating a unique signature that can be verified by anybody. Students then learn that this process is the basis for transactions on blockchain networks, where individuals exchange currency without needing to trust one another. Students use a widget to simulate several blockchain transactions, including mining blocks and adding them to the shared blockchain ledger.\n",

Students are in charge of a fictional investment firm where they can invest $1500 in several fictional assets - NFTs, cryptocurrencies, and stablecoins. Students watch a video that gives an overview of these assets and how value is determined on the blockchain, then they must decide which assets to invest in. Once decided, the teacher generates several fake news stories that impact the value of each asset. By the end of the simulation, students can see how their investments increased or decreased based on the news that was generated. Lastly, students reflect on the simulation and consider other reasons to invest in blockchain assets beyond their purely financial value\n\n**Big Question**: What does it mean for a digital asset to have value in a digital marketplace?",

The thing that makes a hash special is that it is unique to the original message. |\n|![](https://images.code.org/7d0af7cb0f2be25bfd48ef4fa3a3588d-blockchain-2-3-sm.png) | **Say:** Then Kim takes her **private** key and uses that to encrypt the message hash, creating another string of letters and numbers. This is the **signature**, which was created with the private key that only Kim has. |\n|![](https://images.code.org/4aa8e0883b12761ed272401f644e250e-blockchain-2-4-sm.png) | **Say:** Now Kim is ready to send her message, which is now two parts: the original message and the signature.

Here are three steps he needs to take to verify if she sent the message. |\n|![](https://images.code.org/0608cbd2b42659d2f8ee8f3801cef8d0-blockchain-2-6-sm.png) | **Say:** Step 1 - he takes Kim’s **public** key and uses it to decrypt the **signature**. This reverses the encryption created by Kim’s **private** key. |\n|![](https://images.code.org/893ef103de7757631cfe896750f19304-blockchain-2-7-sm.png) | **Say:** Step 2 - Isaac takes the message he received and determines its hash using the same process Kim did.  |\n|![](https://images.code.org/85f54a0d32dcae1a35e30403a9a73b31-blockchain-2-8-sm.png) | **Say:** Step 3 - Finally, Isaac compares the results from his two calculations to see if they match. In this case, they do! |\n|![](https://images.code.org/91a443c4f61acb7b634e79b71c192a0d-blockchain-2-9-sm.png) | **Say:** Since Isaac used Kim’s public key to verify the signature, that means she was the only person who could’ve sent the message.|\n"

The actual number of zeroes varies depending on the number of miners on the network and is optimized so it takes around ~10 minutes for a group of miners to find a proof of work.
