At the end of the lesson, students watch the Why Blockchain? video which summarizes the different types of economic markets and presents Blockchain technology as a new way to exchange goods and services.\n\n**Big Question:** What are the tradeoffs when exchanging goods and services with other people?"

This system can also be used to verify messages by creating a unique signature that can be verified by anybody. Students then learn that this process is the basis for transactions on blockchain networks, where individuals exchange currency without needing to trust one another. Students use a widget to simulate several blockchain transactions, including mining blocks and adding them to the shared blockchain ledger.\n",

Students watch a video that gives an overview of these assets and how value is determined on the blockchain, then they must decide which assets to invest in. Once decided, the teacher generates several fake news stories that impact the value of each asset. By the end of the simulation, students can see how their investments increased or decreased based on the news that was generated.

To help with this, societies created **centralized markets** which use a central, trusted entity to manage transactions. For example: a bank is a central entity that people trust with their money.

Ebay can be thought of as a counter-example to Craig's List from earlier.\n- App stores on your devices - especially the Apple App Store - vet, verify and regulate all apps on the marketplace so you can’t just install whatever app you want, but you’re ensured that the apps are secure.\n- Many major tech companies provide centralized email services, such as Google or Yahoo or Apple. This is a counter-example to the Discord scenario from earlier - unlike discord, all messages are processed and relayed by a central server owned by one of these companies.\n"

            "markdown": "**Make it a Competition...** These scenarios are an opportunity to create a dynamic classroom environment where students are \"racing\" to be the first to mine a blockchain block. You could consider having students compete within their groups, or you could encourage groups to work together to validate signatures and then try different nonce's for the block they create. The video mentions how the winning miner gets a little extra bitcoin - you could consider offering candy or high-fives to the first 4-5 groups who can mine a block.\n\n**...But don't go too far:** Not all students will respond positively to a competitive classroom and may be discouraged from participating if the environment becomes too antagonistic. Even though competition is an intentional part of the Blockchain algorithm, be cautious in how much you lean into this during these scenarios.\n\n**Forged Messages:** Each of these scenarios has at least one message that is forged, but students still have the option of adding it to their \"block\" to send to the network. This is also how the actual blockchain network works - however, it relies on the other miners on the network to verify the transactions themselves. If a student solves a block, make sure to ask them to share the messages that make up their block - if there are any forgeries in there, then the network (aka: the class) can reject the block!"
