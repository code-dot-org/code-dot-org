What is it supposed to do? What does it do? What does that tell you?\n - Remind frustrated students that frustration is a step on the path to learning, and that persistence will pay off\n - If a student is still stuck after all of this, ask leading questions to get the student to spot an error on their own"

In addition to the ideas listed in the last lesson, some more ideas on how to do this are: \r\n\r\n - Remind students to use the debugging process before you approach.\r\n - Have students describe the problem that they’re seeing. What is it supposed to do? What does it do? What does that tell you?\r\n - Remind frustrated students that frustration is a step on the path to learning, and that persistence will pay off.\r\n - If a student is still stuck after all of this, ask leading questions to get the student to spot an error on their own.\r\n\r\n**Transition:** Have students grab their Thinkspot Journals and take a moment to leave lessons for themselves."

During online activities, the role of the teacher is primarily one of encouragement and support. Online lessons are meant to be student-centered, so teachers should avoid stepping in when students get stuck. Some ideas on how to do this are: \n\n - Utilize ***Pair Programming** video whenever possible.\n - Encourage students with questions/challenges to start by asking their partner.\n - Unanswered questions can be escalated to a nearby group, who might already know the solution.\n - Remind students to use the debugging process before you approach.\n - Have students describe the problem that they’re seeing. What is it supposed to do? What does it do? What does that tell you?\n - Remind frustrated students that frustration is a step on the path to learning, and that persistence will pay off.\n - If a student is still stuck after all of this, ask leading questions to get the student to spot an error on their own."
