Getting acquainted with talking and writing about data. In particular we want to:\r\n\t* Draw a distinction between describing what the data shows and describing why it might be that way\r\n\t* In other words: describe connections and trends in data separate from drawing conclusions.\r\n\t* We want students to get in the habit of separating the what from the why when it comes to talking and writing about data\r\n3. Introduce the concept of metadata. We want students to understand the value of data about data, that can be used to find, organize, and manage information. It also increases effective use of data by providing extra information. \r\n",

When a topic is quickly growing in popularity, it is often said to be trending, but there are many different trends or patterns we might find in this data, including historical trends. These patterns might help us to identify, understand, and predict how our world is changing.\r\n\r\nWe will be using Google Trends which is a tool that allows you to visualize data about search history across different times and locations. We can use it to look for interesting patterns, trends, or relationships between multiple trends and try to tell the story that pattern is showing.",

        "description": "Using Google Trends to find patterns represents an important concept in understanding how programs are used to gain insight and knowledge from data. When you worked with the tool, there were elements of both interaction and iteration. You interacted with the tool trying out several different options, and repeated the process (iteration) until you came to a possible conclusion. \r\n\r\n[slide] As you were determining the **Why** in your data stories, you may have been tempted to draw concrete connections. However, it's important to remember that correlation (similarities, patterns) does not equal causation (this thing caused that thing). There can be any number of reasons why a pattern or interesting data point may appear in a chart - and our job is to make an informed decision while recognizing that there may be multiple factors at play.  Usually additional research with several data sets is necessary to understand the exact nature of the relationship between data. Did this one thing cause another thing to happen? Do more people search for chocolate because they want to give it as a gift, or could there perhaps be another reason?\r\n\r\n[slide] In this unit we will be making charts to help answer questions:\r\n\r\n* *\"I think this visualization tells me this…\"*\r\n\t* Something is more popular than something else\r\n\t* Something is more important than something else\r\n\t* Something has become more or less searched over time\r\n\r\n* *\"... but I'm not sure because…\"*\r\n\t* I don't know exactly how the data was collected\r\n\t* This might tell me people searched for green more than red, but it doesn't tell me why they do that or that green is a better color\r\n\t* We need more data!\r\n\r\nWhen we consider datasets, it's helpful to know as much about those datasets as possible. Where did the data come from? How much data is included? When was it collected?\r\n\r\nAll of this information is considered **metadata** which is defined as \"data about data\". \r\n\r\nWe can have metadata about any digital data. For example, this picture contains metatdata that tells us the when the picture was created, what the resolution is, and how many people have downloaded it. Datasets can also have metadata that explains more about the information in the dataset. You've seen this in App Lab!",

In particular, students may not receive a grade based on performance on topic questions nor can they be used for teacher evaluation. Beyond these requirements, however, they are primarily intended to formatively assess student progress and learning as they prepare for the end of course exam.\r\n\r\nWithin our own course we recommend that you use them in a variety of ways:\r\n\r\n* Throughout the unit assign topic questions to students related to the topics students are learning about that day or that week\r\n* Prior to the unit assessment assign topic questions to help students practice and prepare for the summative assessment\r\n* After the unit assessment use these topic questions to help students track their progress towards preparation for the AP assessment\r\n\r\n![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/Screenshot-2020-03-06-at-7.39.15-PM.png)\r\n\r\nClick for more info: [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dqYF5u0AULjw049gaCwAP34ZSe0VuEWbAjWoH1-YMW0/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n"
