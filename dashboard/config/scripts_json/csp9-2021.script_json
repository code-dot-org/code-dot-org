        "description": "### Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy\n\n\n* **The Data Analysis Process:** This unit is built around a data analysis process that helps students break down how data is turned into new information about the world. Some lessons are designed around different steps of this process, like cleaning data or building visualizations. Other lessons focus on ways this process is applied in real-world contexts like citizen science or machine learning. The data analysis process helps provide a consistent reference point as students explore the importance of data analysis in computing. \n\n* **Exploring Data with the Data Visualizer:** The Data Visualizer is a tool built into App Lab that allows students to quickly create visualizations of the data they've added to their projects. The set of possible visualizations is intentionally limited to a few ways to change or modify the chart. This tool aims to encourage exploring the different kinds of questions that can be answered with data visualizations, with a greater emphasis on students' ability to create a variety of visualizations quickly.\n\n\n### Major Assessment and Projects\n\nStudents use the data visualizer to find and present a data story. Using what they've learned about the data analysis process, students either choose a dataset inside the data library or upload one of their own and create visualizations that find interesting patterns that may reveal new insights and knowledge. Students complete an activity guide describing their findings and the process they used in identifying them. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n\n### AP Connections\n\nThis unit and unit project helps build towards the enduring understandings listed below. For a detailed mapping of units to Learning Objectives and EKs please see the \"Standards\" page for this unit.\n\n* DAT-2: Programs can be used to process data, which allows users to discover information and create new knowledge.\n* IOC-1: While computing innovations are typically designed to achieve a specific purpose, they may have unintended consequences.\n\n\nThis unit includes content from the following topics from the AP CS Principles Framework. For more detailed information on topic coverage in the course review [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dqYF5u0AULjw049gaCwAP34ZSe0VuEWbAjWoH1-YMW0/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n* 2.3 Extracting Information from Data\n* 2.4 Using Programs with Data\n* 5.3 Computing Bias\n* 5.4 Crowdsourcing"

Introduce the concept of metadata. We want students to understand the value of data about data, that can be used to find, organize, and manage information.

        "description": "Using Google Trends to find patterns represents an important concept in understanding how programs are used to gain insight and knowledge from data. When you worked with the tool, there were elements of both interaction and iteration. You interacted with the tool trying out several different options, and repeated the process (iteration) until you came to a possible conclusion. \r\n\r\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> As you were determining the **Why** in your data stories, you may have been tempted to draw concrete connections. However, it's important to remember that correlation (similarities, patterns) does not equal causation (this thing caused that thing). There can be any number of reasons why a pattern or interesting data point may appear in a chart - and our job is to make an informed decision while recognizing that there may be multiple factors at play.  Usually additional research with several data sets is necessary to understand the exact nature of the relationship between data. Did this one thing cause another thing to happen? Do more people search for chocolate because they want to give it as a gift, or could there perhaps be another reason?\r\n\r\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> In this unit we will be making charts to help answer questions:\r\n\r\n* *\"I think this visualization tells me this…\"*\r\n\t* Something is more popular than something else\r\n\t* Something is more important than something else\r\n\t* Something has become more or less searched over time\r\n\r\n* *\"... but I'm not sure because…\"*\r\n\t* I don't know exactly how the data was collected\r\n\t* This might tell me people searched for green more than red, but it doesn't tell me why they do that or that green is a better color\r\n\t* We need more data!\r\n\r\nWhen we consider datasets, it's helpful to know as much about those datasets as possible. Where did the data come from? How much data is included? When was it collected?\r\n\r\nAll of this information is considered **metadata** which is defined as \"data about data\". \r\n\r\nWe can have metadata about any digital data. For example, this picture contains metatdata that tells us the when the picture was created, what the resolution is, and how many people have downloaded it. Datasets can also have metadata that explains more about the information in the dataset. You've seen this in App Lab!",

These questions are mapped to topics with each topic having a handful of questions available.\r\n\r\nThe College Board has a few strict guidelines about how topic questions can be used. In particular, students may not receive a grade based on performance on topic questions nor can they be used for teacher evaluation. Beyond these requirements, however, they are primarily intended to formatively assess student progress and learning as they prepare for the end of course exam.\r\n\r\nWithin our own course we recommend that you use them in a variety of ways:\r\n\r\n* Throughout the unit assign topic questions to students related to the topics students are learning about that day or that week\r\n* Prior to the unit assessment assign topic questions to help students practice and prepare for the summative assessment\r\n* After the unit assessment use these topic questions to help students track their progress towards preparation for the AP assessment\r\n\r\n![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/Screenshot-2020-03-06-at-7.39.15-PM.png)\r\n\r\nClick for more info: [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dqYF5u0AULjw049gaCwAP34ZSe0VuEWbAjWoH1-YMW0/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n"
