Then, students form groups and are given a scenario involving their persona and generative AI.

The goal of this lesson is _not_ to become an expert on each framework, nor is it to become an expert on ethical thinking in general. Instead, the hope is students start to recognize that anytime they make a choice, that choice is influenced by covert factors on how they see and value the world **and those values have names**. For example:\n\n- Deciding to do something because \"it's what most of us want\" has a name - Utilitarianism.\n- Or, deciding _not_ to do something because \"first, do no harm\" has a name - Care-Based Ethics. \n\nBy introducing students to these frameworks, we give them the language to talk about these values so they can see how they are informing the decisions they (and others) are making. And, they can also start to see other ways of thinking that might lead to different decisions that they may not have previously considered."

Here's the big picture behind this activity:\n- Students are [participating in a **collaborative game**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rqtfMZyn-UekUoVFgYCHyVqOa7StNY9-wl-FlLOaZqk/edit#heading=h.59k2gm16lgj2), where each person takes on a specific role or persona and they all have to work together to \"win\" against the scenario set out by the game. This is similar in spirit to board games like [Pandemic](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30549/pandemic) or [Forbidden Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbidden_Island_(game))\n- Students will be in groups of 4, where all four people have taken on a persona [related to a specific scenario](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-bJpL4tXOgg6jpGhiXTCxowVh_ogsNmd-K-S64Nb4lo/edit#heading=h.59k2gm16lgj2). Their goal will be to work together to come up with guidelines for Generative AI that try to satisfy the needs and goals of everyone in the group. \n  - For example: an actor, a producer, an audience member, and a costume designer must work together to come up with guidelines for use of Generative AI in movie productions.\n- Each student has a particular persona they can embody on a [Character Card](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dliLfkCYxPTfdo7kirgSBODCn94C092z_tTwE_C2SbA/edit). These cards include some baseline information about how this person might feel about generative AI, along with some [news articles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fFsIddVKKTvl067o0GpW0PsjampUbdNAGeptVbtDl6I/edit) that students read and react to _as this character_.\n\n\nEven though the ultimate goal is to be in a group as a character solving a problem, the lesson plan introduces these steps in stages rather than explaining the full game all-at-once. First students are introduced to their character and read their news articles. Once they understand their character, then they form their groups and are given their scenario. And once they understand their scenario, they can begin the collaborative game of coming up with guidelines for generative AI."
