Your students will be able to create working code which they can test out in the simulator before transferring them to a real micro:bit over a USB cable. They can then unplug the micro:bit from the computer, attach a battery pack, and use their projects anywhere.\n\nBy making micro:bit projects, your students can take their code off the screen and make self-contained physical devices they can hold in the palm of their hands, making abstract computing concepts tangible.",

Does anyone have a favorite dance move?*\n\t- *Have you ever watched a dance team perform to music together? How do they stay in sync?*\n\t\t- *One way to do this might be to plan out all of the moves in advance. It's almost like the dancers are programmed! Computer scientists would call this an algorithm because it's a list of steps to get something done.*\n\t\t- *Another way to keep in sync is to have a cue that tells everyone when to change to a different move. Everyone would still need to know what moves to perform and agree on what the cues mean.*\n\t- *If I want everyone in class to clap at the exact same time, I could do that by giving you a countdown from 3.* (Try it!) \n\t- *When I reached \"1\", that was the event that gave you all the signal to clap.*\n- Ask the class if they can think of any other events that could give signals.\n\t- You may need to remind them that you're not talking about an event like a birthday party or a field trip.\n\t- If they have trouble, you can remind them that an event is an action that causes something to happen.\n\t\t- Blowing a whistle\n\t\t- Waving a flag\n\t\t- Saying a magic word\n\t\t- Pressing a button\n- *Today, we're going to organize our class dance party using events.*",

This means students will see their own code as they move between bubbles 6-10, allowing for more personal customization that will carry all the way to the final product.\n\nIn the final stage of this lesson students are able to tweak their game to make it unique - encourage them to see how different they can make each game within the constraints provided. If the class doesn't use pair programming, then tell students to go around and look at other student's games. Otherwise, have students discuss and try out different ways to set up their game with their partner.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: Show “Code Your Own Flappy Game” video\n",
