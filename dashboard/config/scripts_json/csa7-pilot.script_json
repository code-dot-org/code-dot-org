Students will have three class periods to develop and refine their program. Lessons 11, 12, and 13 collectively include instructions for managing each day of the three-day project work time.\n\nIf there is not enough time for the three-day project work time, a one-day option achieves the targeted learning objectives and goals. If using this option, refer to the [**Title Sequence Project 1 Day Lesson Plan**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16Cgn1mYTCJEvwBDncZm1DfV5y_Zq2TZo-eL1HBz4-x4/edit?usp=sharing). Direct students to develop their program on Code Studio in Lesson 13 so they can submit their project. While the one-day option covers the learning objectives and goals, it shortens development time. Consider this tradeoff when deciding which version to use."
