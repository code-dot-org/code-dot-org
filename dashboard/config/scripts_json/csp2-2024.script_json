So why not get to know it?\" But you don't have to take Vint Cerf's word for it. Some of the largest issues facing society hinge on an understanding of how the Internet functions.\n\nAt the end of this unit you will do a project focusing on a societal issue. As you go through these lessons keep you ears and eyes open for how things work.\n\nMany of the issues are related to people taking advantage of the open protocols that make the Internet function and present us with tricky dilemmas. We will learn about protocols later in this unit. \n\nFor example, there are two major issues to think about:\n\n* Net Neutrality is a raging legal debate about the principle that Internet service providers should enable access to all content and applications regardless of the source, and without favoring or blocking particular products or websites.\n\n* Internet Censorship is the attempt to control or suppress what can be accessed, published, or viewed on the Internet by certain people. This can be used to protect people (i.e. to not allow access to child pornography) but can also be used to limit free speech.\n\nIn order to have an informed opinion, it helps to understand the technical underpinnings of how the internet works.\n\nFinally, a major issue that our society faces is that far too few people actually understand how the Internet works! We are going to change that over the next few lessons.",

There is a ‘Teacher View’ button you can use to see the username of who sent individual messages (see below)\r\n\r\n* Avoid Downtime: Unstructured time in the lesson can lead to off-task messages.

These questions are mapped to topics with each topic having a handful of questions available.\n\nThe College Board has a few strict guidelines about how topic questions can be used. In particular, students may not receive a grade based on performance on topic questions nor can they be used for teacher evaluation. Beyond these requirements, however, they are primarily intended to formatively assess student progress and learning as they prepare for the end of course exam.\n\nWithin our own course we recommend that you use them in a variety of ways:\n\n* Throughout the unit assign topic questions to students related to the topics students are learning about that day or that week\n* Prior to the unit assessment assign topic questions to help students practice and prepare for the summative assessment\n* After the unit assessment use these topic questions to help students track their progress towards preparation for the AP assessment\n\n![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/topics2.png)\n\nClick for more info: [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l9VDL92DCIbTNhTiLGIr-enBOTM4wEDTTQOBlJ7bBhM/edit?usp=share_link)\n\n"
