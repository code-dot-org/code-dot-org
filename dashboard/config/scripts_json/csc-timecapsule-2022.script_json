Students will have various examples of time capsule stories to choose from, ranging from the moon landing to the first iPad to the COVID-19 pandemic. Students will practice using code blocks to set a background, set text effects, create sprites with behaviors, play sounds, and trigger events to occur during certain lines of the text.",

This lesson is designed to give students an opportunity to tinker with their code and find the visual effects that they like best. \n\nWhile circling the room, encourage students to:\n- **Take Your Time:** Most of the levels require students to find the perfect effects to match their interpretation of the mood of the time capsule story. Staying on a level and tinkering with their code is highly encouraged.\n\n- **Show off a completed level:** Any level bubble that is fully green means the student successfully completed all the requirements for that level. Ask a student to click on a green bubble to show off what they created. \n\nFor the times when a student feels stuck: \n- **Collaborate with Neighbors:** Encourage students to check in with a neighbor when they're getting stuck. Depending on the age and ability of your students, you might consider formally breaking your class into pairs to complete the tutorial using pair programming.\n- **Read the Instructions:** The instructions are bulleted points on how to complete the level. If a student feels stuck, ask them to read the instructions out loud to you and ask them to repeat back what the instructions say in their own words. \n  - <img src=\"https://images.code.org/5b99c663ad6632fe64c9da69d6805c2b-text-to-speech.PNG\" style=\"height: 25px;\"> Students can also click on this text-to-speech icon to hear the instructions read aloud.\n- <img src=\"https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/hint.png\" style=\"height: 35px;\"> **Look for hints**: Most levels include at least one hint with more explicit details about how to pass the level. \n- **Celebrate bugs:** Getting a bug in your code is a natural part of the coding process. If the program isn’t doing what they expected, ask the student to first tell you what they want to happen, click run to observe what is actually happening, then find the place in their code that caused the discrepancy. Remember to celebrate finding bugs and fixing bugs. Getting a bug means students are doing a great job building a more complex program. "

Explain to students the different text effect block options. Again, support time management. Consider setting a 2 minute timer when all students must move on to the next level. \n\n**Level 5**: Students may need headphones to listen to the various sound options. If there are no headphones available, remind students to use a low volume that is respectful of the other students. \n\n**Level 6**: Students will explore **sprites** in this level. Remind them of the meaning of this vocabulary word. Students will require continued time management support. Consider that this is about halfway through the level progression.\n\n**Level 7**: Decide whether to watch this video all together as a class or allow students to watch it independently at their computers. The skill building shown in this Poem Art video is applicable to how students will be coding their digital time capsule story. This is a good stopping point for students to share with a partner what they have done so far.",

The items were all kept safe from damage because they were kept indoors.\n\nCons - It costs a lot of money to rent an apartment for 70 years. No one might know to go look inside the apartment. \n\n**Plymouth Belvedere Sport Coupe**\n\nPros - A lot of people love vintage cars; this is an interesting item to preserve. It would be interesting to compare old cars to cars today.\n\nCons - This time capsule was completely ruined by water. It hasn’t been possible to restore it and museums don’t even want to show it because of too much water damage.\n\n**Space Time Capsule**\n\nPros - They used images to communicate with someone in any language. They used strong materials so that it could withstand traveling through space.\n\nCons - It is unknown whether anyone will ever receive this time capsule.\n",

Depending on the age and ability of your students, you might consider formally breaking your class into pairs to complete the tutorial using pair programming.\n- **Read the Instructions:** The instructions are bulleted points on how to complete the level. If a student feels stuck, ask them to read the instructions out loud to you and ask them to repeat back what the instructions say in their own words. \n  - <img src=\"https://images.code.org/5b99c663ad6632fe64c9da69d6805c2b-text-to-speech.PNG\" style=\"height: 25px;\"> Students can also click on this text-to-speech icon to hear the instructions read aloud.\n- <img src=\"https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/hint.png\" style=\"height: 35px;\"> **Look for hints**: Most levels include at least one hint with more explicit details about how to pass the level. \n- **Celebrate bugs:** Getting a bug in your code is a natural part of the coding process. If the program isn’t doing what they expected, ask the student to first tell you what they want to happen, click run to observe what is actually happening, then find the place in their code that caused the discrepancy. Remember to celebrate finding bugs and fixing bugs. Getting a bug means students are doing a great job building a more complex program. "
