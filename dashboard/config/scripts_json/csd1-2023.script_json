Students are then shown the four steps of the problem-solving process and work together to relate these abstract steps to their actual experiences solving problems. First students relate these steps to the problem activities from the previous lesson, then a problem they are good at solving, then a problem they want to improve at solving.

You might consider administering it on an admin day at school, or as an early homework.\n\n**When should I give the survey?** Because it is a pre-course survey it is important that students take it as early in the course as possible before they have had much (or any) exposure to the class so that we may accurately gauge changes in attitudes and beliefs caused by the course.",

Run this conversation as a brainstorm, recording ideas on the board. Note and call out similarities in characteristics.  Students may come up with counter examples for some of the common characteristics.  Remind them that you are brainstorming and that it's important to consider all of the possible ideas, and that they will have more time to think about this question in the lesson.\n\n**Discussion Goal:** This warm-up starts students thinking about what the defining characteristics of a computer are. Students do not need to have a definition of a computer, but they should start to think about the different types of computers in their lives and what they have in common.\n\n**Note:** The programmers pictured are Elizabeth Jean Jennings Bartik and Frances Bilas Spence. The computer pictured is the ENIAC."

On the left side they can make a rough sketch of what their app would look like. This does not need to be a final draft and is just there to help them brainstorm ideas and communicate to another group how their app would look. On the right side they have space to label each individual piece of information on the screen.\n\nUsing the outputs that students selected as a guide, students should pick the inputs they'll need to create them. Only 6 spaces are provided though students could opt to choose more. This is somewhat intentional to help students scope the functionality of their app.\n\nStudents will describe the way their app processes data using as a model the way they would process it themselves. The goal here is primarily just to ensure students have selected inputs that could be processed to produce the outputs. For example, if they're finding a list of friends with birthdays this month then both a computer and human would need to know a list of friends' birthdays and the current month.\n\nLastly students are asked to decide what information, if any, it makes sense to store long term.\n\n**Distribute:** Apps and Problem Solving - Peer Review, one copy to each pair of students\n\n**Step 7: Peer Review**: Each group should trade their project guides with another. They should fill out the first line of the peer review which asks what specific part of their project they'd like feedback on. Afterward, there are a number of directed questions as well as a chance to provide more open-ended feedback on the idea.\n\nStudents should be given their project guides back as well as their peer feedback.

        "description": "#### Ensure you are registered on Code Studio as a \"verified\" teacher account\n\nAnyone can create a teacher account on Code Studio, which means that we need an extra layer of authorization to allow CS Discoveries teachers to see assessments, answer keys, and any other collateral that students should not be able to trivially get access to. If you attended a Code.org professional learning workshop during the summer, you should already have this access.\n\nTo check whether you have access:\n\n1. Navigate to the [Unit 1 course overview page](https://studio.code.org/s/csd1-2023)\n2. Do you see the CS Discoveries Pre-course Survey as the first \"stage\" of the course?\n3. If not, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdGGAJuaDMBVIRYnimPhAL96w6fCl4UdvhwmynGONM75TWwWw/viewform). Note that it can take a day or so to become a verified teacher account, so please do this step early!\n\nIf you are *not* a verified teacher account, you can still create a section for your class, but you will not be able to administer the pre-course survey on the first day.\n\n\n#### Create a class section on Code Studio.\n\nTo create a section:\n\n1. Navigate to the [Teacher Home Page](https://studio.code.org/home)\n2. Click 'New section' under 'Classroom Sections'\n3. Choose 'Email Logins' \n4. In the space provided, give your section a name (e.g. CSD Period 1), the grade of your students, Course: 'Computer Science Discoveries', Current Unit: 'Unit 1: Problem Solving', and click 'Save'\n5. Once the section is created, click the name of the section\n6. On the new page, you will see a unique Join URL that you will distribute to your students in class. \n\nFor a video walkthrough of these steps and more on navigating your Code.org account, go to the [Code.org How-to Video Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7-6SpcrToamXzSMUKkEYZfKTzi6gJos5)",

You might consider administering it on an admin day at school, or as an early homework.\n\n**When should I give the survey?** Because it is a pre-course survey it is important that students take it as early in the course as possible before they have had much (or any) exposure to the class so that we may accurately gauge changes in attitudes and beliefs caused by the course.",

If you attended a Code.org professional learning workshop during the summer, you should already have this access.\n\nTo check whether you have access:\n\n1. Navigate to the [Unit 1 course overview page](https://studio.code.org/s/csd1-2023)\n2. Do you see the CS Discoveries Pre-course Survey as the first \"stage\" of the course?\n3. If not, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdGGAJuaDMBVIRYnimPhAL96w6fCl4UdvhwmynGONM75TWwWw/viewform). Note that it can take a day or so to become a verified teacher account, so please do this step early!\n\nIf you are *not* a verified teacher account, you can still create a section for your class, but you will not be able to administer the pre-course survey on the first day.\n\n\n#### Create a class section on Code Studio.\n\nTo create a section:\n\n1. Navigate to the [Teacher Home Page](https://studio.code.org/home)\n2. Click 'New section' under 'Classroom Sections'\n3. Choose 'Email Logins' \n4. In the space provided, give your section a name (e.g. CSD Period 1), the grade of your students, Course: 'Computer Science Discoveries', Current Unit: 'Unit 1: Problem Solving', and click 'Save'\n5. Once the section is created, click the name of the section\n6. On the new page, you will see a unique Join URL that you will distribute to your students in the class. \n\nFor a video walkthrough of these steps and more on navigating your Code.org account, go to the [Code.org How-to Video Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7-6SpcrToamXzSMUKkEYZfKTzi6gJos5)",

If you attended a Code.org professional learning workshop during the summer, you should already have this access.\n\nTo check whether you have access:\n\n1. Navigate to the [Unit 1 course overview page](https://studio.code.org/s/csd1-2023)\n2. Do you see the CS Discoveries Pre-course Survey as the first \"stage\" of the course?\n3. If not, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdGGAJuaDMBVIRYnimPhAL96w6fCl4UdvhwmynGONM75TWwWw/viewform). Note that it can take a day or so to become a verified teacher account, so please do this step early!\n\nIf you are *not* a verified teacher account, you can still create a section for your class, but you will not be able to administer the pre-course survey on the first day.\n\n\n#### Create a class section on Code Studio.\n\nTo create a section:\n\n1. Navigate to the [Teacher Home Page](https://studio.code.org/home)\n2. Click 'New section' under 'Classroom Sections'\n3. Choose 'Email Logins' \n4. In the space provided, give your section a name (e.g. CSD Period 1), the grade of your students, Course: 'Computer Science Discoveries', Current Unit: 'Unit 1: Problem Solving', and click 'Save'\n5. Once the section is created, click the name of the section\n6. On the new page, you will see a unique Join URL that you will distribute to your students in the class. \n\nFor a video walkthrough of these steps and more on navigating your Code.org account, go to the [Code.org How-to Video Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7-6SpcrToamXzSMUKkEYZfKTzi6gJos5).",

(And why does that problem exist?) Keep asking to get to the heart of the problem.\n* How could I be able to tell the problem had been solved? What could I observe or measure?\n\n"
