So why not get to know it?\" But you don't have to take Vint Cerf's word for it. Some of the largest issues facing society hinge on an understanding of how the Internet functions.\n\nAt the end of this unit you will do a project focusing on a societal issue. As you go through these lessons keep you ears and eyes open for how things work.\n\nMany of the issues are related to people taking advantage of the open protocols that make the Internet function and present us with tricky dilemmas. We will learn about protocols later in this unit. \n\nFor example, there are two major issues to think about:\n\n* Net Neutrality is a raging legal debate about the principle that Internet service providers should enable access to all content and applications regardless of the source, and without favoring or blocking particular products or websites.\n\n* Internet Censorship is the attempt to control or suppress what can be accessed, published, or viewed on the Internet by certain people. This can be used to protect people (i.e. to not allow access to child pornography) but can also be used to limit free speech.\n\nIn order to have an informed opinion, it helps to understand the technical underpinnings of how the internet works.\n\nFinally, a major issue that our society faces is that far too few people actually understand how the Internet works! We are going to change that over the next few lessons.",

You'll actually probably want to start with the bottom of your review guide.\n\n**Discussion Goal:** Use this final discussion to review not just this lesson but every protocol / layer of the Internet students have learned so far. You'd aim to see responses like the following \n\n* When you type in code.org, your browser will contact the DNS to find Code.org's IP address\n* When you receive the address you'll send an HTTP GET request to code.org to send you its homepage\n* Code.org's server will respond with the HTML code that makes up its web page\n* All of the communications above happen on the Internet which means TCP or UDP will break the message into packets and then send them. If TCP is used, error checking will occur.\n* IP will route the packets back and forth between your computer and the server\n* All of this information is sent over the physical wires, cable, wifi networks, and routers that make up the physical network of the internet.\n\n",
