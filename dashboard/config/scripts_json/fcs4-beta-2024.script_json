So why not get to know it?\" But you don't have to take Vint Cerf's word for it. Some of the largest issues facing society hinge on an understanding of how the Internet functions.\n\nAt the end of this unit you will do a project focusing on a societal issue. As you go through these lessons keep you ears and eyes open for how things work.\n\nMany of the issues are related to people taking advantage of the open protocols that make the Internet function and present us with tricky dilemmas. We will learn about protocols later in this unit. \n\nFor example, there are two major issues to think about:\n\n* Net Neutrality is a raging legal debate about the principle that Internet service providers should enable access to all content and applications regardless of the source, and without favoring or blocking particular products or websites.\n\n* Internet Censorship is the attempt to control or suppress what can be accessed, published, or viewed on the Internet by certain people. This can be used to protect people (i.e. to not allow access to child pornography) but can also be used to limit free speech.\n\nIn order to have an informed opinion, it helps to understand the technical underpinnings of how the internet works.\n\nFinally, a major issue that our society faces is that far too few people actually understand how the Internet works! We are going to change that over the next few lessons.",

There is a ‘Teacher View’ button you can use to see the username of who sent individual messages (see below)\r\n\r\n* Avoid Downtime: Unstructured time in the lesson can lead to off-task messages. As best as you can, try to keep the pace of the lesson moving so there is always something for students to do\r\n\r\n* Provide Specific Prompts: This lesson includes several specific types of messages for students to send.

The depth of explanation in the slides is sufficient to explain the differences between them and why each would be used.\n\nTo encourage active engagement and reflection, use one or more of the strategies discussed in the [**Guide to Curriculum Videos**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f8IkB75jpoFHg48FAtC8Kz1pD-5P7DKIGOytJM6o2oM/edit?usp=sharing).\n"
