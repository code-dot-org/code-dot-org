        "description": "### Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy\n\n\n* **A Break from Programming:** This unit is intentionally designed as a short respite from programming. After three units and a major hackathon project, it is a great opportunity to get away from screens for a while before the final programming push that leads to the Create PT.\n\n* **Just Enough Math:** This unit includes some mathematical concepts which enrich students' understanding of how algorithms are analyzed, which might at first be a little intimidating to some students (and teachers!). The mathematical topics included in this unit are only those necessary to provide a solid foundation in algorithmic analysis to the depth described in the CS Principles framework. If you are a teacher with a strong mathematical background, check carefully that you do not needlessly add complexity to a unit that might already prove challenging for some students. All teachers should keep an eye out for the ways visuals, hands-on examples, and patterns in presentation style are used to ensure a consistent presentation of these mathematical topics.\n\n\n### Major Assessment and Projects\n\nThis unit does not conclude with a major project. Students will complete an end-of-unit assessment that is aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n\n### AP Connections\n\nThis unit helps build towards the enduring understandings listed below. For a detailed mapping of units to Learning Objectives and EKs, please see the \"Standards\" page for this unit.\n\n* AAP-2: The way statements are sequenced and combined in a program determines the computed result. Programs incorporate iteration and selection constructs to represent repetition and make decisions to handle varied input values.\n* AAP-4: There exist problems that computers cannot solve, and even when a computer can solve a problem, it may not be able to do so in a reasonable amount of time.\n* CSN-2: Parallel and distributed computing leverage multiple computers to more quickly solve complex problems or process large data sets.\n\nThis unit includes content from the following topics from the AP CS Principles Framework. For more detailed information on topic coverage in the course review [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RniAGymLBBpIpDaNNR5Ea8CgiiUKv0tMvaDixSj6m_Q/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n* 3.9 Developing Algorithms\n* 3.11 Binary Search\n* 3.17 Algorithmic Efficiency\n* 3.18 Undecidable Problems\n* 4.3 Parallel and Distributed Computing"

For this one it's very easy to just yell out what number you would pair with and lose the opporuntity to see how many total checks are necessary if they can just all yell from their seats.\r\n* The group raffle doesn't necessarily need to be silent. As students will see, it's an incredibly difficult problem and they're going to need to do a lot of checking even if they're able to talk out loud.\r\n* Think ahead about whether you actually want to award winners of the raffles. It's pretty unlikely that there will be a winner. \r\n* There's a pretty good chance that no one will win either raffle.\r\n"

Read through the rules together as a class. <br><br>**Rules:**<br><ul><li>You must start and end at your own house.</li><li>You can only visit each house once.</li></ul><br><br>**Discuss:** Students share their paths with a partner before discussing as a class. |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-6---Algorithms2.svg) | **Say:** Take a look at some of these paths on the screen. You may have similar ones in your journal. <br><br> **Discuss:** What do you need to know to determine the best path?   |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-6---Algorithms3.svg) | **Say:** Distance! If we know the distance between each house, we can make a better decision about which path to take. In this example, the first option is shortest, so that's the path we would choose. |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-6---Algorithms4.svg) | **Discuss:** What if we had a lot more places to visit? How would we determine the best path? <br><br> **Discussion Goal:** The goal here is for students to come to the realization that they would need to explore all possible paths in order to determine which one is the best.   |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-6---Algorithms5.svg) | **Say:** This is known as the Traveling Salesman Problem. For each new place to visit, the number of options for possible paths increases factorialy.  |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-6---Algorithms6.svg) | **Say:** A factorial function is written with the letter \"n\" followed by an explanation point. Here's how n! works: Multiply all whole numbers from the given number down to the number 1.<br><br>**Note:** Talk through the examples and the table. The goal here isn't for students to memorize the math, but to understand that with each new house added, the number of potential paths that have to be checked expands very quickly.  | \n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-6---AlgorithmsDecisions.svg) | **Say:** The Traveling Salesman is an Optimization Problem. It's not a Decision Problem. We know there is a path. Now we must determine which is the shortest or most efficient path. |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-6---Algorithms7.svg) | **Say:** The Traveling Salesman Problem can be solved with an algorithm, which checks each possible option. <br><br> BUT, it would take massive amounts of computing power to compare every single option, especially as the number of homes to visit (otherwise known as nodes) increases. <br><br> Therefore, it would take an **unreasonable** amount of time for the solution to be calculated for most instances of the problem. \n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-6---Algorithms8.svg) | **Say:** Welcome to **heuristics**!

These questions are mapped to topics with each topic having a handful of questions available.\r\n\r\nThe College Board has a few strict guidelines about how topic questions can be used. In particular, students may not receive a grade based on performance on topic questions nor can they be used for teacher evaluation. Beyond these requirements, however, they are primarily intended to formatively assess student progress and learning as they prepare for the end of course exam.\r\n\r\nWithin our own course we recommend that you use them in a variety of ways:\r\n\r\n* Throughout the unit assign topic questions to students related to the topics students are learning about that day or that week\r\n* Prior to the unit assessment assign topic questions to help students practice and prepare for the summative assessment\r\n* After the unit assessment use these topic questions to help students track their progress towards preparation for the AP assessment\r\n\r\n![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/topics6.png)\r\n\r\nClick for more info: [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dqYF5u0AULjw049gaCwAP34ZSe0VuEWbAjWoH1-YMW0/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n"
