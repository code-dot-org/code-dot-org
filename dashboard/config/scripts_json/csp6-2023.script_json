        "description": "### Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy\n\n\n* **A Break from Programming:** This unit is intentionally designed as a short respite from programming. After three units and a major hackathon project, it is a great opportunity to get away from screens for a while before the final programming push that leads to the Create PT.\n\n* **Just Enough Math:** This unit includes some mathematical concepts which enrich students' understanding of how algorithms are analyzed, which might at first be a little intimidating to some students (and teachers!). The mathematical topics included in this unit are only those necessary to provide a solid foundation in algorithmic analysis to the depth described in the CS Principles framework. If you are a teacher with a strong mathematical background, check carefully that you do not needlessly add complexity to a unit that might already prove challenging for some students. All teachers should keep an eye out for the ways visuals, hands-on examples, and patterns in presentation style are used to ensure a consistent presentation of these mathematical topics.\n\n\n### Major Assessment and Projects\n\nThis unit does not conclude with a major project. Students will complete an end-of-unit assessment that is aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n\n### AP Connections\n\nThis unit helps build towards the enduring understandings listed below. For a detailed mapping of units to Learning Objectives and EKs, please see the \"Standards\" page for this unit.\n\n* AAP-2: The way statements are sequenced and combined in a program determines the computed result. Programs incorporate iteration and selection constructs to represent repetition and make decisions to handle varied input values.\n* AAP-4: There exist problems that computers cannot solve, and even when a computer can solve a problem, it may not be able to do so in a reasonable amount of time.\n* CSN-2: Parallel and distributed computing leverage multiple computers to more quickly solve complex problems or process large data sets.\n\nThis unit includes content from the following topics from the AP CS Principles Framework. For more detailed information on topic coverage in the course review [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RniAGymLBBpIpDaNNR5Ea8CgiiUKv0tMvaDixSj6m_Q/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n* 3.9 Developing Algorithms\n* 3.11 Binary Search\n* 3.17 Algorithmic Efficiency\n* 3.18 Undecidable Problems\n* 4.3 Parallel and Distributed Computing"

        "description": "### Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy\n\n* **Independent Creation and The Hackathon Project:** Much like the project in Unit 4, the \"Hackathon\" project in this unit is designed as an opportunity for students to creatively and independently build something with their programming skills. While students are asked to include some technical requirements in their program to ensure they demonstrate mastery of new programming concepts, they have free rein to choose the goals, design, and implementation of their project. To avoid asking students to complete a major programming project right before the Create PT, this hackathon is the most \"Create-PT-like\" project of the course. It is the best chance for students to practice skills like budgeting time or scoping an open-ended project. In many classrooms, if you maintain the recommended pacing of the course, this project serves as an excellent end to the first semester.\n\n* **Growing Comfort with EIPM:** By Unit 5, students (and teachers!) should be developing greater comfort with the flow of EIPM lessons. Students may begin to anticipate that sequences build towards an independent Make lesson or look forward to stepping away from computers to Explore. A nice feature of EIPM is that you will find strategies and modifications to each lesson type that work best for your students. Keep an eye out for how you and your students are developing comfort with EIPM and note strategies that help meet your classroom's needs.\n\n* **Programming with Real-world Data:** The Data Library is a new feature in App Lab for the 2020-21 school year and was designed to let students program with data from the real world. This tool aims to motivate students to build new kinds of data-powered apps that they find personally interesting. This tool also facilitates programming with lists of information since students will need to manipulate lists of data to incorporate the different data sources. Encourage students to use datasets they find personally relevant as they draw on their creative ideas for bringing data to life.\n\n\n\n### Major Assessment and Projects\n\nThe unit project asks students to spend five days as part of a \"Hackathon\" project that they have nearly complete independence to scope and design. Students must choose one dataset from the Data Library in AppLab to be a component of their project to demonstrate what they have learned about lists and list processing; otherwise, scoping the project is completely up to them. Students submit their app, project guide, and written responses to reflection questions about how the app is designed and the development process they used to make it. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n\n### AP Connections\n\nThis unit and unit project helps build towards the enduring understandings listed below. For a detailed mapping of units to Learning Objectives and EKs, please see the \"Standards\" page for this unit.\n\n* CRD-2: Developers create and innovate using an iterative design process that is user-focused, incorporating implementation/feedback cycles, which leaves ample room for experimentation and risk-taking.\n* AAP-1: To find specific solutions to generalizable problems, programmers represent and organize data in multiple ways.\n* AAP-2: The way statements are sequenced and combined in a program determines the computed result. Programs incorporate iteration and selection constructs to represent repetition and make decisions to handle varied input values.\n* AAP-3: Programmers break down problems into smaller and more manageable pieces. By creating procedures and leveraging parameters, programmers generalize processes that they can reuse. Procedures allow programmers to draw upon existing code that has already been tested, allowing them to write programs more quickly and more confidently.\n\nThis unit includes content from the following topics from the AP CS Principles Framework. For more detailed information on topic coverage in the course review [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RniAGymLBBpIpDaNNR5Ea8CgiiUKv0tMvaDixSj6m_Q/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n* 3.2 Data Abstraction\n* 3.4 Strings\n* 3.8 Iteration\n* 3.10 Lists\n* 3.16 Simulations\n\nThe College Board has supplied formative Create PT questions to help prepare students to complete the Create Task. We recommend that students complete the following prompts with the unit project. More information can be found in Code.org CS Principles Topic Coverage.\n\n* 3.b.i\n* 3.b.ii\n* 3.b.iii\n* 3.b.iv\n* 3.b.v"

For this one it's very easy to just yell out what number you would pair with and lose the opporuntity to see how many total checks are necessary if they can just all yell from their seats.\r\n* The group raffle doesn't necessarily need to be silent. As students will see, it's an incredibly difficult problem and they're going to need to do a lot of checking even if they're able to talk out loud.\r\n* Think ahead about whether you actually want to award winners of the raffles.

For the group raffle it is a little more tricky but it's \"how many ways can I combine the dots?\"\r\n\r\n**8 is a Challenge:** The activity guide indicates that 8 is a challenge for both activities.

Often times a parallel solution will be the fastest option, but there is a limit. \r\n\r\nSolutions that use parallel computing can scale more effectively than solutions that use sequential computing. Why is this so? If we continue to add tasks, a sequential solution would continue to get larger and larger. However, with a parallel system, those tasks can be balanced.",

One of the most common errors with lists, therefore, is trying to access indexes that are out of bounds, most notably `list.length`,\n* Syntax errors are common with lists, as the bracket notation is new.

The model is typically that a term or concept is introduced and modeled and then afterwards students are encouraged to try it out on their own. Trying it out typically means they are writing information on a sticky note and sharing it with another group before discussing the results with the whole class.\n\nSlides with animations have an icon in the bottom left corner to let you know you need to click to reveal more of the slide's content. \n\nTo help you more easily prepare the activity and keep track of your instructions, detailed instructions have been included as speaker notes in the presentation. Here are some tips to help you throughout the presentation.\n\n* There are opportunities throughout the presentation for students to actively engage. At these moments students should be making things with their manipulatives or using them to answer questions. Use these opportunities to check progress.\n* There is a fair amount of new vocabulary introduced but it is introduced gradually and with intentional repetition. Make a point of actively modeling the use of new terms.\n* The most important goal here is building a mental model. It is ok if students have some open questions that will get resolved over the subsequent conditional lessons.\n* Both you and students can use the \"Key Takeaways\" to check your understanding at the end."

You will move a robot around a game board following commands. Here's the first one: [`moveForward()`(#4dd0e1)](/docs/applab/moveForward/). <br><br> **Do This:** Use this command to write a program to move the robot to the purple box. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click through animation to reveal the answer.** |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSPU5_Lists_Loops_Traversals_Loops2.png) | **Say:** This code is repetitive. How can we simplify it? By using a While Loop. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSPU5_Lists_Loops_Traversals_Loops3.png) | **Say:** Here's how a While Loop works. While something is true, the code in the while loop runs, over and over until that thing is no longer true. Let's try it together! |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSPU5_Lists_Loops_Traversals_Loops4.png) | **Say:** Let's run this program together. Set up your board with the robot in the same place as the robot on the screen. We are going to run each step of the loop together. First you will try it on your board, and then we will look at the answers on the screen. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSPU5_Lists_Loops_Traversals_Loops5.png) | **Say:** Read the code with your partner and complete the first round of the loop. You may want a sticky note or a scrap piece of paper out to keep track of the value in the variable. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click through to view the answer after students have had a chance to follow the code on their own board.

Here are some tips to help you throughout the presentation.\n\n* There are opportunities throughout the presentation for students to actively engage. At these moments students should be making things with their manipulatives or using them to answer questions. Use these opportunities to check progress.\n* There is a fair amount of new vocabulary introduced but it is introduced gradually and with intentional repetition. Make a point of actively modeling the use of new terms.\n* The most important goal here is building a mental model. It is ok if students have some open questions that will get resolved over the subsequent conditional lessons.\n* Both you and students can use the \"Key Takeaways\" to check your understanding at the end.\n\n"

Make sure you and your partner have all the supplies you see on the screen. <br><br> **Note to Teacher:** If you are concerned about time or material management, the Traversal Machines can be prepared ahead of time. You only need one Traversal Machine per pair of students, and machines can be shared between classes. <br><br> There are three places to make cuts: <br><ul><li>The dotted line at the top of the sheet</li><li>The box with the list index</li><li>The box inside of the variable baggy</li></ul>  |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals2.svg) | **Do This:** On a scrap piece of paper or a sticky note, write down the list on the screen.  |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals3.svg) | **Prompt:** What if I want to know if a value is in a list? With a partner, discuss the method you would use to look for an item in a list. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation to reveal suggested answer**|\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals4.svg) | **Say:** Computers are really good at checking things one by one. To do this... let's use a for loop.  |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals5.svg) | **Do This:** Set up the Traversal Machine. <br><br> **Note:** Students use scissors make cuts as directed on the Traversal Machines. As noted before, this can all be done before class to save time. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals6.svg) | **Do This:** Direct students attention to their Traversal Machines as you describe the parts. <br><br> **Say:** This is where we assign the starting value to the counter variable i. Usually we assign it to 0. What else starts with 0? The index of a list! <br><br> **Note:** In Javascript, the index of a list starts at 0. You may want to remind students that on the AP Exam, pseudocode starts the index at 1.|\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals7.svg) | **Say:** This is the Boolean expression that is checked to see if the loop should continue to run. When working with a list, we want to access every element in the list,s o we are going to keep the loop going until we have hit list.length. <br><br> **Note:** You may want to remind students that list.length evaluates to the length of a list, which will be different than the last index number. For example, in a list of three, the length is 3 and the index numbers are 0, 1, 2 |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals8.svg) | **Do This:** replace list with the name of your list. In this case, we would replace it with temps. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/Screen-Shot-2020-11-25-at-9.24.37-AM_C2zpJ9H.png) | **Say:** The counter variable i increases after each loop runs. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals9.svg) | **Say:** To access each element in the list, we are going to store the element in a variable inside the for loop. Let's try this out with your Traversal Machine. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> **Do This:** Set up a variable baggy and give it the name element. <br><br> **Note:** You may opt to not use variable baggies at all in this lesson and instead have students keep track of variables on a scrap piece of paper. In this case, the variable element is tracking the local variable that is inside of the for loop. With every round of the for loop, the variable will update. It's not necessary to build a baggy for the variable i - this will be represented on the Traversal Machine itself as a drawing of a baggy. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals10.svg) | **Do This:** Pull the index sheetu p to assign i to 0. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> **Say:** Notice how the variable in the baggy has changed.

No - so we exit out of the loop. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals16.svg) | **Say:** Are you starting to see a pattern here? <br><br><ul><li>We are able to access each item in a list by using a for loop.</li><li>This is called traversal. We are traveling or traversing through a list one element at a time.</li></ul>  |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals17.svg) | **Say:** Let's look for a number in the temps list. It's easy for you to scan the list quickly with your own eyes, but for this exercise, let's pretend you are a computer and must use the Traversal Machine to look for the number. <br><br> **Do this:** <br><ul><li>Write down the code to the left on a sticky note and put it in your for loop.</li><li> Pull the index sheet up each time you go through the loop.</li><li>Run the loop until it is finished</li><li>Your \"console\" can be a scrap piece of paper.</li><li>When done, compare your console with another group.</li></ul>  |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals18.svg) | **Say:** Check your console. Does it look like what you see on the screen? The number 85 was found at index 1, the second number in the list. Notice that i currently has the value 4. This is because we stopped after four rounds. Element is currently storing 65, the last element that we accessed, at index 3. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals19.svg) | **Say:** Now I want to find the smallest number in a list. I am going to reduce the list to the smallest number. We are going to leave the baggies behind now. You can use a scrap piece of paper to store the global variable <code>var min = temps[0]</code> <br><br> **Do This:** <br><ul><li>Evaluate that statement to find the value stored in min.</li><li>Run the program</li><li>Update the variable min as needed</li></ul> |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals20.svg) | **Say:** The smallest number in the list is 65. Again, this is easy for you to quickly scan with your eyes when your list is short, but imagine if your list contained 1,000 or 1,000,000 elements? This is where a computer using a loop really shines. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals21.svg) | **Say:** Let's make it more challenging. <br><br> **Do This:** <br><ul><li>With your partner, update the code inside the for loop to now find the largest number (max)</li><li>One partner creates a new list of 8 random numbers and keeps them hidden.</li><li>The other partner runs the Traversal Machine to find the largest number in the list by asking for each number one at a time. </li><li>Before beginning: <br><ul><li>store the global variable on a scrap piece of paper: <code>var max = temps[0];</code><li><li>Evaluate that statement to find the value stored in max. Ask your partner what is stored at \"temps index 0\"</li></ul><li>Run the for loop.</li><li>Check your answer at the end with your partner!</li></ul><br><br> **Note:** Read the example at the bottom of the screen out loud so students understand how they should interact while using the Traversal Machine. Allow students five or so minutes to fully complete the task on this slide. Here's a sample of what their updated code might look like: <br><br><code>if(element>max)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{max = element;<br>}</code>|\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals22_7ovsk3m.svg) | **Say:** Now I have a list of animals from which I want to filter some elements and store them in another list. <br><br> **Note:** Guide the students through the setup listed on the screen. <br><br> **Do This:** <br><ul><li>One partner creates a list of eight random animals, and stores it in the list animals on a scrap of paper. Keep this list hidden.</li><li>The other partner uses a separate scrap of paper to track a new list called animalsListA</li><li>Change the name of the list in the for loop of the Traversal Machine to animals.</li><li>Copy the code to the right on to a sticky note and place it in the for loop of the Traversal Machine.</li></ul>  |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals23.svg) | **Do This:** <br><ul><li>Run the code</li><li>Keep track of your console</li><li>When finished, trade your animal list with another group, run the code, and compare your console outputs</li></ul><br><br> **Note:** Expect this activity to take around 5 minutes.

Then as a class address any confusion over how the app works. \n\n* **The goal:** The goal of this investigation is to give students the opportunity to see lists traversed for different reasons and with different outcomes.   Students should look at the code for their assigned function and make sense of what the function does overall and how it does it.  \n* **What to look for:** It may be helpful to re-watch the [video](https://youtu.be/RQ6GJt9f2vg) in the U5L10 - Traversals Explore lesson starting at 3:07 to hear how the speaker describes a section of code that processes a list for a specific purpose.  Listening to that explanation will help give you an idea of what student explanations of their functions should sound like.  \n    \n    For example, when explaining the average function in this investigation, students should describe what the function does.  In this case, the function calculates the average of the values stored in the `mileTimes` list and stores that value in the `avg` variable. In addition to describing what the function does, students should describe how the function works.  This will involve more detail.  \n  * Students should be able to describe that the function contains a local variable of `total` which is initialized at 0.  \n  * Then the function uses a for loop to traverse through the `mileTimes` list.  In the loop, each value inside `mileTimes` list is accessed and added to the current value stored inside the total variable.  \n  * When the loop reaches the end of the list, the loop ends and the total variable contains the sum of all the `mileTimes`.  In the last line of the function, the value stored in `avg` is updated by dividing the value stored in `total` by the total number of elements in the `mileTimes` list.  \n\n    \n \nWhen you bring the class together to talk about how the app works, you should talk both about what the functions do as well as how they work.  There likely is not time to go over all four functions, but discussing one or two of them will ensure the full class has an opportunity to hear how their peers describe code.",

From that perspective, we also think it's appropriate to make choices about our content & curriculum that best suits your classroom. With that said, the Spotify dataset updates automatically every day according to the latest trends - we hope it provides a real-world social connection for students to engage with datasets, but also understand that we can't control the songs that make it to the top 200 and don't have the bandwidth to filter it on our end. If the songs for a particular day are not appropriate for your students, it may be a good idea to skip that dataset.\n"
