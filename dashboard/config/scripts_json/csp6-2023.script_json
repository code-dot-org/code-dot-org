The main challenges are that you’d need to make a variable for each piece of information and it could get difficult to name them all. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-20-21-U5-Lists-Explore-Slide-3.svg) | **Say:** Let's look at how to use lists |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-20-21-U5-Lists-Explore-Slide-4.svg) | **Say:** Today we’re going to practice using a new way to store information called a list. Follow the instructions here to make a list of your own. <br><br>**Do This:** Have students create their own list. Circulate the room to check on how they’re doing. Make sure they share with another group.|\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-20-21-U5-Lists-Explore-Slide-5.svg)| **Say:** Your list is made up of elements. Each element has its own index. Indexes are just numbers that count up from zero. The length of the list is how many elements it contains. This list has 3 elements and indexes from 0 to 2.|\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-20-21-U5-Lists-Explore-Slide-6.jpg)| **Say:** Notice that all the bags can folded up and be placed inside the big variable baggie. Sometimes we want to think about the whole list, sometimes we want to think about individual elements |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-20-21-U5-Lists-Explore-Slide-7.svg)| **Say:** We create a list with this command. It creates a new list and assigns it to a variable. The square brackets indicate we’re making a list. Each value is separated by commas. <br><br> **Do This:** Have students write the command to make their own list and the list of partner group. By sharing their answers with another group they can check that they’re following along.|\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-20-21-U5-Lists-Explore-Slide-8.svg) | **Say:** If we want to access the values in our list we use the square brackets next to the name of our list. <br><br> **Do This:** Have students discuss with other groups. They should see the answers are “nachos” and “soup” |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-20-21-U5-Lists-Explore-Slide-9.svg) | **Say:** We can use list accesses inside of expressions, just like variables. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> **Say:** This first expression evaluates to 23 because myNumbers[1] contains 20. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> **Say:** This second expression evaluates to 35 because myNumbers[0] and myNumbers[2] contain 25 and 10. <br><br> **Do This:** Have students write three expressions using their own lists. Then have them trade with another group to practice evaluating. Circulate the room to make sure students are following the directions correctly. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-20-21-U5-Lists-Explore-Slide-10.svg) | **Say:** We can assign the index of a list just like a variable. <Br><br> **Do This:** Have students discuss what the list will contain after line 02 runs. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> **Say:** This code will assign a new value at index 2 of the list. |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-20-21-U5-Lists-Explore-Slide-11.svg) |**Do This:** Circulate the room while students run this program <br><br>![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br>**Discuss:** Discuss quickly with the class why the program ends with the list shown.|\n|![](https://images.code.org/837c1d6a1d389a300e74cb5b1c4951e3-image-1641233752930.12.31 AM.png)| **Do This:** Circulate the room while students run this program <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br>**Discuss:** Discuss quickly with the class why the program ends with the list shown. <br><br> **Note:** Line 02 is tricky. You need to first evaluate myStuff[0] which is “dog”  to determine the value being assigned. Then evaluate myStuff[2], which is 3. At this point, the command reads myStuff[3] = “dog”.

Students should be given some time to explore the Data tab themselves and even try the “Modify” task for a few minutes.  \n    \n* **What to look for:** When you bring the class together, students should be able to describe what information they see in the data tab and how they can use the data tab to help get access to data.  Key points to draw out are:\n    \n    * The “Data Library” on the left hand side has different categories of datasets that students can view.\n    * Students need to “import” a data set to be able to see the data inside it or to use the data in the code.\n    * Once imported, students will see the data set in the “Data Browser” area and can click on the name of the Data Set to see the data in table form.\n    * To use the [`getColumn`(#d3e965)](/docs/applab/getColumn/) command, you need the name of the table you want to use and the name of the column from that table.\n    * [`getColumn`(#d3e965)](/docs/applab/getColumn/) will return the column from your table as a list.

Here are some tips to help you throughout the presentation.\n\n* There are opportunities throughout the presentation for students to actively engage. At these moments students should be making things with their manipulatives or using them to answer questions. Use these opportunities to check progress.\n* There is a fair amount of new vocabulary introduced but it is introduced gradually and with intentional repetition. Make a point of actively modeling the use of new terms.\n* The most important goal here is building a mental model. It is ok if students have some open questions that will get resolved over the subsequent conditional lessons.\n* Both you and students can use the \"Key Takeaways\" to check your understanding at the end."

Use these opportunities to check progress.\n* There is a fair amount of new vocabulary introduced but it is introduced gradually and with intentional repetition. Make a point of actively modeling the use of new terms.\n* The most important goal here is building a mental model.

Make sure you and your partner have all the supplies you see on the screen. <br><br> **Note to Teacher:** If you are concerned about time or material management, the Traversal Machines can be prepared ahead of time. You only need one Traversal Machine per pair of students, and machines can be shared between classes. <br><br> There are three places to make cuts: <br><ul><li>The dotted line at the top of the sheet</li><li>The box with the list index</li><li>The box inside of the variable baggy</li></ul>  |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals2.svg) | **Do This:** On a scrap piece of paper or a sticky note, write down the list on the screen.  |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals3.svg) | **Prompt:** What if I want to know if a value is in a list? With a partner, discuss the method you would use to look for an item in a list. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation to reveal suggested answer**|\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals4.svg) | **Say:** Computers are really good at checking things one by one. To do this... let's use a for loop.  |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals5.svg) | **Do This:** Set up the Traversal Machine. <br><br> **Note:** Students use scissors make cuts as directed on the Traversal Machines. As noted before, this can all be done before class to save time. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals6.svg) | **Do This:** Direct students attention to their Traversal Machines as you describe the parts. <br><br> **Say:** This is where we assign the starting value to the counter variable i. Usually we assign it to 0. What else starts with 0? The index of a list! <br><br> **Note:** In Javascript, the index of a list starts at 0. You may want to remind students that on the AP Exam, pseudocode starts the index at 1.|\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals7.svg) | **Say:** This is the Boolean expression that is checked to see if the loop should continue to run. When working with a list, we want to access every element in the list,s o we are going to keep the loop going until we have hit list.length. <br><br> **Note:** You may want to remind students that list.length evaluates to the length of a list, which will be different than the last index number. For example, in a list of three, the length is 3 and the index numbers are 0, 1, 2 |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals8.svg) | **Do This:** replace list with the name of your list. In this case, we would replace it with temps. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/Screen-Shot-2020-11-25-at-9.24.37-AM_C2zpJ9H.png) | **Say:** The counter variable i increases after each loop runs. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals9.svg) | **Say:** To access each element in the list, we are going to store the element in a variable inside the for loop. Let's try this out with your Traversal Machine. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> **Do This:** Set up a variable baggy and give it the name element. <br><br> **Note:** You may opt to not use variable baggies at all in this lesson and instead have students keep track of variables on a scrap piece of paper. In this case, the variable element is tracking the local variable that is inside of the for loop. With every round of the for loop, the variable will update. It's not necessary to build a baggy for the variable i - this will be represented on the Traversal Machine itself as a drawing of a baggy. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals10.svg) | **Do This:** Pull the index sheetu p to assign i to 0. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> **Say:** Notice how the variable in the baggy has changed. Each time the loop is executed, the variable i increases by one. <br><br> **Note:** For the following six slides, students will follow along with what's happening on the screen with their own Traversal Machines. Give students a few seconds to pull up the index sheet at each step. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals11.svg) | **Say:** Look at the list on the screen. Right now i=0. <br><br> **Do This:** Evaluate the statement in the for loop to see what value is stored by the variable element. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click through animation:** There are six steps to click through. <code>temps[0]</code> evaluates to 77 which is stored in the variable <code>element</code> |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals12.svg) | **Do This:** Now pull the index sheet up one spot. i now equals 1. Evaluate the statement inside the for loop. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click through animation:** There are seven steps to click through. <code>temps[1]</code> evaluates to 85 which is stored in the variable <code>element</code>  |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals13.svg) | **Do This:** Pull the index sheet up again. i now equals 2. Evaluate the statement inside the for loop. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click through animation:** There are seven steps to click through. <code>temps[2]</code> evaluates to 89 which is stored in the variable <code>element</code>  |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals14.svg) | **Do This:** Pull the index sheet up again. i now equals 3. Evaluate the statement inside the for loop. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click through animation:** There are seven steps to click through. <code>temps[3]</code> evaluates to 65 which is stored in the variable <code>element</code> |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals15.svg) | **Do This:** Now pull up the index sheet one last time. i now equals 4. <br><br> **Prompt:** What happens next? <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click through animation** There are three steps to click through. <br><br> **Say:** Is 4 less than 4 (the length of the list)? No - so we exit out of the loop. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals16.svg) | **Say:** Are you starting to see a pattern here? <br><br><ul><li>We are able to access each item in a list by using a for loop.</li><li>This is called traversal. We are traveling or traversing through a list one element at a time.</li></ul>  |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals17.svg) | **Say:** Let's look for a number in the temps list. It's easy for you to scan the list quickly with your own eyes, but for this exercise, let's pretend you are a computer and must use the Traversal Machine to look for the number. <br><br> **Do this:** <br><ul><li>Write down the code to the left on a sticky note and put it in your for loop.</li><li> Pull the index sheet up each time you go through the loop.</li><li>Run the loop until it is finished</li><li>Your \"console\" can be a scrap piece of paper.</li><li>When done, compare your console with another group.</li></ul>  |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals18.svg) | **Say:** Check your console. Does it look like what you see on the screen? The number 85 was found at index 1, the second number in the list. Notice that i currently has the value 4. This is because we stopped after four rounds. Element is currently storing 65, the last element that we accessed, at index 3. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals19.svg) | **Say:** Now I want to find the smallest number in a list. I am going to reduce the list to the smallest number. We are going to leave the baggies behind now. You can use a scrap piece of paper to store the global variable <code>var min = temps[0]</code> <br><br> **Do This:** <br><ul><li>Evaluate that statement to find the value stored in min.</li><li>Run the program</li><li>Update the variable min as needed</li></ul> |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals20.svg) | **Say:** The smallest number in the list is 65. Again, this is easy for you to quickly scan with your eyes when your list is short, but imagine if your list contained 1,000 or 1,000,000 elements? This is where a computer using a loop really shines. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals21.svg) | **Say:** Let's make it more challenging. <br><br> **Do This:** <br><ul><li>With your partner, update the code inside the for loop to now find the largest number (max)</li><li>One partner creates a new list of 8 random numbers and keeps them hidden.</li><li>The other partner runs the Traversal Machine to find the largest number in the list by asking for each number one at a time. </li><li>Before beginning: <br><ul><li>store the global variable on a scrap piece of paper: <code>var max = temps[0];</code><li><li>Evaluate that statement to find the value stored in max. Ask your partner what is stored at \"temps index 0\"</li></ul><li>Run the for loop.</li><li>Check your answer at the end with your partner!</li></ul><br><br> **Note:** Read the example at the bottom of the screen out loud so students understand how they should interact while using the Traversal Machine. Allow students five or so minutes to fully complete the task on this slide. Here's a sample of what their updated code might look like: <br><br><code>if(element>max)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{max = element;<br>}</code>|\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals22_7ovsk3m.svg) | **Say:** Now I have a list of animals from which I want to filter some elements and store them in another list. <br><br> **Note:** Guide the students through the setup listed on the screen. <br><br> **Do This:** <br><ul><li>One partner creates a list of eight random animals, and stores it in the list animals on a scrap of paper. Keep this list hidden.</li><li>The other partner uses a separate scrap of paper to track a new list called animalsListA</li><li>Change the name of the list in the for loop of the Traversal Machine to animals.</li><li>Copy the code to the right on to a sticky note and place it in the for loop of the Traversal Machine.</li></ul>  |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals23.svg) | **Do This:** <br><ul><li>Run the code</li><li>Keep track of your console</li><li>When finished, trade your animal list with another group, run the code, and compare your console outputs</li></ul><br><br> **Note:** Expect this activity to take around 5 minutes. When students have finished, move on to the Takeaways in the Wrap Up |"

Then as a class address any confusion over how the app works. \n\n* **The goal:** The goal of this investigation is to give students the opportunity to see lists traversed for different reasons and with different outcomes.   Students should look at the code for their assigned function and make sense of what the function does overall and how it does it.  \n* **What to look for:** It may be helpful to re-watch the [video](https://youtu.be/RQ6GJt9f2vg) in the U5L10 - Traversals Explore lesson starting at 3:07 to hear how the speaker describes a section of code that processes a list for a specific purpose.  Listening to that explanation will help give you an idea of what student explanations of their functions should sound like.  \n    \n    For example, when explaining the average function in this investigation, students should describe what the function does.  In this case, the function calculates the average of the values stored in the `mileTimes` list and stores that value in the `avg` variable. In addition to describing what the function does, students should describe how the function works.  This will involve more detail.  \n  * Students should be able to describe that the function contains a local variable of `total` which is initialized at 0.  \n  * Then the function uses a for loop to traverse through the `mileTimes` list.  In the loop, each value inside `mileTimes` list is accessed and added to the current value stored inside the total variable.  \n  * When the loop reaches the end of the list, the loop ends and the total variable contains the sum of all the `mileTimes`.  In the last line of the function, the value stored in `avg` is updated by dividing the value stored in `total` by the total number of elements in the `mileTimes` list.  \n\n    \n \nWhen you bring the class together to talk about how the app works, you should talk both about what the functions do as well as how they work.  There likely is not time to go over all four functions, but discussing one or two of them will ensure the full class has an opportunity to hear how their peers describe code.",

Check out the three apps in Code Studio to get a sense for how they work. Then move on to the Code Investigation and actually try to answer all the questions for each app.  These questions are intended to help students read and make sense of the code.  It is not about getting the “right answer” as much as it is about building skills in your students to read, test, and make sense of code that they haven’t seen before.  Finally, you will notice that for the levels where the directions ask students to “Modify” the code, you will find “Example Solutions” in the “Teacher Panel” of that level. \n\n**A Note About Datasets:** In general, one of our [Code.org Curriculum Values](https://code.org/educate/curriculum/values) is \"Teachers in Classrooms\" - we believe individual teachers have the best knowledge of their students and the content that will engage them. From that perspective, we also think it's appropriate to make choices about our content & curriculum that best suits your classroom. With that said, the Spotify dataset updates automatically every day according to the latest trends - we hope it provides a real-world social connection for students to engage with datasets, but also understand that we can't control the songs that make it to the top 200 and don't have the bandwidth to filter it on our end. If the songs for a particular day are not appropriate for your students, it may be a good idea to skip that dataset.\n"

These questions are mapped to topics with each topic having a handful of questions available.\r\n\r\nThe College Board has a few strict guidelines about how topic questions can be used. In particular, students may not receive a grade based on performance on topic questions nor can they be used for teacher evaluation. Beyond these requirements, however, they are primarily intended to formatively assess student progress and learning as they prepare for the end of course exam.\r\n\r\nWithin our own course we recommend that you use them in a variety of ways:\r\n\r\n* Throughout the unit assign topic questions to students related to the topics students are learning about that day or that week\r\n* Prior to the unit assessment assign topic questions to help students practice and prepare for the summative assessment\r\n* After the unit assessment use these topic questions to help students track their progress towards preparation for the AP assessment\r\n\r\n![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/topics5.png)\r\n\r\nClick for more info: [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dqYF5u0AULjw049gaCwAP34ZSe0VuEWbAjWoH1-YMW0/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n"
