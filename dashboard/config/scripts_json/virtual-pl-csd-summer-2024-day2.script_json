Challenge levels tend to focus on more open-ended tasks for students to complete, or opportunities to combine several skills from previous lessons together into one program.\n\nChallenge levels do **not** need to be completed for students to meet the core objectives of a lesson. Instead, every task in a challenge level is meant to supplement and enrich the learning objectives of a lesson, but are not required for future lessons. Students can still demonstrate mastery of the objectives of a lesson without completing any of the challenge levels.\n\n**Digging Deeper:** For more tips about programming levels, see the **[CSD Guide to Programming Levels](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LlbzDHvq_DXggzeGg_sBcNov9pZX7h9NqardkGW4ELw/view)**.
