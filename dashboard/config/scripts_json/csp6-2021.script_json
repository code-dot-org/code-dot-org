        "description": "### Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy\n\n\n* **A Break from Programming:** This unit is intentionally designed as a short respite from programming. After three units and a major hackathon project, it is a great opportunity to get away from screens for a while before the final programming push that leads to the Create PT.\n\n* **Just Enough Math:** This unit includes some mathematical concepts which enrich students' understanding of how algorithms are analyzed, which might at first be a little intimidating to some students (and teachers!). The mathematical topics included in this unit are only those necessary to provide a solid foundation in algorithmic analysis to the depth described in the CS Principles framework. If you are a teacher with a strong mathematical background, check carefully that you do not needlessly add complexity to a unit that might already prove challenging for some students. All teachers should keep an eye out for the ways visuals, hands-on examples, and patterns in presentation style are used to ensure a consistent presentation of these mathematical topics.\n\n\n### Major Assessment and Projects\n\nThis unit does not conclude with a major project. Students will complete an end-of-unit assessment that is aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n\n### AP Connections\n\nThis unit helps build towards the enduring understandings listed below. For a detailed mapping of units to Learning Objectives and EKs, please see the \"Standards\" page for this unit.\n\n* AAP-2: The way statements are sequenced and combined in a program determines the computed result. Programs incorporate iteration and selection constructs to represent repetition and make decisions to handle varied input values.\n* AAP-4: There exist problems that computers cannot solve, and even when a computer can solve a problem, it may not be able to do so in a reasonable amount of time.\n* CSN-2: Parallel and distributed computing leverage multiple computers to more quickly solve complex problems or process large data sets.\n\nThis unit includes content from the following topics from the AP CS Principles Framework. For more detailed information on topic coverage in the course review [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dqYF5u0AULjw049gaCwAP34ZSe0VuEWbAjWoH1-YMW0/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n* 3.9 Developing Algorithms\n* 3.11 Binary Search\n* 3.17 Algorithmic Efficiency\n* 3.18 Undecidable Problems\n* 4.3 Parallel and Distributed Computing"

In the first students answer a series of questions about birthdates and names of their classmates. They then discuss the similarities and differences between the problems.

At the end of the lesson they are introduced to the formal definitions of a problem and an algorithm.",

Students have been writing a lot of code, and now they are ready to think on a high level about the patterns that make two different problems, or two different algorithms, similar or different.

The longer the length of the list being searched, the more efficient Binary Search is compared to Linear Search. That said, Binary Search has a constraint: the list must first be sorted. This lesson more broadly introduces students to thinking about the efficiency of an algorithm, an idea that will be explored more in future lessons.",

You only need to keep track of the closest birthday you've heard so far, however.\n* Problem 5 is easy to solve as soon as you've solved problems 3 and 4.\n* Problem 6 - 10 require you to have written down everyone's birthday, likely in order.\n* Problems 7 - 9 are the same problem but for different numbers of people.

Here's some helpful tips.\r\n\r\n* Insist that students check for the pair raffle silently. For this one it's very easy to just yell out what number you would pair with and lose the opporuntity to see how many total checks are necessary if they can just all yell from their seats.\r\n* The group raffle doesn't necessarily need to be silent. As students will see, it's an incredibly difficult problem and they're going to need to do a lot of checking even if they're able to talk out loud.\r\n* Think ahead about whether you actually want to award winners of the raffles. It's pretty unlikely that there will be a winner. \r\n* There's a pretty good chance that no one will win either raffle.\r\n"

Often times a parallel solution will be the fastest option, but there is a limit. \r\n\r\nSolutions that use parallel computing can scale more effectively than solutions that use sequential computing.

In particular, students may not receive a grade based on performance on topic questions nor can they be used for teacher evaluation. Beyond these requirements, however, they are primarily intended to formatively assess student progress and learning as they prepare for the end of course exam.\r\n\r\nWithin our own course we recommend that you use them in a variety of ways:\r\n\r\n* Throughout the unit assign topic questions to students related to the topics students are learning about that day or that week\r\n* Prior to the unit assessment assign topic questions to help students practice and prepare for the summative assessment\r\n* After the unit assessment use these topic questions to help students track their progress towards preparation for the AP assessment\r\n\r\n![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/topics6.png)\r\n\r\nClick for more info: [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dqYF5u0AULjw049gaCwAP34ZSe0VuEWbAjWoH1-YMW0/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n"
