For example, what is the relationship between `Instrument` and `Guitar`?*\n* <i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> *Why were your `play()` methods different than others even though the method name was the same?*\n* *What did the `Instrument` do when their `play()` method was called? Why?*\n* *If we wanted to store all of you into a list, or an array, what would be the type for the array?*\n* *If we created a list of `Instrument`s, how would we be able to call your `play()` methods?*\n\n**Discussion Goal:** Students notice that each role had specific versions of `play()`. When their role was called, they used their version of `play()` to instruct their actions. Students realize that `Instrument` has a generic version of `play()` and relate this generic version of `play()` to the `Instrument` representing a generic version of the other represented instruments. Since `Instrument` was a generic version of the other roles, it could represent the superclass, while the other roles could represent subclasses of `Instrument`. By the end of this discussion, students should start referring to polymorphic behavior and realize that since they are all types of `Instrument`s, then a program should call their version of `play()` when traversing the array.\n\n**Do This:** Define polymorphism and talk through the code example:\n* Polymorphism means performing an action in different ways. The `Instrument`s in the Polymorphism Role Play was an example of polymorphism.\n* In this example, `Animal` is the superclass, and `Dog` and `Cat` are the subclasses.\n* `Dog` is-a `Animal` and `Cat` is-a `Animal`, but `Animal` is NOT a `Dog` or `Cat`.\n* Each class has its own version of `speak()`.\n* When `speak()` is called on a `Cat` object, Java searches for and uses its version of `speak()` instead of the superclass version.\n* Since `Dog` is-a `Animal`, the `puppy` reference variable can be created of type `Animal` and store a `Dog` object in this variable. When `speak()` is called on this object, Java searches for and uses the `Dog`'s version of `speak()` since it is a `Dog` object.\n* To keep track of all of the `Animal`s in one list, create an array of type `Animal` to store `Dog` and `Cat` objects since `Dog` is-a `Animal` and `Cat` is-a `Animal`.\n* Alternatively, the `Dog` and `Cat` objects can be created first, then add their references to the `Animal` array."
