Bring the class back together and review:\n* The header of a `for` loop has three parts: initialization of the loop control variable, the loop’s condition, and either an increment or decrement. A semicolon separates each part.\n* A loop control variable is a special type of variable used to count the number of times a loop executes. In a `for` loop, the loop control variable is declared in the header. The loop control variable changes each time through the loop based on the increment or decrement specified in the header.\n* A `for` loop can access elements of an array in order, known as traversing an array, by using the loop control variable as an index value that changes each time through the loop."

Lessons 11, 12, and 13 collectively include instructions for the three-day project.\n\nIf there is not enough time for the three-day project, a one-day option is available that achieves the targeted learning objectives and goals. If using this option, refer to the [**Concert in the Theater Project 1 Day Lesson Plan**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tZEF_Gg9Yq9sKKqMzx1m1HqU2yxUBCrkZ_TqLXVEO40/edit), which includes a one-day version of the [**Concert in the Theater Project Planning Guide**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17ftt69lzdL_j0XYd1Sf175iHiD80vAnQLSoB7X6C9-M/edit#). Direct students to develop their program on Code Studio in Lesson 13 so they can submit their project. While the one-day option covers the learning objectives and goals, it shortens planning and reflection time. Consider this tradeoff when deciding which version to use."
