        "description": "**General Support:** As a teacher your role is primarily to support students as they make their way through the tutorial. Here are a few tips that should help students regardless of the level they're working on\n\n* **Checking Correctness:** This tutorial will not tell students whether they completed the level correctly. Encourage students to use the target images and directions provided in every level to know if they are on the right track. If students want to move on past a particularly tricky level they can simply click \"Finish\" and continue on.\n* **Collaborate with Neighbors:** Encourage students to check in with a neighbor when they're getting stuck. Since this tutorial includes videos and students may be wearing headphones it can get easy to \"go into a bubble\". Help break those barriers by actively pairing students if they seem like they need help.\n* **Read the Instructions:** The instructions usually provide helpful tips on how to complete the level. Before completing a level for a student ensure they've actually looked closely at the target image and read all the text there.\n* **Stuck? Click here:** Each level includes a GIF showing exactly how to complete the level. If students want help they can and should use these GIFs. If they only want to use them as a hint, just have them close the GIF once they've seen the first part.\n* **Move On and Come Back:** Sometimes students will benefit more from coming back to a tricky level. Except for the \"Design Mode\" sequence, all levels are independent of one another, though they do rely to some degree on previously introduced concepts.",

That said, there's a couple tips that can help\n\n* **When to use Double Quotes:** The `setProperty()` block automatically changes the final dropdown when you select what properties you want to change, including whether they use double quotes. When in doubt, students should first change the first two dropdowns, then use the last one as a model for what values work there. The most common error is failing to use double quotes around a color name.\n* **Hover to Read IDs:** By hovering over an element in your app you can read its ID.

This is never the intended behavior for this tutorial. Even though this is mentioned in the videos, a quick reminder might help get kids unstuck.\n* **Check Your IDs:** You need to change the `\"id\"` property in `onEvent()` so that it detects events with the correct element.\n* **You Can Use Multiple Blocks in an `onEvent()`:** If you want multiple things to happen when you click the same button, just add more blocks to the same `onEvent()`. You should never have a program that has two `onEvent()` blocks for the combination of element (e.g. \"button1\") and event type (e.g. \"click\").",

More frivolous wearables or digital art installations may be more concerned with personal expression than solving a specific problem.\n* **What Is Innovative About It?:** Encourage students to refer back to the earlier discussion about innovation for this. It can also be useful to compare against other devices found during the research phase.\n* **How Do You Interact With It?:** Ask students to think back to the _Input, Output, Storage, Processing_ model that was introduced way back in Unit 1. The goal here is to identify specifically the Inputs and Outputs provided by a given device - the more specific these are, the more easily students will be able to connect elements of the Circuit Playground to these devices.\n* **What is the Impact?:** Encourage students to think of the people who are affected by this innovation. Most innovations were probably designed to improve someone's life, and students can write about the impact this could have on individuals. But some devices may have unexpected or unintended consequences, and students can reflect on how those consequences could affect individuals.",

Consider having students think of their own prediction and discuss with a partner before typing in their response. Once they're run the code, bring the class together for a full-group discussion to discuss how their predictions were similar or different from the resulting program. Use this as an opportunity to address any misconceptions that students may have had about the code initially.\n\n**Caution: Predict Entries Can't Be Deleted!** Once you enter an answer into the predict box, you are not able to reset it. This can make it difficult to repeat this process with multiple classes. Instead, we recommend entering dummy text like \"Class discussion\" and running the code. This way, the answer isn't \"spoiled\" for future classes. However, this means you will need to keep track of predictions separately such as on a whiteboard or in a document.\n\n**Digging Deeper:** For more tips about programming levels, see the [CSD Guide to Programming Levels](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WGywQ25khB6-FB20x6wO9dGVO9_qJlWkuLVLREJS4Jo/preview).

These are intended as helpful student resources, not class readings. They are a good place to go for review after learning content or when students get stuck in levels.

Students may also ask about the small pads on the outer ring of the circuit playground, or they may notice the eye / ear / temperature icons on the circuit playground for the different sensors.

Student responses may vary but may include the following strategies:\n* Scan each row from left to right followed by scanning each column from top to bottom.\n* Check surrounding letters. Once you found the first letter or a key letter in a word you’re searching for, check the letters around it to see if you should keep going. For example, if you have a word with Q in it, if there’s no U next to it, then you need to keep searching.\n* Look for words that have less-common letters in them such as words with a Q, X, J, or Z\n* Look for words with letter pairs, such as double letters or QU\n* Look for more than one word at a time.\n* Turn the puzzle upside down\n"

Rather than asking students to choose a different project, consider asking students to imagine a more scaled-down version of their initial idea. As an analogy, if students initial idea is the \"Run\" step, imagine a less intense version that represents what the \"Walk\" step would look like. If necessary, you can keep going back further to a \"Crawl\" step as well. \n\n**Digging Deeper:** This is sometimes referred to as the Minimal Viable Product - you can learn more about this process and adapt it into your project strategies by reading this article: [Making Sense of MVP](https://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp) by Henrik Kniberg"

This helps students prepare and communicate their issue before asking for help.\n- If students haven't seen it yet, consider showing the [Debugging Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auv10y-dN4s) to the class to reinforce debugging best practices."

        "description": "**Debugging Strategies:** As students design and implement their own project ideas, they may find themselves with new bugs that they need to untangle and you may find yourself looking at completely unfamiliar code as students look for help troubleshooting their errors. To help smooth out the debugging experience, consider the following strategies:\n\n- Review the [Teacher Guide to Debugging](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-mXz53CAQ1dy3-RVGkoUnR0hfAwdWeza4kch6NAvLb8/edit) for some common questions and strategies to help support students in debugging their code\n- Have students follow the steps in the [Student Guide to Debugging](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wNwoKDyoUas5GGkhqGmNN1u0XGQEdeOMWhSziyYIf8o/edit#) and use the [Bug Report Quarter-Sheets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M6mnq73DfyvzasucVAwfL-gjl2JqVPzjy_fRx5j4j7c/preview) as an initial step in the debugging process. This helps students prepare and communicate their issue before asking for help.\n- If students haven't seen it yet, consider showing the [Debugging Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auv10y-dN4s) to the class to reinforce debugging best practices.\n\n**Digging Deeper:** Consider supplying students with an object to talk to as part of the debugging process. This is sometimes known as Rubber Duck Debugging - you can learn more on the website https://rubberduckdebugging.com/"

This helps students prepare and communicate their issue before asking for help.\n- If students haven't seen it yet, consider showing the [Debugging Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auv10y-dN4s) to the class to reinforce debugging best practices.\n\n**Digging Deeper:** Consider supplying students with an object to talk to as part of the debugging process.

This helps students prepare and communicate their issue before asking for help.\n- If students haven't seen it yet, consider showing the [Debugging Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auv10y-dN4s) to the class to reinforce debugging best practices.\n\n**Digging Deeper:** Consider supplying students with an object to talk to as part of the debugging process.

To holistically assess the learning objectives of the unit, the post-project test should be paired with the end-of-unit project which is the primary student assessment in each unit.\n\n**Unlocking The Tests:** This test is locked and hidden from student view by default.
