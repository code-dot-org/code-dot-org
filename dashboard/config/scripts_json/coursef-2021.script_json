Why can you not just use a loop?\n\nOn the white board or overhead, rewrite the program without the repeated code, but leaving one line space. In that/those line space(s), call a **function**.

While discussing, show screenshots or examples of apps on your smartphone or tablet if possible.\n\n**Say**: Ensure that all students are on the same page regarding this topic by introducing some key terms and concepts. \n\n- *In this course we have been learning how to code. Code is used to create computer applications. Games, web browsers, media players... the list of applications goes on and on!*  \n- **_App_** *is short for application. Usually, apps more specifically refer to applications running on small computers called* _**mobile devices**._\n- *Smartphones and tablets are examples of mobile devices.*\n\n**Discuss**: Apps are everywhere! Ask students why they think apps have become so popular. Here are some example explanations:\n\n- Many people can more easily access or afford a mobile device (e.g., smartphone) than a larger computer with a keyboard, mouse, and so forth. \n- Apps can address a variety of needs. For example, if I need a ride somewhere, I might try a ride sharing app and get there quickly. If I want to know what movies I should watch, there's probably an app that can help me decide. And of course, if I want to call or text someone on my phone, I use apps for those as well! \n\n**Say**: Introduce accessibility with the remarks below.\n\n- *As apps become used by more and more people, app developers often come across issues that they had not considered, likely because they have never experienced those issues in their own lives.*\n- *Many of these issues are related to _**accessibility**._ In the world of computer science, accessibility is about creating technology for people with _**disabilities**._* \n- *Disabilities include physical, auditory, visual, and many others.*\n- *Disabilities are diverse and impact people in different ways. For example, someone who is slightly visually impaired might simply wear glasses. Someone who is severely visually impaired might be considered \"blind\" and will need more assistance.* \n\n**Transition**: Tell students you'd like to introduce them to a few kids who, even though they have disabilities, are just like them."

While displaying a scenario image, read its accompanying script to the class (see below). Discussion questions are included in relevant slides.\n\n[slides]\n\n#### Designing for Accessibility Scenarios\n\n*Slide 1: Meet Wei*\n\n* Wei is a talented kid who LOVES music. She plays piano and sings very well! \n* Wei is visually impaired. While she is not completely blind, it is very difficult for her to see things, even if they are near to her eyes.\n* Wei has had to learn piano differently from kids who aren’t visually impaired, but that hasn’t stopped her from becoming a great musician! \n* Wei recently began creating her own music. She is very proud of it! She would like to record and share her music with her friends.\n\n*Slide 2: Introducing Grammaphone!*\n\n* Grammaphone is a popular new app that allows people to upload and share their own music with friends. \n* Here is a screenshot of the home screen. What do you think about it? How do you think this app works? \n\n*Slide 3: Wei’s Problem*\n\n* Wei needs to use Grammaphone to share her music. After all, it’s the most popular music sharing app!\n* However, she’s having a difficult time using the app. Why do you think that is? \n\n*Slide 4: Meet Roger*\n\n* Roger is an energetic kid who loves video games! He especially likes playing sports games with his friends.\n* Things have been hard for Roger lately, though. Due to an accident a few years ago, Roger’s hand had to be “amputated” (surgically removed). \n* Thankfully, computer scientists, engineers, and doctors are working hard to provide Roger with a cool-looking robotic “prosthetic hand”, which will be awesome!\n* But for now, Roger wants to play sports video games with his friends! \n\n*Slide 5: Introducing Football Frenzy!*\n\n* Football Frenzy is a new mobile game that everyone loves!\n* It has cool graphics, awesome sound effects, tight controls, and amazing action!\n* Here’s a screenshot of the game in action. Based on the interface, how do you think this game is played? \n\n*Slide 6: Roger’s Problem*\n\n* All of Roger’s friends play Football Frenzy. It’s connected online so you can play it anywhere!\n* Roger wants to play Football Frenzy with them, but he is having a difficult time. Why do you think that is?\n\n*Slide 7: I Wish...* \n\n* Neither of these apps were designed with people like Wei and Roger in mind.\n* When it comes to these apps, what specific features do you think Wei and Roger wish for? \n* Let’s make their wishes come true by redesigning these apps! \n\n[/slides]"

Students can design as many screens for the app as they wish, and they do not need to make their app look anything like the original examples.\n\nIf there is time, students may redesign apps for both characters.\n\n**Distribute**: Pass out crayons/pencils/etc. to each student as they open their **Thinkspot Journals**. \n\n**Share**: After designing, students share their app design with a neighbor, or if there is time, some students can share with the whole class. Each student should answer how their app design addresses the need of the user in question."

Maybe the everyone in the whole school? Goodness, that's going to take a while! Pose the question to your students:\n\n*\"How could I do this more quickly?\"*\n\nYour students will likely pick up on the fact that only one word is changing, and that word is simply a person's name. Help them see the location by circling Jenny's name on the board and writing \"firstName\" next to it.\n\n*\"It would take a long time to write a poem for everyone in the school if I couldn't start until I knew who I was writing it about, wouldn't it?\"*\n\n- *How long do you think it would take to make a video game if they couldn't start until they knew your username?*\n- *How expensive would video games be if they had to be created separately for each person?*\n- *How do you think we can get around that?*\n\nBy this time, it's quite likely that your class will come up with the idea of having a placeholder.

We wouldn't want to call it \"age\" if it was a placeholder for their name, right?*\n\nNow, let's add some more volunteers. Give them each a piece of paper to write their name on, and have them tuck it inside individual envelopes labeled firstName.\n\nThis time, put the poem on the board with a blank space labeled \"firstName\" where the student's name will go. \n\n- Have the first student in line (likely the last student from the previous example) pull their name from the envelope and that's what you'll write in the space.\n- When you erase the board, only erase the portion with the last student's name in it. \n- Call the next student to show their variable. \n- Repeat as many times as is entertaining\n\nNow it's time for the main activity."

Students will identify various values for the variables found in food chains (Example: plants, animals, decomposer, etc.) as they document these values on notecards and show the movement of matter through an environment. Students will also learn about the 10% Rule and further describe energy flow with a writing prompt.\n\n*Standards Addressed:*\n\n - **CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.W.5.2.B:** Develop the topic with facts, definitions, concrete details, quotations, or other information and examples related to the topic.\n- **CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.5.NF.B.7.C:** Solve real world problems involving division of unit fractions by non-zero whole numbers and division of whole numbers by unit fractions, e.g., by using visual fraction models and equations to represent the problem. \n\n - **NGSS.5-LS2-1:** Develop a model to describe the movement of matter among plants, animals, decomposers, and the environment. \n\n"

Students will run the simulation at least 5 times, recording the number of apples collected by each animal and the total time it took to run the simulation.\n\n**Step 2 Line Graph**: Using the data collected in the previous step, students will plot a double line graph. Encourage students to share their graphs with neighbors and discuss the following questions:\n\n* Are the graphs the same or different? Why do you think that is?\n* Do you see any patterns?\n* What do you think you'd see if you ran this simulation 5 more times?\n\n**Step 3 Modify and Predict**: In the second bubble students will be able to modify some of the variables that control this simulation. Each student will choose a variable to modify, predict how that change will impact the simulation. Potential variables to modify include:\n\n* Number of elephants\n* Number of hippos\n* Number of apples\n* Speed of elephants\n* Speed of hippos\n\n**Step 4 Collecting More Data**: With the modifications students decided on in the last step, they'll run the simulation five more times and collect the data.\n\n**Step 5 Visualize Your Data**: This step is purposefully left open to allow students to explore any visual representation of their data that they'd like. The goal of this visual should be to prove or disprove their prediction.\n\n\n\n**Share**: After finishing, students can share their results with a neighbor.

Here are a few tips that should help students regardless of the level they're working on\n\n* **Collaborate with Neighbors:** Encourage students to check in with a neighbor to discuss what they are experiencing. Since this tutorial includes videos and students may be wearing headphones it can get easy to \"go into a bubble\". Help break those barriers by actively pairing students.\n* **Read the Instructions:** The instructions usually provide helpful information about what is happening behind the scenes. \n* **Go back and try different things:** If students finish quickly, encourage them to go back to \"Train More\". In the last part of the activity, students can also go back and choose a \"New Word\". More training data tends to make the machine learning model more accurate and consistent. Students can also learn by purposefully training their model incorrectly, or not training it at all.\n\n###Level 1 - [Machine Learning](https://studio.code.org/s/oceans/stage/1/puzzle/1)\n\n###[AI- Machine Learning Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeU5m6vRyCk)",

What do you suppose the process would be like for me to send a message to request that page?_\n\t- _What do I do as a user?_\n\t- _What do you think happens inside the **internet**?_\n\nSending a message over the internet is a lot like sending a message through the mail...if every letter we sent required thousands of envelopes!\n\nEvery message we send through the internet gets chopped up and each piece is wrapped in its own version of an envelope. We call those **packets**. **Packets** are specially formed chunks of information that are able to easily flow through any of the internet's channels.\n\nSometimes, a few of those packets will get lost, because the internet is a crazy place. In that case, the packets need to be resent, and the whole message has to get put on hold until they arrive.\n\n_Where do you think those **packets** are headed?_\n\n- Even if you're sending messages to another person, they first have to go to at least one **server**.\n\t- A **server** is a special computer that is supposed to be always on and ready to send and receive information.\n\t- Every website has a **server**.\n\t- Even email goes through **servers**.\n\n**Servers** don't have names like you and I do. They're actually addressed using numbers. These numbers are called **IP addresses**, and they look a little strange.\n\n- For example: One of Code.org's **IP addresses** used to be 54.243.71.82\n\t- (Please be sure to check this out in advance. Most IP addresses change from time to time and they are then reused for other sites.)\n\nThere are many ways to reach the internet from your house, school, or place of business.\n\n- You can connect directly using a cable (that might be **DSL, Cable, or Fiber Optic**)\n- Or you can connect using radio waves over the air through **Wi-Fi**.\n\nDirect connections are most reliable, but they can be inconvenient.\n\n- *Can you figure out why?*\n\t- (You have to be attached to a cable!)\n\nWi-Fi connections are super convenient, but the aren't always reliable.\n\n- *Can you figure out why not?*\n\t- (Radio waves bounce all over the place and can get lost.)"

That's what the **DNS** is for. The **DNS** (Domain Name Server) has tables that allow the system to go back and forth between URLs and IP addresses. If the Domain Name Servers ever stopped working, it would shut down the internet as we know it!\n\nWith that said, let's try to understand what the **DNS** does by making a little **DNS** table ourselves.\n\nPull out a piece of paper and draw a grid similar to that in the internet activity:\n\nSample of **DNS** Table:\n\n| #  | URL  | IP Address |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\n| 1  | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;code.org&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  | &nbsp;&nbsp;54.243.71.82&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n| 2  |   |   |\n| 3  |   |   |\n| 4  |   |   |\n| 5  |   |   |\n\n\n<br/>First, we need to fill in this table.\n\n- Survey the class for their favorite websites and write the **URLs** in the left column\n- Use a site like ***get-site-ip.com** to find the IP addresses for those sites and write them in the corresponding rows of the right column.\n\nNow let's take this **DNS** Table and pretend to send messages through the internet!"

Wi-Fi doesn’t require cables, but since the signal bounces all over the place, packets can get lost pretty easily.\n\t- Simulation: Internet must carry each packet on their shoulder (no hands).\n- Cable/DSL: Fairly good at delivering messages, but you must be connected to a wire.\n\t- Simulation: Internet must carry each packet on the back of one hand and must keep the other hand touching a wall, desk, chair or the floor at all times.\n-  Fiber Optic Cable: The best at delivering messages, but you must be connected to a wire.\n\t- Simulation: Internet can carry packets in hand, but must keep the other hand touching a wall, desk, chair or the floor at all times."
