To see more, check out the [Digital Passport Educator Guide](https://d1e2bohyu2u2w9.cloudfront.net/education/sites/default/files/tlr-asset/document-bundled-educator-guide-92018.pdf).\n\n**Project** [Slide 4](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LC3dpRP6mXBZkB8oe3hGMWkJUhunO9e5gU6g8WlUQsk/edit#slide=id.g3da8846a99_1_0) and ask students: *Imagine when you walked in, I said to you* [in a friendly tone, with a big smile] *\"Hello!\" Which emoji would fit?*\n\nHave students show their answer by holding up fingers (1, 2, 3, or 4). If anyone holds up a number other than 1, ask them to share out why.\n\n**Repeat** this two more times, saying *Hello* differently each time: once with an angry tone and a scowl, and once with a nervous or scared tone.\n\n**Project** [Slide 5](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LC3dpRP6mXBZkB8oe3hGMWkJUhunO9e5gU6g8WlUQsk/edit#slide=id.g3da8846a99_2_13) and ask: *What about if you're just reading it? How does it make you feel now?*\n\nPoint out how when something is just in text, it can be even more difficult to interpret what someone means. Explain that their responses might be different depending on who they are because we all interpret the world a little differently. Clarify that interpret means *to understand something based on our point of view.* ([Slide 6](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LC3dpRP6mXBZkB8oe3hGMWkJUhunO9e5gU6g8WlUQsk/edit#slide=id.g3d844aea9e_1_4))\n\n**Say**: *Because words can be interpreted differently by different people, it's important to think about the words we use and how they affect people. We might say something just to be funny, but someone might take it seriously, and it might hurt their feelings. This can happen in person, and it can also happen online. It may even happen more online, because the words are just text -- we're not actually face-to-face with other people.*"

Students will run the simulation at least 5 times, recording the number of apples collected by each animal and the total time it took to run the simulation.\n\n**Step 2 Line Graph**: Using the data collected in the previous step, students will plot a double line graph.

Why do you think that is?\n* Do you see any patterns?\n* What do you think you'd see if you ran this simulation 5 more times?\n\n**Step 3 Modify and Predict**: In the second bubble students will be able to modify some of the variables that control this simulation. Each student will choose a variable to modify, predict how that change will impact the simulation. Potential variables to modify include:\n\n* Number of elephants\n* Number of hippos\n* Number of apples\n* Speed of elephants\n* Speed of hippos\n\n*Note that students can change the sprites in their simulation to other animals and food if they wish.*\n\n**Step 4 Collecting More Data**: With the modifications students decided on in the last step, they'll run the simulation five more times and collect the data.\n\n**Step 5 Visualize Your Data**: This step is purposefully left open to allow students to explore any visual representation of their data that they'd like. The goal of this visual should be to prove or disprove their prediction.\n\n\n\n**Share**: After finishing, students can share their results with a neighbor. When the whole class is ready, bring everyone together."

Help break those barriers by actively pairing students.\n* **Read the Instructions:** The instructions usually provide helpful information about what is happening behind the scenes. \n* **Go back and try different things:** If students finish quickly, encourage them to go back to \"Train More\". In the last part of the activity, students can also go back and choose a \"New Word\". More training data tends to make the machine learning model more accurate and consistent.

What do you suppose the process would be like for me to send a message to request that page?_\n\t- _What do I do as a user?_\n\t- _What do you think happens inside the internet?_\n\nSending a message over the internet is a lot like sending a message through the mail...if every letter we sent required thousands of envelopes!\n\nEvery message we send through the internet gets chopped up and each piece is wrapped in its own version of an envelope. We call those packets. Packets are specially formed chunks of information that are able to easily flow through any of the internet's channels.\n\nSometimes, a few of those packets will get lost, because the internet is a crazy place. In that case, the packets need to be resent, and the whole message has to get put on hold until they arrive.\n\n_Where do you think those packets are headed?_\n\n- Even if you're sending messages to another person, they first have to go to at least one server.\n\t- A server is a special computer that is supposed to be always on and ready to send and receive information.\n\t- Every website has a server.\n\t- Even email goes through servers.\n\nServers don't have names like you and I do. They're actually addressed using numbers. These numbers are called IP addresses, and they look a little strange.\n\n- For example: One of Code.org's IP addresses used to be 54.243.71.82\n\t- (Please be sure to check this out in advance. Most IP addresses change from time to time and they are then reused for other sites.)\n\nThere are many ways to reach the internet from your house, school, or place of business.\n\n- You can connect directly using a cable (that might be DSL, Cable, or Fiber Optic)\n- Or you can connect using radio waves over the air through Wi-Fi.\n\nDirect connections are most reliable, but they can be inconvenient.\n\n- *Can you figure out why?*\n\t- (You have to be attached to a cable!)\n\nWi-Fi connections are super convenient, but the aren't always reliable.\n\n- *Can you figure out why not?*\n\t- (Radio waves bounce all over the place and can get lost.)"

That's what the DNS is for. The DNS (Domain Name Server) has tables that allow the system to go back and forth between URLs and IP addresses. If the Domain Name Servers ever stopped working, it would shut down the internet as we know it!\n\nWith that said, let's try to understand what the DNS does by making a little DNS table ourselves.\n\nPull out a piece of paper and draw a grid similar to that in the internet activity:\n\nSample of DNS Table:\n\n| #  | URL  | IP Address |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\n| 1  | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;code.org&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  | &nbsp;&nbsp;54.243.71.82&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n| 2  |   |   |\n| 3  |   |   |\n| 4  |   |   |\n| 5  |   |   |\n\n\n<br/>First, we need to fill in this table.\n\n- Survey the class for their favorite websites and write the URLs in the left column\n- Use a site like ***get-site-ip.com** to find the IP addresses for those sites and write them in the corresponding rows of the right column.\n\nNow let's take this DNS Table and pretend to send messages through the internet!"

Wi-Fi doesn’t require cables, but since the signal bounces all over the place, packets can get lost pretty easily.\n\t- Simulation: Internet must carry each packet on their shoulder (no hands).\n- Cable/DSL: Fairly good at delivering messages, but you must be connected to a wire.\n\t- Simulation: Internet must carry each packet on the back of one hand and must keep the other hand touching a wall, desk, chair or the floor at all times.\n-  Fiber Optic Cable: The best at delivering messages, but you must be connected to a wire.\n\t- Simulation: Internet can carry packets in hand, but must keep the other hand touching a wall, desk, chair or the floor at all times."

Code is used to create computer applications. Games, web browsers, media players... the list of applications goes on and on!*  \n- _App_ *is short for application. Usually, apps more specifically refer to applications running on small computers called* _mobile devices._\n- *Smartphones and tablets are examples of mobile devices.*\n\n**Discuss**: Apps are everywhere! Ask students why they think apps have become so popular. Here are some example explanations:\n\n- Many people can more easily access or afford a mobile device (e.g., smartphone) than a larger computer with a keyboard, mouse, and so forth. \n- Apps can address a variety of needs. For example, if I need a ride somewhere, I might try a ride sharing app and get there quickly. If I want to know what movies I should watch, there's probably an app that can help me decide. And of course, if I want to call or text someone on my phone, I use apps for those as well! \n\nIntroduce accessibility with the remarks below.\n\n**Say**: \n\n- *As apps become used by more and more people, app developers often come across issues that they had not considered, likely because they have never experienced those issues in their own lives.*\n- *Many of these issues are related to _accessibility._ In the world of computer science, accessibility is about creating technology for people with _disabilities._* \n- *Disabilities include physical, auditory, visual, and many others.*\n- *Disabilities are diverse and impact people in different ways. For example, someone who is slightly visually impaired might simply wear glasses. Someone who is severely visually impaired might be considered \"blind\" and will need more assistance.* \n\n**Transition**: Tell students you'd like to introduce them to a few kids who, even though they have disabilities, are just like them."

While displaying a scenario image, read its accompanying script to the class (see below). Discussion questions are included in relevant slides.\n\n[slides]\n\n#### Designing for Accessibility Scenarios\n\n*Slide 1: Meet Wei*\n\n* Wei is a talented kid who LOVES music. She plays piano and sings very well! \n* Wei is visually impaired. While she is not completely blind, it is very difficult for her to see things, even if they are near to her eyes.\n* Wei has had to learn piano differently from kids who aren’t visually impaired, but that hasn’t stopped her from becoming a great musician! \n* Wei recently began creating her own music. She is very proud of it! She would like to record and share her music with her friends.\n\n*Slide 2: Introducing Grammaphone!*\n\n* Grammaphone is a popular new app that allows people to upload and share their own music with friends. \n* Here is a screenshot of the home screen. What do you think about it? How do you think this app works? \n\n*Slide 3: Wei’s Problem*\n\n* Wei needs to use Grammaphone to share her music. After all, it’s the most popular music sharing app!\n* However, she’s having a difficult time using the app. Why do you think that is? \n\n*Slide 4: Meet Roger*\n\n* Roger is an energetic kid who loves video games! He especially likes playing sports games with his friends.\n* Things have been hard for Roger lately, though. Due to an accident a few years ago, Roger’s hand had to be “amputated” (surgically removed). \n* Thankfully, computer scientists, engineers, and doctors are working hard to provide Roger with a cool-looking robotic “prosthetic hand”, which will be awesome!\n* But for now, Roger wants to play sports video games with his friends! \n\n*Slide 5: Introducing Football Frenzy!*\n\n* Football Frenzy is a new mobile game that everyone loves!\n* It has cool graphics, awesome sound effects, tight controls, and amazing action!\n* Here’s a screenshot of the game in action. Based on the interface, how do you think this game is played? \n\n*Slide 6: Roger’s Problem*\n\n* All of Roger’s friends play Football Frenzy. It’s connected online so you can play it anywhere!\n* Roger wants to play Football Frenzy with them, but he is having a difficult time. Why do you think that is?\n\n*Slide 7: I Wish...* \n\n* Neither of these apps were designed with people like Wei and Roger in mind.\n* When it comes to these apps, what specific features do you think Wei and Roger wish for? \n* Let’s make their wishes come true by redesigning these apps! \n\n[/slides]"

        "description": "####App Redesign Activity (25 min)\n\nThe final scenario allows students to sketch a redesign of one app from the scenarios (\"Grammaphone\" for Wei or \"Football Frenzy\" for Roger). \n\nStudents should primarily focus their efforts on making their redesigned app more accessible for either of them, along with any other accessibility features they can think of. Students can design as many screens for the app as they wish, and they do not need to make their app look anything like the original examples.\n\nIf there is time, students may redesign apps for both characters.\n\n**Distribute**: Pass out crayons/pencils/etc. to each student as they open their reflection journals. \n\n**Share**: After designing, students share their app design with a neighbor, or if there is time, some students can share with the whole class. Each student should answer how their app design addresses the need of the user in question."

Students should be clear about the various expectations over the coming weeks so that they can prepare for their review and presentations appropriately.  \n\nTo help your class manage this multi-stage undertaking, they should be given both the ***Final Project Design Worksheet** and the ***Final Project Rubric** on the first day of planning. Students will then be able to follow the rubric each step of the way to predict what their project grade will be in the end.  \n\nThe Final Project Design Worksheet will provide a place for students to capture relevant thoughts and processes as they go, so they are more prepared for their reviews and presentations in the end.  \n\nAs the teacher, you should download a copy of the documents and decide which elements are important to you.
