We might say something just to be funny, but someone might take it seriously, and it might hurt their feelings. This can happen in person, and it can also happen online.

To involve more students and have them act out this model, assign roles:\n\n_Computers:_ Pass out and collect envelopes.

This can be done in many ways, but here are a few:\n- **Public Demo:**  Select a few exemplary volunteers to briefly demo their projects in front of the class. As they do so, have them touch on what the planning-to-coding experience was like for them, including ideas they'd still like to implement.\n- **Pair Playtesting:**  Have students or groups pair up and playtest each other's projects. As they do, ask them to provide positive and constructive feedback to each other. The benefit here is that students will have the opportunity to provide and respond to feedback in a smaller setting.\n- **Gallery Walk:**  Ensure all students have their projects ready for testing. Have students move \"musical chairs\"-style to another computer and play/test the project there for a few minutes, until they receive a signal from you to move to another computer. Repeat this every few minutes. While there is less opportunity for structured communication here, this ensures students get to demo as many of their peers' projects as possible.\n",

Students will run the simulation at least 5 times, recording the number of apples collected by each animal and the total time it took to run the simulation.\n\n**Step 2 Line Graph**: Using the data collected in the previous step, students will plot a double line graph. Encourage students to share their graphs with neighbors and discuss the following questions:\n\n* Are the graphs the same or different? Why do you think that is?\n* Do you see any patterns?\n* What do you think you'd see if you ran this simulation 5 more times?\n\n**Step 3 Modify and Predict**: In the second bubble students will be able to modify some of the variables that control this simulation. Each student will choose a variable to modify, predict how that change will impact the simulation. Potential variables to modify include:\n\n* Number of elephants\n* Number of hippos\n* Number of apples\n* Speed of elephants\n* Speed of hippos\n\n*Note that students can change the sprites in their simulation to other animals and food if they wish.*\n\n**Step 4 Collecting More Data**: With the modifications students decided on in the last step, they'll run the simulation five more times and collect the data.\n\n**Step 5 Visualize Your Data**: This step is purposefully left open to allow students to explore any visual representation of their data that they'd like. The goal of this visual should be to prove or disprove their prediction.\n\n\n\n**Share**: After finishing, students can share their results with a neighbor.

Here are a few tips that should help students regardless of the level they're working on.\n\n* **Collaborate with Neighbors:** Encourage students to check in with a neighbor to discuss what they are experiencing. Since this tutorial includes videos and students may be wearing headphones it can get easy to \"go into a bubble\". Help break those barriers by actively pairing students.\n* **Read the Instructions:** The instructions usually provide helpful information about what is happening behind the scenes. \n* **Go back and try different things:** If students finish quickly, encourage them to go back to \"Train More\". In the last part of the activity, students can also go back and choose a \"New Word\". More training data tends to make the machine learning model more accurate and consistent. Students can also learn by purposefully training their model incorrectly, or not training it at all.\n",

        "description": "\n####Getting the Message\n\n- It's quite likely that your students are aware of what the internet is, but they may not really understand what the internet does.\n\t- **Ask:** _What is the internet?_\n\t- _Is the internet a public place or a private place?_\n\t- (Truthfully, many people think it can be both, but it should be viewed as a public space no matter what settings you think you've mastered.)\n\t- _How does information get from place to place?_\n- _Let's say that I want to look at the webpage for Code.org. What do you suppose the process would be like for me to send a message to request that page?_\n\t- _What do I do as a user?_\n\t- _What do you think happens inside the internet?_\n\nSending a message over the internet is a lot like sending a message through the mail...if every letter we sent required thousands of envelopes!\n\nEvery message we send through the internet gets chopped up and each piece is wrapped in its own version of an envelope. We call those packets. Packets are specially formed chunks of information that are able to easily flow through any of the internet's channels.\n\nSometimes, a few of those packets will get lost, because the internet is a crazy place. In that case, the packets need to be resent, and the whole message has to get put on hold until they arrive.\n\n_Where do you think those packets are headed?_\n\n- Even if you're sending messages to another person, they first have to go to at least one server.\n\t- A server is a special computer that is supposed to be always on and ready to send and receive information.\n\t- Every website has a server.\n\t- Even email goes through servers.\n\nServers don't have names like you and I do. They're actually addressed using numbers. These numbers are called IP addresses, and they look a little strange.\n\n- For example: One of Code.org's IP addresses used to be 54.243.71.82\n\t- (Please be sure to check this out in advance. Most IP addresses change from time to time and they are then reused for other sites.)\n\nThere are many ways to reach the internet from your house, school, or place of business.\n\n- You can connect directly using a cable (that might be DSL, Cable, or Fiber Optic)\n- Or you can connect using radio waves over the air through Wi-Fi.\n\nDirect connections are most reliable, but they can be inconvenient.\n\n- *Can you figure out why?*\n\t- (You have to be attached to a cable!)\n\nWi-Fi connections are super convenient, but the aren't always reliable.\n\n- *Can you figure out why not?*\n\t- (Radio waves bounce all over the place and can get lost.)"

That's what the DNS is for. The DNS (Domain Name Server) has tables that allow the system to go back and forth between URLs and IP addresses. If the Domain Name Servers ever stopped working, it would shut down the internet as we know it!\n\nWith that said, let's try to understand what the DNS does by making a little DNS table ourselves.\n\nPull out a piece of paper and draw a grid similar to that in the internet activity:\n\nSample of DNS Table:\n\n| #  | URL  | IP Address |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\n| 1  | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;code.org&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  | &nbsp;&nbsp;54.243.71.82&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n| 2  |   |   |\n| 3  |   |   |\n| 4  |   |   |\n| 5  |   |   |\n\n\n<br/>First, we need to fill in this table.\n\n- Survey the class for their favorite websites and write the URLs in the left column\n- Use a site like ***get-site-ip.com** to find the IP addresses for those sites and write them in the corresponding rows of the right column.\n\nNow let's take this DNS Table and pretend to send messages through the internet!"

Wi-Fi doesn’t require cables, but since the signal bounces all over the place, packets can get lost pretty easily.\n\t- Simulation: Internet must carry each packet on their shoulder (no hands).\n- Cable/DSL: Fairly good at delivering messages, but you must be connected to a wire.\n\t- Simulation: Internet must carry each packet on the back of one hand and must keep the other hand touching a wall, desk, chair or the floor at all times.\n-  Fiber Optic Cable: The best at delivering messages, but you must be connected to a wire.\n\t- Simulation: Internet can carry packets in hand, but must keep the other hand touching a wall, desk, chair or the floor at all times."
