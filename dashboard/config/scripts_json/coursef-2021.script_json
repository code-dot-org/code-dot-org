        "purpose": "Today's concept, `for` loops, are a very important topic in computer science. Not only are they widely used, the process of learning `for` loops enhances the learning of other important concepts (such as variables and parameters.) Students will have plenty of practice critically thinking through problems by determining the starting, ending, and stepping values for each `for` loop. This concept uses plenty of math as well, so feel free to pair it with a math lesson for an even deeper learning experience.",

This project will help individuals gain experience with coding and produce an exemplar to share with peers and loved ones. This is intended to be a multi-lesson or multi-week project where students spend time brainstorming, learning about the design process, building, and then presenting their final work. \r\n\r\nIn the \"Explore\" stage, students will play around with pre-built Artist and Sprite Lab programs for inspiration. Next, students will learn about the design process and how to implement it in their own projects. They will then be given the space to create their own project in Artist, Sprite Lab, or any other interface that you are comfortable providing. (This is likely the longest stage of the project.) Students will then revise their code after testing and peer review. Finally, students will be able to present their finished work to their classmates.",

Maybe the everyone in the whole school? Goodness, that's going to take a while! Pose the question to your students:\r\n\r\n\"How could I do this more quickly?\"\r\n\r\nYour students will likely pick up on the fact that only one word is changing, and that word is simply a person's name. Help them see the location by circling Jenny's name on the board and writing \"firstName\" next to it.\r\n\r\n\"It would take a long time to write a poem for everyone in the school if I couldn't start until I knew who I was writing it about, wouldn't it?\"\r\n\r\n- How long do you think it would take to make a video game if they couldn't start until they knew your username?\r\n- How expensive would video games be if they had to be created separately for each person?\r\n- How do you think we can get around that?\r\n\r\nBy this time, it's quite likely that your class will come up with the idea of having a placeholder. With that, they're most of the way into understanding where this lesson goes.\r\n\r\n- What would we call that placeholder?\r\n\t- We need to call it something that makes sense. We wouldn't want to call it \"age\" if it was a placeholder for their name, right?\r\n\r\nNow, let's add some more volunteers. Give them each a piece of paper to write their name on, and have them tuck it inside individual envelopes labeled firstName.\r\n\r\nThis time, put the poem on the board with a blank space labeled \"firstName\" where the student's name will go. \r\n\r\n- Have the first student in line (likely the last student from the previous example) pull their name from the envelope and that's what you'll write in the space.\r\n- When you erase the board, only erase the portion with the last student's name in it. \r\n- Call the next student to show their variable. \r\n- Repeat as many times as is entertaining\r\n\r\nNow it's time for the main activity.",

Direct students to Code Studio or project the level on the board.\n\n\n\n#### Running Simulations\n\n**Step 1 Gather Data**: The first bubble is a simple simulation of an elephant and a hippo collecting apples. Students will run the simulation at least 5 times, recording the number of apples collected by each animal and the total time it took to run the simulation.\n\n**Step 2 Line Graph**: Using the data collected in the previous step, students will plot a double line graph. Encourage students to share their graphs with neighbors and discuss the following questions:\n\n* Are the graphs the same or different? Why do you think that is?\n* Do you see any patterns?\n* What do you think you'd see if you ran this simulation 5 more times?\n\n**Step 3 Modify and Predict**: In the second bubble students will be able to modify some of the variables that control this simulation. Each student will choose a variable to modify, predict how that change will impact the simulation. Potential variables to modify include:\n\n* Number of elephants\n* Number of hippos\n* Number of apples\n* Speed of elephants\n* Speed of hippos\n\n**Step 4 Collecting More Data**: With the modifications students decided on in the last step, they'll run the simulation five more times and collect the data.\n\n**Step 5 Visualize Your Data**: This step is purposefully left open to allow students to explore any visual representation of their data that they'd like. The goal of this visual should be to prove or disprove their prediction.\n\n\n\n**Share**: After finishing, students can share their results with a neighbor.

Since this tutorial includes videos and students may be wearing headphones it can get easy to \"go into a bubble\". Help break those barriers by actively pairing students.\n* **Read the Instructions:** The instructions usually provide helpful information about what is happening behind the scenes. \n* **Go back and try different things:** If students finish quickly, encourage them to go back to \"Train More\". In the last part of the activity, students can also go back and choose a \"New Word\". More training data tends to make the machine learning model more accurate and consistent.

What do you suppose the process would be like for me to send a message to request that page?\r\n\t- What do I do as a user?\r\n\t- What do you think happens inside the internet?\r\n\r\nSending a message over the internet is a lot like sending a message through the mail...if every letter we sent required thousands of envelopes!\r\n\r\nEvery message we send through the internet gets chopped up and each piece is wrapped in its own version of an envelope. We call those \"packets.\" Packets are specially formed chunks of information that are able to easily flow through any of the internet's channels.\r\n\r\nSometimes, a few of those packets will get lost, because the internet is a crazy place. In that case, the packets need to be resent, and the whole message has to get put on hold until they arrive.\r\n\r\nWhere do you think those packets are headed?\r\n\r\n- Even if you're sending messages to another person, they first have to go to at least one \"server.\"\r\n\t- A server is a special computer that is supposed to be always on and ready to send and receive information.\r\n\t- Every website has a server.\r\n\t- Even email goes through servers.\r\n\r\nServers don't have names like you and I do. They're actually addressed using numbers. These numbers are called IP addresses, and they look a little strange.\r\n\r\n- For example: One of Code.org's IP addresses used to be 54.243.71.82\r\n\t- (Please be sure to check this out in advance. Most IP addresses change from time to time and they are then reused for other sites.)\r\n\r\nThere are many ways to reach the internet from your house, school, or place of business.\r\n\r\n- You can connect directly using a cable (that might be DSL, Cable, or Fiber Optic)\r\n- Or you can connect using radio waves over the air through Wi-Fi\r\n\r\nDirect connections are most reliable, but they can be inconvenient.\r\n\r\n- Can you figure out why?\r\n\t- (You have to be attached to a cable!)\r\n\r\nWi-Fi connections are super convenient, but the aren't always reliable.\r\n\r\n- Can you figure out why not?\r\n\t- (Radio waves bounce all over the place and can get lost.)",

That's what the DNS is for. The DNS (Domain Name Server) has tables that allow the system to go back and forth between URLs and IP addresses. If the Domain Name Servers ever stopped working, it would shut down the internet as we know it!\r\n\r\nWith that said, let's try to understand what the DNS does by making a little DNS table ourselves.\r\n\r\nPull out a piece of paper and draw a grid similar to that in the internet activity:\r\n\r\nSample of DNS Table:\r\n\r\n| #  | URL  | IP Address |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| 1  | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;code.org&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  | &nbsp;&nbsp;54.243.71.82&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\r\n| 2  |   |   |\r\n| 3  |   |   |\r\n| 4  |   |   |\r\n| 5  |   |   |\r\n\r\n\r\n<br/>First, we need to fill in this table.\r\n\r\n- Survey the class for their favorite websites and write the URLs in the left column\r\n- Use a site like [get-site-ip.com](http://get-site-ip.com/) to find the IP addresses for those sites and write them in the corresponding rows of the right column.\r\n\r\nNow let's take this DNS Table and pretend to send messages through the internet!"

Wi-Fi doesn’t require cables, but since the signal bounces all over the place, packets can get lost pretty easily.\r\n\t- Simulation: Internet must carry each packet on their shoulder (no hands).\r\n- Cable/DSL: Fairly good at delivering messages, but you must be connected to a wire.\r\n\t- Simulation: Internet must carry each packet on the back of one hand and must keep the other hand touching a wall, desk, chair or the floor at all times.\r\n-  Fiber Optic Cable: The best at delivering messages, but you must be connected to a wire.\r\n\t- Simulation: Internet can carry packets in hand, but must keep the other hand touching a wall, desk, chair or the floor at all times.",
