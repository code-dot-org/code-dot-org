This is important in setting up later lessons in this unit - in this lesson, the guidelines are based on the physical impacts of creating a network but towards the end of the unit students will examine the societal and economical impacts for creating computer networks and will again think critically about how to balance several factors from a societal and economic lens.",

This closely mimics a real life problem that computer scientists had to solve:  With all the bits passing through many computers on a network, how would a computer know if it was the intended recipient?  Which computer should get a reply?  Internet Protocol (IP) solves a portion of this problem by assigning a unique IP address to each device and standardizing how sender and recipient are identified.",

They look at the router logs again to notice that messages are being passed between routers in order to reach their destination.

The lesson wraps-up by introducing new vocabulary and using these words to summarize today’s activity.",

        "purpose": "After yesterday’s lesson that motivated the need for some kind of addressing system, today’s lesson has students use IP Addresses to send messages to specific people. Today’s focus is on how routers help manage the paths that different messages take. The router logs are an important tool for students to discover the extra work that routers are doing to send messages - they can see that messages are passed between routers and that messages take different paths along the way, all from analyzing the data in the router logs. Importantly, students should make a connection between these observations about multiple pathways and the concept of **fault-tolerance** - because there are multiple pathways, the internet can continue to function even when there may be an issue that the routers need to address.",

First students explore a version of the Internet Simulator that breaks messages into packets to get a sense for how it works. Students then use an activity guide that walks them through the challenges that dropped or out-of-order packets create. They then design their own protocol that addresses these challenges. At the end of the lesson students watch a video and learn and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), two different protocols for sending messages broken into packets.",
        "student_overview": "Learn how information travelling over the Internet is divided into many packets that travel separately through the network as well as the protocols that allow this process to work even when some packets are lost or delayed.",
        "purpose": "Information on the Internet is not sent all at once, but is instead broken into smaller chunks of data called packets. Each packet is sent through the Internet individually and may actually take different paths or arrive at different times than others. Once they arrive the receiver will use the packets to recreate the original file.\n\nTwo protocols used to send data as packets are UDP and TCP. The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) simply sends all the packets. If some arrive out of order or are entirely missing there's no system to fix the errors. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) numbers packets before sending them so that the receiver can correctly reorder the packets and request missing packets be resent. \n\nOnly one of these two protocols will be used, depending on the situation. TCP takes longer than UDP because of the error-checking done to guarantee every packet was received. TCP is used to send information like emails, images, websites, and more where saving fractions of a second is less important than accuracy. In instances like live-streaming television or online gaming where speed is most important, UDP will be used since it is faster and there's less benefit to correcting errors.\n\nThis lesson gives students a hands-on experience with the ideas behind both protocols and helps them understand the implications of splitting large files into packets when sending them online.\n\nNote: UDP is not covered in the video at the end of the lesson.\n",

So why not get to know it?\" But you don't have to take Vint Cerf's word. Some of the largest issues facing society hinge on an understanding of how the Internet functions.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this unit you will do a project focusing on a societal issues. As you go through these lessons keep you ears and eyes open for how things work.\r\n\r\nMany of the issues are related to people taking advantage of the open protocols that make the Internet function and present us with tricky dilemmas. We will learn about protocols late in this unit. \r\n\r\nFor example there are two major issues to think about:\r\n\r\n* Net Neutrality is a raging legal debate about the principle that Internet service providers should enable access to all content and applications regardless of the source, and without favoring or blocking particular products or websites.\r\n\r\n* Internet Censorship is the attempt to control or suppress of what can be accessed, published, or viewed on the Internet by certain people. This can be used to protect people (i.e. to not allow access to child pornography) but can also be used to limit free speech.\r\n\r\nTo have an informed opinion though it helps to understand the technical underpinnings of how the internet works.\r\n\r\nFinally, a major issue that our society faces is that far too few people actually understand how the Internet works!

The most important points for students to understand are that\r\n\r\n* Large files are split into packets to be sent\r\n* Packets may take different routes through the network and arrive out of order\r\n* TCP ensures that packets that arrive out of order or are lost are re-ordered\r\n* Packets include metadata like their IP address or a packet number to help move them through the network or reorganize them when they arrive\r\n* Collectively this system makes the Internet more reliable\r\n\r\n**Covering UDP:** UDP is not covered in the video and students do not need to understand it in great detail. The depth of explanation in the slides is sufficient to explain the differences between them and why each would be used.\r\n"
