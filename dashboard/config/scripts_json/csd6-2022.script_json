Students learn techniques to make the apps they write more flexible by modifying design elements through code instead of always relying on design mode. Using the Circuit Playground, they then explore different approaches to taking input and producing output using hardware. By the end of this chapter, students will design a develop a game that uses physical hardware for input and output.",

Once they have identified a few interesting innovations, they will choose one to analyze in greater depth and report back to the class about.\n\n#### Innovation Research\n\n* **Introduce the topics**: Make sure that students understand the scope of each of the potential topics.\n\t* Wearable Technology (eg. clothing, jewelry, or accessories with built-in computers)\n\t* Health and Safety (eg. devices that treat disease, track your health, or protect users from danger)\n\t* Agriculture (eg. technology to improve the effectiveness, sustainability, or efficiency of farming)\n\t* Manufacturing (eg. advancements in rapid prototyping, industrial robotics, and the production of goods)\n\t* Art and Design (eg. interactive art or public installations)\n\t* Smart Home (eg. devices that allow you to interact with your thermostat, locks, or lights using computers)\n* **Explain the research task**: The goal of this research is twofold:\n\t* First, develop a deeper understanding of your chosen topic. How is computer technology changing this field, what are some of the problems that people are trying to solve with technology?\n    * Second, identify a handful of innovative devices within this topic. Students should focus on finding _hardware_ devices that demonstrate unique or novel _form factors_. That is to say, computers that don't _look_ like computers.\n* **Send to Code Studio**: On Code Studio we have compiled more detailed descriptions of the topics. Students can use this as a jumping off point for keywords to search for with student research. You can also use the teaching tip below as a guide for how to provide your own starting point for student research."

More frivolous wearables or digital art installations may be more concerned with personal expression than solving a specific problem.\r\n* **What Is Innovative About It?:** Encourage students to refer back to the earlier discussion about innovation for this. It can also be useful to compare against other devices found during the research phase.\r\n* **How Do You Interact With It?:** Ask students to think back to the _Input, Output, Storage, Processing_ model that was introduced way back in Unit 1. The goal here is to identify specifically the Inputs and Outputs provided by a given device - the more specific these are, the more easily students will be able to connect elements of the Circuit Playground to these devices.\r\n* **How Could You Improve It?:** Feel free to make this as realistic or aspirational as you like. The goal here is just to get students thinking about how they might develop an innovation of their own by using an existing product as a jumping off point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Share:** Give groups a minute each to share their findings. See the extension activities for alternate ways to share."

Here are a few strategies for facilitating these levels:\n\n_Think-Pair-Share First:_ Consider having students think of their own prediction and discuss with a partner before typing in their response. Once they're run the code, bring the class together for a full-group discussion to discuss how their predictions were similar or different from the resulting program. Use this as an opportunity to address any misconceptions that students may have had about the code initially.\n\n_Full-Class First:_ Consider presenting the predict level to the entire class and asking the class to share what they think will happen. Keep track of their predictions at the front of the room, then run the code and compare the result to their predictions. After discussing and clarifying misconceptions, invite students to return to the Predict level on their own and enter in their new understanding of what the level will do.\n\n**Caution: Predict Entries Can't Be Deleted!** Once you enter an answer into the predict box, you are not able to reset it. This can make it difficult to repeat this process with multiple classes. Instead, we recommend entering dummy text like \"Class discussion\" and running the code. This way, the answer isn't \"spoiled\" for future classes. However, this means you will need to keep track of predictions separately such as on a whiteboard or in a document."

Based on what you already know about this board, how do you think you might use it to get input?\n\n**Share:** Have groups share back their thoughts to the whole group, keeping track of ideas on the board. Push students to support their ideas with evidence from reviewing the board, but don't worry about ensuring correctness at this point.\n\n**Discussion Goal:** Students will probably notice the buttons on the circuit playground. Students may also notice the small slider in the middle of the circuit playground that toggles back and forth. If students don’t address these, be sure to bring them up. Students may also ask about the small pads on the outer ring of the circuit playground, or they may notice the eye / ear / temperature icons on the circuit playground for the different sensors. Both of these are types of inputs that are discussed in later lessons - if students bring these up, acknowledge them but also let students know we’ll investigate these more in future lessons.",
