        "description": "**Starting with Problem Solving:** We recommend teaching the first three lessons from the [Problem Solving and Computing unit](/s/csd1-2022), which introduces the Problem Solving Process referenced throughout the course. These lessons also include a pre-survey that you can administer to students.\n\n**Getting Started with Code.org:** Consider watching our [Getting Started with Code.org](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNdX7P76yGw7YUM4Csm1ZZmM) video series for an overview of how to navigate lesson plans, setup a classroom section, and other important features of the Code.org platform. Each video also has a support article if you'd prefer to read or print instructions - [click here to learn more](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/4405629586957-New-how-to-walkthrough-videos-for-teachers-).\n\n**Professional Development:** If you are interested in teaching this course, we recommend completing the free [Physical Computing Self-Paced Professional Development Module](https://studio.code.org/courses/self-paced-pl-physical-computing-2022). The module is designed to take 2 hours to complete. No previous experience with coding or physical computing is assumed.\n\n**Setup a Classroom Section:** You can use a class section in Code.org to manage your students, view their progress, and assign specific curriculum - [click here to learn more](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/115000488132-Creating-a-classroom-section).\n\nIf you are using a learning management system, there may be additional steps to sync your classes with Code.org:\n\n- [Click here](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/115001319312-Setting-up-sections-with-Google-Classroom-sync) for steps to setup your classes with Google Classroom\n- [Click Here](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/115002716111-Setting-up-sections-with-Clever-sync) for steps to setup your classes with Clever\n\n**Become a Verified Teacher:** Lesson plans and levels have additional resources and answer keys for Verified Teachers, which is quick process that verifies your position at an educational institution. [Click here to complete a form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdGGAJuaDMBVIRYnimPhAL96w6fCl4UdvhwmynGONM75TWwWw/viewform) and you should have access to verified teacher resources in ~1 business day. Verified teachers also have access to the [\"Teacher's Lounge\"](https://forum.code.org/c/csd/csd-teachers-lounge/444) section of the forums.\n\n**Get Inspired:** Consider watching our [Teacher Tips video playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNcc7Q-PvUVqV249l2JzhJes), featuring current CS Discoveries teachers.\n\n**Introducing App Lab:**  This unit assumes students are already familiar with App Lab. If you have students who have not worked in App Lab and Design Mode before, consider spending some additional class time introducing just enough App Lab to students for them to be successful in this unit. For example, by having students complete the [App Lab Hour of Code Tutorial](https://studio.code.org/s/applab-intro/reset)",

More frivolous wearables or digital art installations may be more concerned with personal expression than solving a specific problem.\n* **What Is Innovative About It?:** Encourage students to refer back to the earlier discussion about innovation for this. It can also be useful to compare against other devices found during the research phase.\n* **How Do You Interact With It?:** Ask students to think back to the _Input, Output, Storage, Processing_ model that was introduced way back in Unit 1. The goal here is to identify specifically the Inputs and Outputs provided by a given device - the more specific these are, the more easily students will be able to connect elements of the Circuit Playground to these devices.\n* **What is the Impact?:** Encourage students to think of the people who are affected by this innovation. Most innovations were probably designed to improve someone's life, and students can write about the impact this could have on individuals. But some devices may have unexpected or unintended consequences, and students can reflect on how those consequences could affect individuals.",

This can make it difficult to repeat this process with multiple classes. Instead, we recommend entering dummy text like \"Class discussion\" and running the code. This way, the answer isn't \"spoiled\" for future classes.

Instead, every task in a challenge level is meant to supplement and enrich the learning objectives of a lesson, but are not required for future lessons. Students can still demonstrate mastery of the objectives of a lesson without completing any of the challenge levels.\n\n**Digging Deeper:** For more tips about programming levels, see the [CSD Guide to Programming Levels](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WGywQ25khB6-FB20x6wO9dGVO9_qJlWkuLVLREJS4Jo/preview).

This helps students prepare and communicate their issue before asking for help.\n- If students haven't seen it yet, consider showing the [Debugging Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auv10y-dN4s) to the class to reinforce debugging best practices.\n\n**Digging Deeper:** Consider supplying students with an object to talk to as part of the debugging process.

This helps students prepare and communicate their issue before asking for help.\n- If students haven't seen it yet, consider showing the [Debugging Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auv10y-dN4s) to the class to reinforce debugging best practices.\n\n**Digging Deeper:** Consider supplying students with an object to talk to as part of the debugging process.

To help smooth out the debugging experience, consider the following strategies:\n\n- Review the [Teacher Guide to Debugging](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-mXz53CAQ1dy3-RVGkoUnR0hfAwdWeza4kch6NAvLb8/edit) for some common questions and strategies to help support students in debugging their code\n- Have students follow the steps in the [Student Guide to Debugging](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wNwoKDyoUas5GGkhqGmNN1u0XGQEdeOMWhSziyYIf8o/edit#) and use the [Bug Report Quarter-Sheets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M6mnq73DfyvzasucVAwfL-gjl2JqVPzjy_fRx5j4j7c/preview) as an initial step in the debugging process. This helps students prepare and communicate their issue before asking for help.\n- If students haven't seen it yet, consider showing the [Debugging Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auv10y-dN4s) to the class to reinforce debugging best practices.\n\n**Digging Deeper:** Consider supplying students with an object to talk to as part of the debugging process. This is sometimes known as Rubber Duck Debugging - you can learn more on the website https://rubberduckdebugging.com/"
