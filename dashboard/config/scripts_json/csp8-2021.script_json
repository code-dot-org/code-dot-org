The most important points to note:\r\n\r\n* The written responses are the most important part of the Create PT.\r\n* It's OK to submit a small or even incomplete project so long as it has a working feature you can show in your video and has a list and function that meets the requirements.\r\n* Most ideas can and should be narrowed down before you start.\r\n* You shouldn't be doing a lot of work in Design Mode or worrying about how your app looks until the end.\r\n\r\n[slide] **Practice Narrowing It Down (page 6) - 10 mins:** Have students go through one of the three project ideas and practice helping the example student narrow down their project. Give students roughly 5 minutes to discuss ideas with a partner. Then have a couple volunteers from each project idea share how they helped narrow down the project idea.\r\n\r\n**Discuss:** Lead a discussion about how to narrow down project ideas.\r\n\r\n* Many projects have sub parts, each of which could stand on its own as a PT\r\n* You should be able to easily see a list and function opportunity within at least one of the sub parts -- if you can't, not a good choice.\r\n* For any project idea it should be relatively easy to scope it down to one or two things that will be totally acceptable for the Create PT\r\n\r\n[slide] **Choosing a Project Idea (page 8) - 5 mins:** Quickly read this section with students and review and high level questions as a class. The main takeaways are below.\r\n\r\n* You don't actually have that much time to work!\r\n* When you start, you should have an idea about what your list and function will be.\r\n* Start with a narrowly scoped project, start working right away on the core parts of it.\r\n* Don't try to learn new programming skills during the PT - do something you know how to do now.\r\n* Get to the written responses as quickly as you can."
