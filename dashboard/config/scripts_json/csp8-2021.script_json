The most important points to note:\n\n* The written responses are the most important part of the Create PT.\n* It's OK to submit a small or even incomplete project so long as it has a working feature you can show in your video and has a list and function that meets the requirements.\n* Most ideas can and should be narrowed down before you start.\n* You shouldn't be doing a lot of work in Design Mode or worrying about how your app looks until the end.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Practice Narrowing It Down (page 6) - 10 mins:** Have students go through one of the three project ideas and practice helping the example student narrow down their project. Give students roughly 5 minutes to discuss ideas with a partner. Then have a couple volunteers from each project idea share how they helped narrow down the project idea.\n\n**Discuss:** *Lead a discussion about how to narrow down project ideas.*\n* Many projects have sub parts, each of which could stand on its own as a PT\n* You should be able to easily see a list and function opportunity within at least one of the sub parts -- if you can't, not a good choice.\n* For any project idea it should be relatively easy to scope it down to one or two things that will be totally acceptable for the Create PT\n\n**Discussion Goal:** Understand it doesn't have to be a big project; The create PT is about demonstrating something you already know how to do.  \n\nThe biggest thing we're trying to guard against is students' eyes being bigger than their stomachs.  We want to encourage students to be creative and start build whatever they want, but temper that with the realities of the Create PT...\n\n* It doesn't need to be a big project\n* Your job is to demonstrate that you know how to program something and identify certain aspects of it.\n* There are no points for coolness or prettiness\n* If you want to do something big, just get it started for the Create PT and come back to it afterward.\n"
