        "description": "**General Support:** As a teacher your role is primarily to support students as they make their way through the tutorial. Here are a few tips that should help students regardless of the level they're working on\n\n* **Checking Correctness:** This tutorial will not tell students whether they completed the level correctly. Encourage students to use the target images and directions provided in every level to know if they are on the right track. If students want to move on past a particularly tricky level they can simply click \"Finish\" and continue on.\n* **Collaborate with Neighbors:** Encourage students to check in with a neighbor when they're getting stuck. Since this tutorial includes videos and students may be wearing headphones it can get easy to \"go into a bubble\". Help break those barriers by actively pairing students if they seem like they need help.\n* **Read the Instructions:** The instructions usually provide helpful tips on how to complete the level. Before completing a level for a student ensure they've actually looked closely at the target image and read all the text there.\n* **Stuck? Click here:** Each level includes a GIF showing exactly how to complete the level. If students want help they can and should use these GIFs. If they only want to use them as a hint, just have them close the GIF once they've seen the first part.\n* **Move On and Come Back:** Sometimes students will benefit more from coming back to a tricky level. Except for the \"Design Mode\" sequence, all levels are independent of one another, though they do rely to some degree on previously introduced concepts.",

When in doubt, students should first change the first two dropdowns, then use the last one as a model for what values work there. The most common error is failing to use double quotes around a color name.\n* **Hover to Read IDs:** By hovering over an element in your app you can read its ID.

This is never the intended behavior for this tutorial. Even though this is mentioned in the videos, a quick reminder might help get kids unstuck.\n* **Check Your IDs:** You need to change the `\"id\"` property in `onEvent()` so that it detects events with the correct element.\n* **You Can Use Multiple Blocks in an `onEvent()`:** If you want multiple things to happen when you click the same button, just add more blocks to the same `onEvent()`. You should never have a program that has two `onEvent()` blocks for the combination of element (e.g. \"button1\") and event type (e.g. \"click\").",

Student responses may vary but may include the following strategies:\n* Scan each row from left to right followed by scanning each column from top to bottom.\n* Check surrounding letters. Once you found the first letter or a key letter in a word you’re searching for, check the letters around it to see if you should keep going. For example, if you have a word with Q in it, if there’s no U next to it, then you need to keep searching.\n* Look for words that have less-common letters in them such as words with a Q, X, J, or Z\n* Look for words with letter pairs, such as double letters or QU\n* Look for more than one word at a time.\n* Turn the puzzle upside down\n\n**Do This:** Direct students to pick ONE strategy from the list that they want to try and put a “#1” next to it in their journals to indicate it was their first strategy used. Once they pick a strategy, direct students to use that strategy in their word search.\n",

You can show students our [Debugging Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auv10y-dN4s), which includes several students normalizing mistakes and discussing debugging strategies that students can use. Additionally, consider displaying the [Student Guide to Debugging](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wNwoKDyoUas5GGkhqGmNN1u0XGQEdeOMWhSziyYIf8o/edit#) for students to reference throughout the unit and having [Bug Report Quarter-Sheets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M6mnq73DfyvzasucVAwfL-gjl2JqVPzjy_fRx5j4j7c/preview) available for students to use."

To help smooth out the debugging experience, consider the following strategies:\n\n- Review the [Teacher Guide to Debugging](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-mXz53CAQ1dy3-RVGkoUnR0hfAwdWeza4kch6NAvLb8/edit) for some common questions and strategies to help support students in debugging their code\n- Have students follow the steps in the [Student Guide to Debugging](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wNwoKDyoUas5GGkhqGmNN1u0XGQEdeOMWhSziyYIf8o/edit#) and use the [Bug Report Quarter-Sheets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M6mnq73DfyvzasucVAwfL-gjl2JqVPzjy_fRx5j4j7c/preview) as an initial step in the debugging process. This helps students prepare and communicate their issue before asking for help.\n- If students haven't seen it yet, consider showing the [Debugging Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auv10y-dN4s) to the class to reinforce debugging best practices."

Prototypes are designed to be slightly messy so they can be iterated on quickly, and they will never be perfect.

To help smooth out the debugging experience, consider the following strategies:\n\n- Review the [Teacher Guide to Debugging](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-mXz53CAQ1dy3-RVGkoUnR0hfAwdWeza4kch6NAvLb8/edit) for some common questions and strategies to help support students in debugging their code\n- Have students follow the steps in the [Student Guide to Debugging](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wNwoKDyoUas5GGkhqGmNN1u0XGQEdeOMWhSziyYIf8o/edit#) and use the [Bug Report Quarter-Sheets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M6mnq73DfyvzasucVAwfL-gjl2JqVPzjy_fRx5j4j7c/preview) as an initial step in the debugging process. This helps students prepare and communicate their issue before asking for help.\n- If students haven't seen it yet, consider showing the [Debugging Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auv10y-dN4s) to the class to reinforce debugging best practices.\n\n**Digging Deeper:** Consider supplying students with an object to talk to as part of the debugging process. This is sometimes known as Rubber Duck Debugging - you can learn more on the website https://rubberduckdebugging.com/"

This will let them re-reconnect their board to App Lab.\n\nIf students continue to have issues, refer to the Troubleshooting section of our [Maker Support Article](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/115003407851-Maker-Toolkit-Support-for-Circuit-Playground-and-micro-bit)\n\n**Debugging Strategies:** As students design and implement their own project ideas, they may find themselves with new bugs that they need to untangle and you may find yourself looking at completely unfamiliar code as students look for help troubleshooting their errors. To help smooth out the debugging experience, consider the following strategies:\n\n- Review the [Teacher Guide to Debugging](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-mXz53CAQ1dy3-RVGkoUnR0hfAwdWeza4kch6NAvLb8/edit) for some common questions and strategies to help support students in debugging their code\n- Have students follow the steps in the [Student Guide to Debugging](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wNwoKDyoUas5GGkhqGmNN1u0XGQEdeOMWhSziyYIf8o/edit#) and use the [Bug Report Quarter-Sheets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M6mnq73DfyvzasucVAwfL-gjl2JqVPzjy_fRx5j4j7c/preview) as an initial step in the debugging process. This helps students prepare and communicate their issue before asking for help.\n- If students haven't seen it yet, consider showing the [Debugging Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auv10y-dN4s) to the class to reinforce debugging best practices.\n\n**Digging Deeper:** Consider supplying students with an object to talk to as part of the debugging process. This is sometimes known as Rubber Duck Debugging - you can learn more on the website https://rubberduckdebugging.com/"

To help smooth out the debugging experience, consider the following strategies:\n\n- Review the [Teacher Guide to Debugging](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-mXz53CAQ1dy3-RVGkoUnR0hfAwdWeza4kch6NAvLb8/edit) for some common questions and strategies to help support students in debugging their code\n- Have students follow the steps in the [Student Guide to Debugging](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wNwoKDyoUas5GGkhqGmNN1u0XGQEdeOMWhSziyYIf8o/edit#) and use the [Bug Report Quarter-Sheets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M6mnq73DfyvzasucVAwfL-gjl2JqVPzjy_fRx5j4j7c/preview) as an initial step in the debugging process. This helps students prepare and communicate their issue before asking for help.\n- If students haven't seen it yet, consider showing the [Debugging Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auv10y-dN4s) to the class to reinforce debugging best practices.\n\n**Digging Deeper:** Consider supplying students with an object to talk to as part of the debugging process. This is sometimes known as Rubber Duck Debugging - you can learn more on the website https://rubberduckdebugging.com/"
