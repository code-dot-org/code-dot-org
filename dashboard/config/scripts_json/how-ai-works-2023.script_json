You play by guessing a word that is \"closest\" to a target word in a list.\n- [Semantle](https://semantle.com/) is a Wordle-ish variant that allows players to guess a secret word by finding words that are slowly getting closer in distance. \n- [Mind Meld](https://www.hooplaimpro.com/mind-meld) is an improv game that has two people say two random words at the same time, then try to find the word that is most common or \"between\" these two other words. They repeat this process - saying both words at the same time - with the goal of both people saying the same word at the same time. This means they've successfully \"closed the distance\" from their starting words by successively finding words they had in common.\n\nAll of these are optional and not part of the lesson plan, but can be interesting or fun \"brain breaks\" during other lessons or downtime in class.\n\n**Digging Deeper:** If you would like more information about the models behind Large Language Models, the YouTube channel [AI Coffee Break with Letitia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH-wmtxHunk&list=PLpZBeKTZRGPNdymdEsSSSod5YQ3Vu0sKY&index=2) has a lot of great explanatory videos on this topic.

But, if you believe you will have extra time and would like to further understand this version of image generation, you can run an [optional 20 minute GAN activity](#activity-activity-6) described near the end of this lesson plan.\n\n**Why Diffusion?** Students may wonder where the term \"diffusion\" comes from. If so, it may help to show a video of a physical diffusion process, such as food coloring dispersing in water (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Peg1yaB2bsk\">such as in this video</a>). If you show this video or a demonstration, point out that the food coloring is somewhat randomly slowly distributing itself throughout the water. This is what will happen with noise being added to images in diffusion models.\n\n**Who Owns the Image?** For this discussion, some possible answers are:\n- the people who designed the images the AI learned on\n- The programmer who created the tool\n- The person who wrote the prompt\n- none of the above\n\nIf you linger on this question during the video, consider using the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/evaluation/pdf/brief7.pdf\">Nominal Group Technique</a> and circulate, listening for students who are saying particularly interesting things to bring up with the whole group.\n\n**Diving Deeper:** Questions of ownership, copyright, and labor are hotly debated as generative AI continues to expand. Many generative AI systems used images from living artists and can generate art in a similar style, even though their images were used without their consent and without payment. If students are interested in this ethical question, consider discussing this article with students: [Artists Are Suing Artificial Intelligence Companies and...](https://www.artnews.com/art-in-america/features/midjourney-ai-art-image-generators-lawsuit-1234665579/)"

Ensure students that these types of decisions are everywhere, beyond just this image and cropping algorithm issue, and it's how we respond that matters (as we'll see shortly with how Twitter responded). Remind students that they are future leaders and being aware of how bias creeps into decisions and into our data will make them better equipped to solve problems like these when they see them in the future."
