Then, they will modify the behavior of the boat so it only moves within a specific area. Third, students will program a new event to specify a “fishing season” and a “no fishing season”.

First you’ll add code to count the number of fish caught by the boat and stop the boat from catching more fish once it reaches its limit. Then, you will limit the area in which the boat is allowed to fish. Third, you’ll create a fishing season and a no fishing season to allow the fish time to recover.

If the program isn’t doing what they expected, ask the student to first tell you what they want to happen, click run to observe what is actually happening, then find the place in their code that caused the discrepancy.
