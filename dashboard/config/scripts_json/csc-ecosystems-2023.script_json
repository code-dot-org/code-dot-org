You will start by adding code to represent the food chain: Fish eat the algae and humans in boats catch the fish. But the ecosystem becomes unbalanced due to humans taking too many fish from the water. When one species of an ecosystem is removed there is an **effect** on the rest of the organisms in the system. In this simulation, the fish eat the algae at a normal rate. But when too many fish are caught and removed from the ecosystem, the algae becomes overgrown which in turn harms the coral reef.",

If the program isn’t doing what they expected, ask the student to first tell you what they want to happen, click run to observe what is actually happening, then find the place in their code that caused the discrepancy. Remember to celebrate finding bugs and fixing bugs. Getting a bug means students are doing a great job building a more complex program. "
