If Jada and Michael are good friends, Jada may want to tell Michael how his actions made her feel, after she gets advice from an adult. If Michael continues to be mean to her, she should immediately tell an adult.\n\n**Ask**: _Which of the 4 rules in S-T-O-P do you think is the most important? Why?_\n\nGive students a moment to think and then informally poll the class. Be sure to emphasize that telling a trusted adult (T) is the single most important thing they should do if they ever experience online meanness."

If they suggest something not from the list, make a clear malfunction reaction and let them know that the command is not understood.\n\nWith cup in hand, ask the class to continue giving you instructions until the first cup is placed.

When you change an algorithm into symbols that a robot (or computer) understands, that's called programming.\n\n\nAsk the class to help you write the \"program\" for that first move by changing the text into an arrow. Then work with them to write down the rest of the moves necessary to complete the pattern.

During online activities, the role of the teacher is primarily one of encouragement and support. Online lessons are meant to be student-centered, so teachers should avoid stepping in when students get stuck. Some ideas on how to do this are: \n\n - Utilize pair programming whenever possible during the activity.\n - Encourage students with questions/challenges to start by asking their partner.\n - Unanswered questions can be escalated to a nearby group, who might already know the solution.\n - Remind students to use the debugging process before you approach.\n - Have students describe the problem that they’re seeing. What is it supposed to do? What does it do? What does that tell you?\n - Remind frustrated students that frustration is a step on the path to learning, and that persistence will pay off.\n - If a student is still stuck after all of this, ask leading questions to get the student to spot an error on their own.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: Show “Discuss” slide\n\n**Discuss:** After providing students with end-of-class warnings, grab everyone's attention and get them to reflect on the experiences that they just had.\n\n - _Did anyone feel frustrated during any of the puzzles?_\n - _Did anyone notice the need to be persistent?_\n\n**Transition:** Have students take a moment to reflect on the lesson for themselves."

This can be done in many ways, but here are a few:\n\n* **Public Demo**: Select a few exemplary volunteers to briefly demo their projects in front of the class. As they do so, have them touch on what the planning-to-coding experience was like for them, including ideas they'd still like to implement. \n* **Pair Playtesting**: Have students or groups pair up and playtest each other's projects. As they do, ask them to provide positive and constructive feedback to each other. The benefit here is that students will have the opportunity to provide and respond to feedback in a smaller setting. \n* **Gallery Walk**: Ensure all students have their projects ready for testing. Have students move \"musical chairs\"-style to another computer and playtest the project there for a few minutes, until they receive a signal from you to move to another computer. Repeat this every few minutes. While there is less opportunity for structured communication here, this ensures students get to demo as many of their peers' projects as possible.",
