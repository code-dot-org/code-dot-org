Talking about the organization, structure, or role of the content in the page (heading, paragraph, list, etc.) is more accurate than talking about specific aspects of its appearance (such as size or spacing).\n\nAlthough certain structural roles may be associated with appearance (headings are larger), HTML does not specify anything in particular about the appearance. This allows users with different needs, such as the visually impaired, to interact with the structured content in a way that makes the most sense for them. Later in the unit, students will learn about styles and CSS, which allows them to specify the exact size, color, and spacing of their HTML elements.\n\nThe paragraph tag separates text into paragraphs. You may want to follow up this question by asking students how they think a web browser for the blind might deal with paragraphs. For example, while sighted people may use spacing and new lines to separate out paragraphs, what should a screen reader do?"

In either case, use this discussion to motivate the content vs. structure wrap-up point.\r\n\r\nAs students discuss HTML as a solution, make sure that they are using the key vocabulary of the lesson: \r\n\r\n* **website content** - the text and images on a website\r\n* **website structure** - how the content of a website is organized \r\n* **HTML** - Hypertext Markup Language, a language used to create web pages\r\n* **HTML Element** - A piece of a website, marked by a start tag and often closed with an end tag\r\n* **HTML Tag** - The special set of characters that indicates the start and end of an HTML element and that element's type\r\n\r\nThe content is the literal words that are being typed on the page. Using HTML, students are providing structure to the page, explaining how those pieces of content should be interpreted. Later in the unit students will learn CSS, a language that allows them to individually style elements. For now, however, the styles being applied based on their HTML tags are just the default styles of their web browser. Students don't need to fully understand this difference at this point, as it will be much clearer once they learn CSS later in the unit.\r\n"

Challenge levels tend to focus on more open-ended tasks for students to complete, or opportunities to combine several skills from previous lessons together into one program.\n\nChallenge levels do **not** need to be completed for students to meet the core objectives of a lesson. Instead, every task in a challenge level is meant to supplement and enrich the learning objectives of a lesson, but are not required for future lessons. Students can still demonstrate mastery of the objectives of a lesson without completing any of the challenge levels.\n\n**Digging Deeper:** For more tips about programming levels, see the [CSD Guide to Programming Levels](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WGywQ25khB6-FB20x6wO9dGVO9_qJlWkuLVLREJS4Jo/preview).

This helps students prepare and communicate their issue before asking for help.\n- If students haven't seen it yet, consider showing the [Debugging Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auv10y-dN4s) to the class to reinforce debugging best practices.\n\n**Digging Deeper:** Consider supplying students with an object to talk to as part of the debugging process.

So, for example, the structure could include different headings and paragraphs, but would say nothing about the color of text or how big it is displayed.

Without a particular style, each web browser would decide how to display different web page elements on their own.\n\nStyles are important to allow web developers to decide exactly how a web page looks on the screen.  Because styles are separate from structure and content, web developers can change the style of an entire page very easily, without having to make any changes to the structure and content of the web page.

This helps students prepare and communicate their issue before asking for help.\n- If students haven't seen it yet, consider showing the [Debugging Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auv10y-dN4s) to the class to reinforce debugging best practices.\n\n**Digging Deeper:** Consider supplying students with an object to talk to as part of the debugging process.

To help smooth out the debugging experience, consider the following strategies:\n\n- Review the [Teacher Guide to Debugging](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-mXz53CAQ1dy3-RVGkoUnR0hfAwdWeza4kch6NAvLb8/edit) for some common questions and strategies to help support students in debugging their code\n- Have students follow the steps in the [Student Guide to Debugging](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wNwoKDyoUas5GGkhqGmNN1u0XGQEdeOMWhSziyYIf8o/edit#) and use the [Bug Report Quarter-Sheets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M6mnq73DfyvzasucVAwfL-gjl2JqVPzjy_fRx5j4j7c/preview) as an initial step in the debugging process. This helps students prepare and communicate their issue before asking for help.\n- If students haven't seen it yet, consider showing the [Debugging Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auv10y-dN4s) to the class to reinforce debugging best practices.\n\n**Digging Deeper:** Consider supplying students with an object to talk to as part of the debugging process. This is sometimes known as Rubber Duck Debugging - you can learn more on the website https://rubberduckdebugging.com/"

To help smooth out the debugging experience, consider the following strategies:\n\n- Review the [Teacher Guide to Debugging](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-mXz53CAQ1dy3-RVGkoUnR0hfAwdWeza4kch6NAvLb8/edit) for some common questions and strategies to help support students in debugging their code\n- Have students follow the steps in the [Student Guide to Debugging](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wNwoKDyoUas5GGkhqGmNN1u0XGQEdeOMWhSziyYIf8o/edit#) and use the [Bug Report Quarter-Sheets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M6mnq73DfyvzasucVAwfL-gjl2JqVPzjy_fRx5j4j7c/preview) as an initial step in the debugging process. This helps students prepare and communicate their issue before asking for help.\n- If students haven't seen it yet, consider showing the [Debugging Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auv10y-dN4s) to the class to reinforce debugging best practices.\n\n**Digging Deeper:** Consider supplying students with an object to talk to as part of the debugging process. This is sometimes known as Rubber Duck Debugging - you can learn more on the website https://rubberduckdebugging.com/"
