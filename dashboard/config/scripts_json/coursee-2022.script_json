We're going to watch a short video about sharing online. As we watch, think about what information is OK to share and what isn't._\n\n**Project** [Slide 6](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1g7JUvuosvwU2f5qixuTJg5sjZ0TAW2iN3oapWlSNqhM/edit#slide=id.g3ed1f0b992_10_0) and show the video **Private and Personal Information**. After the video, invite students to respond to the discussion question and prompt them to give examples of private and personal information. Clarify that **private information** is the most risky to share because it can be used to identify you individually. ([Slide 7](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1g7JUvuosvwU2f5qixuTJg5sjZ0TAW2iN3oapWlSNqhM/edit#slide=id.g3c5590bcca_0_376))\n\n**Say**: _Now, we're going to play another little game. For each example that I say, discuss with your partner whether it is private or personal. To decide, ask yourself, \"Is this information that would also be true for many other people?\" If so, it is personal. If not, it is private._ ([Slide 8](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1g7JUvuosvwU2f5qixuTJg5sjZ0TAW2iN3oapWlSNqhM/edit#slide=id.g3c5590bcca_0_501))\n\nRead aloud the first example, \"Age.\" Remind students to consider whether this is information that would be true of many others. If it is, then it is personal. If not, it is private. Give students one minute to discuss and decide.\n\n**Say**: _If you think this is private information, stand up. If you think it is personal, stay seated._\n\nAfter students stand or stay seated, invite students to explain why they chose the answer they did. Follow up by prompting them to refer back to the definitions of private and personal. If necessary, help students clarify that there are many people (in their school, in their city, even in the class) who are the same age as them.\n\n**Say**: _Everyone who is still seated, you are correct! This information is personal, not private._\n\nRepeat the game above for each of the examples:\n\n* home address (**private**)\n* email address (**private**)\n* date of birth (**private**)\n* favorite music (**personal**)\n* how many brothers and sisters you have (**personal**)\n* phone numbers (**private**)\n* credit card information (**private**)\n* favorite food (**personal**)\n* name of your pet (**personal**)\n* name of your school (**private**) (Explain that although school name is something that is true for many people, it is risky to share it with someone you don't know, and you should get permission from a trusted adult first.)"

All of a sudden, our chorus would be a function of repeated actions, rather than words.\r\n- Use the concepts of the arrows from the Graph Paper Programming lesson and create a program with lots of repeating instructions.\r\n\t- Circle those repeating actions so that the class can see where they are.\r\n\t- Define a function called \"Chorus\" above the program.\r\n\t- Cross out everywhere the repeating actions appear in the program and write \"Chorus\" instead.\r\n- Repeat until the class can go through this process with little direction."

In a function declaration, you fill in the function with code and you give the function a name. You must declare a function before you can use it.\n\n2. **The Call**:\n\tFunction calls are what makes the program run the code in the function. To call a function, you place the name of the function in your program. Make sure your function is properly defined before calling it in your program.\n    \nThe class can use songwriting as an example to understand these two components. In the unplugged activity, the function containing the lyrics to the chorus was named \"chorus\". When we first made this function, we circled the lyrics that would go in the function. Once we named the function, we could read through the lyrics and replace the repeated chorus lyrics with a function call to \"chorus\".\n\nContinue the conversation until students have a basic understanding of functions being declared and called.

While displaying a scenario image, read its accompanying script to the class (see below). Discussion questions are included in relevant slides.\n\n#### Designing for Accessibility Scenarios\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> *Slide 1: Meet Wei*\n\n* Wei is a talented kid who LOVES music. She plays piano and sings very well! \n* Wei is visually impaired. While she is not completely blind, it is very difficult for her to see things, even if they are near her eyes.\n* Wei has had to learn piano differently from kids who aren’t visually impaired, but that hasn’t stopped her from becoming a great musician! \n* Wei recently began creating her own music. She is very proud of it! She would like to record and share her music with her friends.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> *Slide 2: Introducing Grammaphone!*\n\n* Grammaphone is a popular new app that allows people to upload and share their own music with friends. \n\n**Discuss**: What do you think about this app? How do you think this app works?\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> *Slide 3: Wei and Grammaphone*\n\n* Wei needs to use Grammaphone to share her music. After all, it’s the most popular music-sharing app!\n* However, she’s having a difficult time using the app. Why do you think that is? \n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> *Slide 4: Meet Roger*\n\n* Roger is an energetic kid who loves video games! He especially likes playing sports games with his friends.\n* Things have been hard for Roger lately, though. A few years ago, Roger’s hand had to be “amputated” (surgically removed) due to an accident. \n* Thankfully, computer scientists, engineers, and doctors are working hard to provide Roger with a cool-looking robotic “prosthetic hand,” which will be awesome!\n* But for now, Roger wants to play sports video games with his friends! \n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> *Slide 5: Introducing Football Frenzy!*\n\n* Football Frenzy is a new mobile game that everyone loves!\n* It has cool graphics, awesome sound effects, tight controls, and amazing action!\n\n**Discuss**: What do you think about this app? How do you think this game is played?\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> *Slide 6: Roger and Football Frenzy*\n\n* All of Roger’s friends play Football Frenzy. It’s connected online so that you can play it anywhere!\n* Roger wants to play Football Frenzy with them, but he is having a difficult time. Why do you think that is?\n\n*<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> Slide 7: Designing for Accessibility* \n\n* Neither of these apps was designed with people like Wei and Roger in mind.\n* When it comes to these apps, what specific features do you think Wei and Roger wish for? \n* Let’s redesign these apps! \n\n####App Redesign Activity (25 min)\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: “Your turn!” slide\n\nThe final scenario allows students to sketch a redesign of one app from the scenarios (\"Grammaphone\" for Wei or \"Football Frenzy\" for Roger). \n\nStudents should primarily focus their efforts on making their redesigned app more accessible for either of them, along with any other accessibility features they can think of. Students can design as many screens for the app as they wish, and they do not need to make their app look anything like the original examples.\n\nIf there is time, students may redesign apps for both characters.\n\n**Distribute**: Pass out crayons/pencils/etc. to each student as they open their reflection journals. \n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: “Share Out” slide\n\n**Share**: After designing, students share their app design with a neighbor, or if there is time, some students can share with the whole class. Each student should answer how their app design addresses the need of the user in question."

Creating can be a lot of hard work, but it is one of the most rewarding things we do. Sharing what we create is fun, and it can encourage more creativity and art. As we get older, we have more and more opportunities to share our work and explore media and art that other people have created. We want to make sure we are always fair when using others’ art and creative work.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: Show “Copyright” slide\n\n**Say:** _Remember, copyright protects all kinds of creative work so that artists/creators can get paid for their eﬀort. This includes, original writing (stories), art, photographs, audio, images, music, song lyrics, even the doodle you drew on your napkin at lunch. It doesn't matter if it was created by a famous artist or by you. When you make an original work, you get to decide who can:_ \n\n- *make copies* \n- *distribute copies*\n- *display or perform the work in public*\n- *make spin‐oﬀs; we call these derivatives (for example, like a book being made into a movie)* \n\n*These rights are given to artists and creators to encourage them to make even more creative work.*\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: Show “Think-Pair-Share” slide\n\n**Think:** Have students think back to the character sketch they created at the beginning of class.

Congratulations! \n\n**Pair:**  \n\n- *How might you know if something is copyrighted?* \n  -  The circle © indicates copyright, but copyright protection exists even without the symbol. Creators have ownership over their work, unless they sell it to someone else.\n- *Where have you seen the copyright symbol?* \n  - At the front of books, in movies, on images, posters, etc.\n\n**Share:** Encourage students to share their answers with the class.\n \n**Demonstrate:** Show students how to draw a copyright symbol and write the year next to it. When you make something creative like this, it’s automatically protected by copyright, even without the copyright symbol. \n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: Show “Discuss” slide\n\n**Discuss:** \n\n- *How does it feel when you share your things with someone else?* \n- *What does it feel like when someone takes your things and shares them without your permission?*\n\n**Say**: *The same principles of respect and fairness apply when we share our work or someone else’s work online.*"
