Students create messages with their systems and exchange with other groups to ensure the system worked as intended. In the wrap-up discussion the class reviews any pros and cons of the different systems. They discuss commonalities between working systems and recognize that there are many possible solutions to this problem and what's important is that everyone uses the same arbitrary system to communicate.\r\n",

Through a series of images showing how this transformation is made students are introduced to the concept of splitting images into squares or \"pixels\" which can then be turned on or off individually to make the entire image. Students then do a short set of challenges using the Pixelation Widget in order to draw black and white images.

What might be less obvious, however, is that the width and height of the image need to be agreed upon in order to interpret the binary image information as well. Finally this is an opportunity to explore how systems for representing information are created. A \"raw\" image is really hard to represent. The idea to turn an image into a grid of black and white squares significantly simplifies this challenge and makes it into the kind of problem that computer scientists knew how to solve. While the activity in this lesson may feel like just typing 0s and 1s, it actually reveals a lot about how people think about representing information in binary, and what challenges and tradeoffs are created as a result.",

Using the results of a preferred pizza topping survey, students must decide what to do with data that does not easily fit into the visualization scheme that they have chosen. Finally, students discuss which parts of this process can be automated by a computer and which need a human to make decisions.",

Computer scientists run up against these same challenges when designing their own representation systems.\r\n\r\nThe simplest solutions to the activity will be to assign each letter a unique pattern of two shapes (e.g. A = \"Pig Pig\", B = \"Pig Elephant\" and so on). Nevertheless there are still an enormous number of systems possible systems with these qualities and likely no two systems in your class will be the same. There is no one \"best\" system and so what matters is that each group collectively decides to use the same one. Again this is true of representation systems students will see in coming lessons.\r\n"
