For this one it's very easy to just yell out what number you would pair with and lose the opporuntity to see how many total checks are necessary if they can just all yell from their seats.\r\n* The group raffle doesn't necessarily need to be silent. As students will see, it's an incredibly difficult problem and they're going to need to do a lot of checking even if they're able to talk out loud.\r\n* Think ahead about whether you actually want to award winners of the raffles. It's pretty unlikely that there will be a winner. \r\n* There's a pretty good chance that no one will win either raffle.\r\n"

Read through the rules together as a class. <br><br>**Rules:**<br><ul><li>You must start and end at your own house.</li><li>You can only visit each house once.</li></ul><br><br>**Discuss:** Students share their paths with a partner before discussing as a class. |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-6---Algorithms2.svg) | **Say:** Take a look at some of these paths on the screen. You may have similar ones in your journal. <br><br> **Discuss:** What do you need to know to determine the best path?   |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-6---Algorithms3.svg) | **Say:** Distance! If we know the distance between each house, we can make a better decision about which path to take. In this example, the first option is shortest, so that's the path we would choose. |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-6---Algorithms4.svg) | **Discuss:** What if we had a lot more places to visit? How would we determine the best path? <br><br> **Discussion Goal:** The goal here is for students to come to the realization that they would need to explore all possible paths in order to determine which one is the best.   |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-6---Algorithms5.svg) | **Say:** This is known as the Traveling Salesman Problem. For each new place to visit, the number of options for possible paths increases factorialy.  |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-6---Algorithms6.svg) | **Say:** A factorial function is written with the letter \"n\" followed by an explanation point. Here's how n! works: Multiply all whole numbers from the given number down to the number 1.<br><br>**Note:** Talk through the examples and the table. The goal here isn't for students to memorize the math, but to understand that with each new house added, the number of potential paths that have to be checked expands very quickly.  | \n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-6---AlgorithmsDecisions.svg) | **Say:** The Traveling Salesman is an Optimization Problem. It's not a Decision Problem. We know there is a path. Now we must determine which is the shortest or most efficient path. |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-6---Algorithms7.svg) | **Say:** The Traveling Salesman Problem can be solved with an algorithm, which checks each possible option. <br><br> BUT, it would take massive amounts of computing power to compare every single option, especially as the number of homes to visit (otherwise known as nodes) increases. <br><br> Therefore, it would take an **unreasonable** amount of time for the solution to be calculated for most instances of the problem. \n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-6---Algorithms8.svg) | **Say:** Welcome to **heuristics**!

During the parallel portion things are in fact moving faster, but sequential portions still take a long time (e.g. collecting individual piles once each group member has sorted their cards). Therefore speedup is rarely your original time divided by the number of computers running the process. Eventually it will level off.\n"

In particular, students may not receive a grade based on performance on topic questions nor can they be used for teacher evaluation. Beyond these requirements, however, they are primarily intended to formatively assess student progress and learning as they prepare for the end of course exam.\n\nWithin our own course we recommend that you use them in a variety of ways:\n\n* Throughout the unit assign topic questions to students related to the topics students are learning about that day or that week\n* Prior to the unit assessment assign topic questions to help students practice and prepare for the summative assessment\n* After the unit assessment use these topic questions to help students track their progress towards preparation for the AP assessment\n\n![](https://images.code.org/850b8144f5c2447b47ddf051a5b03299-Screenshot 2023-04-25 at 3.51.56 PM.png)\n\nClick for more info: [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l9VDL92DCIbTNhTiLGIr-enBOTM4wEDTTQOBlJ7bBhM/edit?usp=sharing)\n"
