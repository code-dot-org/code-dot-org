This version uses drag-drop blocks and works best for students on mobile devices without keyboards, younger students, and international students. It is recommended for ages 6+.\n\nA [JavaScript](s/starwars) version is also available. For older students on computers, learning JavaScript can be fun and provide an additional challenge. Note that JavaScript syntax is not translated and for the first Hour of Code, the translated blocks found here provide a better introduction. This version of the tutorial is also great if you have some students in your class who have already learned some coding. It is recommended for ages 11+.",
        "preparation": "### One Week Before Your Hour of Code\n\n- Review the [Hour of Code Educator Guide](http://hourofcode.com/resources/how-to/) and [Best Practices from Successful Educators](http://www.slideshare.net/TeachCode/hour-of-code-best-practices-for-successful-educators-51273466) in order to begin to plan your Hour of Code event. \n- Review and complete the online tutorial yourself: [Star Wars: Building a Galaxy with Code](https://studio.code.org/s/starwarsblocks/lessons/1/levels/1) \n- Be sure to test it first before asking your students to complete it. Check your technology and decide if you need to troubleshoot anything in advance of your Hour of Code.\n\n### One Day Before Your Hour of Code\n\n- Write the words “coding”, “programming” and “debugging” on the board or add them to your word wall if you have one.\n- Write the words \"Computer Science\" in the middle of your board or on piece of paper at the center of a bulletin board. This will serve as your [\"mind map\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map) for the Getting Ready and Assessment activities.\n- Each student who completes the activity should receive a [certificate](http://code.org/certificates). Print one for each student in advance to make this easier at the end of your Hour of Code.\n",

Today, you will program with blocks on the computer (if you’re using an online tutorial) or with pen and paper (if you’re using an unplugged activity).\n- **Debugging** means to check code for mistakes and try to fix errors.\n\nAsk students to name some jobs they have heard of that are related to coding. Students might mention things such as “programmer”, “computer scientist”, “software developer,” or “engineer”. Capture student responses on your “Computer Science” board, making a mind map of the information your students share. \n\n**Say:** *You’re right, folks! There are no right or wrong answers here...just about any job these days involves some sort of knowledge of code. While there are many, many careers that require some knowledge of coding, learning to code is something anyone can do. And we’re going to do it today.
