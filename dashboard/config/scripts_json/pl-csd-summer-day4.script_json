Afterward, invite them to share what they wrote with a neighbor and then finally bring the whole class together to develop a classwide list of strategies.\n\n**Discussion Goal:** This is a quick, low-stakes brainstorm that asks students to bring in their own experiences with word searches and identify strategies they may have used or could use. Student responses may vary but may include the following strategies:\n* Scan each row from left to right followed by scanning each column from top to bottom.\n* Check surrounding letters. Once you found the first letter or a key letter in a word you’re searching for, check the letters around it to see if you should keep going. For example, if you have a word with Q in it, if there’s no U next to it, then you need to keep searching.\n* Look for words that have less-common letters in them such as words with a Q, X, J, or Z\n* Look for words with letter pairs, such as double letters or QU\n* Look for more than one word at a time.\n* Turn the puzzle upside down\n\n**Do This:** Direct students to pick ONE strategy from the list that they want to try and put a “#1” next to it in their journals to indicate it was their first strategy used. Once they pick a strategy, direct students to use that strategy in their word search.\n",

Bot to recognize, and record this information on their Activity Guide. Students should progress through the level on their own, recording information on their activity guide. On the final screen, have students press the information icon and record the features that A.I. Bot learned were most important.\n\n**Circulate:** Check that students are filling in their activity guide as they complete the stages. Ask students what features they’re looking at to determine if a fish meets their criteria. Students will probably say they primarily use eyes and mouth to help determine expression, but when they click the Information icon on the final screen, A.I. Bot may be using additional features such as color and body to make its decision. Prompt students to think about how they feel about this and compare it to their personal experience - For example, if someone thought they were “silly” or “angry” primarily based on their clothing.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** Show the slide of A.I. Bot learning how to identify fish as “Angry”. Have students discuss the prompt on the screen: _Looking at this screen, why do you think color appeared as the second most important feature?_\n\n **Discussion Goal:** Students should notice that even though the eyes and mouth tend to appear “angry” on every fish, there also appears to be a lot of purple fish on the screen. As a result, A.I. Bot may start to think that the color “purple” is another way to tell if a fish is angry or not.\n"

Students should explore their own ideas and feelings about whether this kind of labeling is appropriate based on the color of the fish. In particular, A.I. Bot has learned “purple fish are angry fish”, which students may have strong reactions to. They may describe similar situations outside of the classroom, such as moments where they’ve been judged by their appearance, gender, or race, to help explain their opinions. This question is designed to start a conversation and connect students’ experiences to the potential pitfalls of machine learning, and it’s okay if the discussion doesn’t come to a firm conclusion. You can let students know that they will continue to learn about and discuss these issues in the rest of the unit. Use the remarks below to help wrap up the discussion."
