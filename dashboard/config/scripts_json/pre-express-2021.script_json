In addition to the ideas listed in the last lesson, some more ideas on how to do this are: \r\n\r\n - Remind students to use the debugging process before you approach.\r\n - Have students describe the problem that they’re seeing. What is it supposed to do? What does it do? What does that tell you?\r\n - Remind frustrated students that frustration is a step on the path to learning, and that persistence will pay off.\r\n - If a student is still stuck after all of this, ask leading questions to get the student to spot an error on their own.\r\n\r\n**Transition:** Have students grab their Thinkspot Journals and take a moment to leave lessons for themselves."
