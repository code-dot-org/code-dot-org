Click <a href=\"https://mbit.io/csf-e4-classroom\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> to start a classroom session for Tilt alarm with micro:bit.\n\n####**Assessment**\nAfter completing the lesson, assess students' knowledge of the concepts covered by assigning them a content assessment hosted on the JuiceMind platform. To assign the assessment to your students, click <a href=\"https://play.juicemind.com/dashboard/explore/class/codeorg-microbit/unitNumber/3/topicNumber/2/quizId/GbTQuzI2M5mkqR5IkDgP\" target=\"_blank\">here.</a>\n\n::: details [**Setting up a micro:bit classroom session**]\nBefore teaching this lesson, make sure to set up a new classroom on the BBC micro:bit platform. Watch this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QD8kpuSC0Vc\" target=\"_blank\">video</a> to learn how to set up a classroom. \n:::\n\n::: details [**Setting up a JuiceMind assessment**]\nClick \"Assign\" on the assessment page, then have students join your unique class session. Students have a link to the Join page on level 2, and will need to enter the class session code. After students complete the assessment, you can view their results on the JuiceMind teacher dashboard.\n\n**Note**: You will need to <a href=\"https://play.juicemind.com/signup\" target=\"_blank\">sign up</a> for an account on JuiceMind to assign the assessment.\n:::"

Does anyone have a favorite dance move?*\n\t- *Have you ever watched a dance team perform to music together? How do they stay in sync?*\n\t\t- *One way to do this might be to plan out all of the moves in advance. It's almost like the dancers are programmed! Computer scientists would call this an algorithm because it's a list of steps to get something done.*\n\t\t- *Another way to keep in sync is to have a cue that tells everyone when to change to a different move. Everyone would still need to know what moves to perform and agree on what the cues mean.*\n\t- *If I want everyone in class to clap at the exact same time, I could do that by giving you a countdown from 3.* (Try it!) \n\t- *When I reached \"1\", that was the event that gave you all the signal to clap.*\n- Ask the class if they can think of any other events that could give signals.\n\t- You may need to remind them that you're not talking about an event like a birthday party or a field trip.\n\t- If they have trouble, you can remind them that an event is an action that causes something to happen.\n\t\t- Blowing a whistle\n\t\t- Waving a flag\n\t\t- Saying a magic word\n\t\t- Pressing a button\n- *Today, we're going to organize our class dance party using events.*",

Just like choosing which type of colors of paint to use, or what kinds of words you write with can express creativity, choosing what code you write and how people interact with it can be an opportunity to express your creativity too!\n\n**Get up and dance:** Announce to the class that today we're going to see how we can combine coding with dancing in a creative way. Ask your kids to floss, dab, or do a creative dance move of their own for 10 seconds to get them in the mood. You can play a song from this ***Spotify Playlist** to help kick things off. Capture your class's moves on video.\n\n![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/girls-flossing.2018-11-01-16_13_52_9Ot0bvX.gif)",

To solve this puzzle, place a `set size` block anywhere in your program and use it to change the size of some of your dancers. \n* Dancers created as a group have a default size of 30. Other dancers have a default size of 100.\n\n##### Level 12\n\n* As with the previous level, make sure to only use the `set tint to (color)` block after you have made the dancers in your program. For example, placing it as the first step in the `setup` area of your program will have no effect.\n\n##### Level 13\n\n* With the right code, you should see the dancer cycle through different colors, sizes, or dance moves.\n* Make sure there is a teal `change`, a teal `randomize` block, or a purple `do forever` block connected inside the `every 2 measures` block. \n* Make sure `do forever` blocks are set to either (Next), (Previous), or (Random). Otherwise, the dancer will just perform the set move repeatedly.\n* Note that the **code students write in this level is not checked for correctness**. This means they will always pass the level, even if they do not change the program. Students should feel free to experiment with their code in ways that are interesting to them. Click the “Finish” button to move on.\n* Making new dancers inside the `every 2 measures` block will cause your program to create multiple identical dancers at the same location(s) and may lead to unintended consequences!\n",

Students can design as many screens for the app as they wish, and they do not need to make their app look anything like the original examples.\n\nIf there is time, students may redesign apps for both characters.\n\n**Distribute**: Pass out crayons/pencils/etc. to each student as they open their reflection journals. \n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: “Share Out” slide\n\n**Share**: After designing, students share their app design with a neighbor, or if there is time, some students can share with the whole class.

(Three additional slides have been provided for this part of the activity if needed.)\n\n\n\n\nOnce the class has had some practice, you can encourage students to nest conditionals inside one another.

Ask the class what the bee should do if there's a flower. If there's not a flower, there will be a honeycomb.

        "description": "Now, imagine that this song is a computer program. Defining a title (like \"chorus\") for a little piece of code that you use over and over again is called creating a function. \n\nThis is helpful to computer scientists for some of the same reasons that it is helpful to songwriters. \n\n - It saves time not having to write all the code over and over in the program. \n - If you make a mistake, you only have to change it one place. \n - The program feels less complicated with the repeating pieces defined just once at the top.\n\nWe are going to play with songs a little more, to try to really understand how often this technique is used!"

All of a sudden, our chorus would be a function of repeated actions, rather than words.\r\n- Use the concepts of the arrows from the Graph Paper Programming lesson and create a program with lots of repeating instructions.\r\n\t- Circle those repeating actions so that the class can see where they are.\r\n\t- Define a function called \"Chorus\" above the program.\r\n\t- Cross out everywhere the repeating actions appear in the program and write \"Chorus\" instead.\r\n- Repeat until the class can go through this process with little direction."

In a function declaration, you fill in the function with code and you give the function a name. You must declare a function before you can use it.\n\n2. **The Call**:\n\tFunction calls are what makes the program run the code in the function. To call a function, you place the name of the function in your program. Make sure your function is properly defined before calling it in your program.\n    \nThe class can use songwriting as an example to understand these two components. In the unplugged activity, the function containing the lyrics to the chorus was named \"chorus\". When we first made this function, we circled the lyrics that would go in the function. Once we named the function, we could read through the lyrics and replace the repeated chorus lyrics with a function call to \"chorus\".\n\nContinue the conversation until students have a basic understanding of functions being declared and called. If students don't get to this point, make sure to do one of the bridging activities before moving into the Code.org puzzles."
