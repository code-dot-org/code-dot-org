Their clapping should continue until they are told to “stop clapping” even if they are given other new behaviors in between. \n\n*The leader can also call for the players to “stop everything”.* \n\nThis should result in everyone just standing at rest regardless of all previous commands.\n\nYou as the teacher should take on the role of the leader. You can try make up your own sequences, but here are some you can try. Be sure to give a little space between commands. For each of these sections, consider running through the entire sequence without any discussion and later repeating it again after everyone has had a chance to debrief and process any confusion.\n\n#### Round 1 (Basic):\n* Begin marching in place.\n* Stop marching in place.\n* Begin clapping.\n* Stop clapping.\n* Begin marching in place.\n* Begin clapping.\n* Stop everything.\n\n**Debrief:** *What happened when you were told to clap but you were already marching in place?

        "description": "\n####Ethical Sharing\n\n**Activity:** Have all of your students stand up. Begin reading the list of ways to create content below. Instruct students to sit down as soon as they can answer “Yes” to one of the prompts.\n\n- *Have you ever made a video (on a camera, phone, iPad, or computer) and sent it to a family member or posted it online?*\n- *Have you taken a photo and sent to a family member or posted it online?*\n- *Have you created a piece of art to share with your family and friends?*\n- *Have you made up a song to make your friends laugh? Or a sad song to make them cry?*\n- *Have you written a poem for your mom or dad on their birthday?*\n\nKeep asking similar questions until the entire class is seated.\n\n**Discuss:** \n\n- *How did it feel to produce something creative?*\n- *How did you feel when you were able to share your creation with others?*\n- *How do you feel when you view or listen to other people’s creations?*\n\nEncourage all responses.\n\nHelp students feel the joy of creating something. Creating can be a lot of hard work, but it is one of the most rewarding things we do. Sharing what we create is fun, and it can encourage more creativity and art. As we get older, we have more and more opportunities to share our work and explore media and art that other people have created. We want to make sure we are always fair when using others’ art and creative work.\n\n**Say:** _Remember, copyright protects all kinds of creative work so that artists/creators can get paid for their eﬀort. This includes, original writing (stories), art, photographs, audio, images, music, song lyrics, even the doodle you drew on your napkin at lunch. It doesn't matter if it was created by a famous artist or by you. When you make an original work, you get to decide who can:_ \n\n- *make copies* \n- *distribute copies*\n- *display or perform the work in public*\n- *make spin‐oﬀs; we call these derivatives (for example, like a book being made into a movie)* \n\n*These rights are given to artists and creators to encourage them to make even more creative work.*\n\n**Think:** Have students think back to the art creation prompt where they first sat down. Inform them that they created an original work with legal protection. Congratulations! \n\n**Pair:**  \n\n- *How might you know if something is copyrighted?* \n  -  The circle © indicates copyright, but copyright protection exists even without the symbol. Creators have ownership over their work, unless they sell it to someone else.\n- *Where have you seen the copyright symbol?* \n  - At the front of books, in movies, on images, posters, etc.\n\n**Share:** Encourage students to share their answers with the class.\n \n**Demonstrate:** Show students how to draw a copyright symbol and write the year next to it. When you make something creative like this, it’s automatically protected by copyright, even without the copyright symbol. \n\n**Discuss:** \n\n- *How does it feel when you share your things with someone else?* \n- *What does it feel like when someone takes your things and shares them without your permission?*\n\n*The same principles of respect and fairness apply when we share our work or someone else’s work online.*"

Is that OK?* \n    - If it’s a song you hear on the radio, it’s most likely protected by copyright and NOT OK to share, copy, and give away.\n- *What if your friend invites you to his house to watch a movie that just came out on DVD? This is one of your favorite movies. You want it on your phone, so you can watch it whenever you want. So, you take out your phone and record the movie. Is this a fair way to get a copy of the movie?* \n    - No. This is not OK to share/copy. Why? Because you don’t own the right to make a copy and give it away.\n    -  *How else could you get an authorized (legal) copy of the movie for your phone?* \n        -  iTunes or Amazon sell movies legally.\n\n### Okay to Share\n\n- *I made this. That means I own it. I think I’m going to share it. I’m going to take out my phone (iPad, camera, etc.) to get a picture. I think I want to share it on my blog where I might make some money advertising on[Use the site of your choice.] Is this fair?* \n     - Yes, this is OK to share because I made it — I own the copyright.\n- *What about a song I wrote? Can I share that? . . . Who gets to decide?* \n     - “That’s right, I do.”\n- *What will happen when I share it?* \n     - Take responses: “It’s fun, . . . I’ll get a bunch of ‘likes’ . . . People will want to use it for mashups.”\n- *Let’s say you draw a picture to sell at a school art show. The money from the art sale will go to buy new library books. Is this a good share . . . is it ethical?* \n     - *Yes.*\n     - *Why is this share OK?* \n         - Take responses: “It’s yours!”, “You made it. You own it. You can choose to share it.” \n\n"

Defining a title (like \"chorus\") for a little piece of code that you use over and over again is called creating a function. \n\nThis is helpful to computer scientists for some of the same reasons that it is helpful to songwriters. \n\n - It saves time not having to write all the code over and over in the program. \n - If you make a mistake, you only have to change it one place. \n - The program feels less complicated with the repeating pieces defined just once at the top.\n\nWe are going to play with songs a little more, to try to really understand how often this technique is used!"

All of a sudden, our chorus would be a function of repeated actions, rather than words.\r\n- Use the concepts of the arrows from the Graph Paper Programming lesson and create a program with lots of repeating instructions.\r\n\t- Circle those repeating actions so that the class can see where they are.\r\n\t- Define a function called \"Chorus\" above the program.\r\n\t- Cross out everywhere the repeating actions appear in the program and write \"Chorus\" instead.\r\n- Repeat until the class can go through this process with little direction."

        "description": "Ask the class to think back to \"Functions Unplugged: Songwriting\" and recall what a function is. Open a discussion about when to use a function when writing a song.\n\nTell the class that there are two main components to using functions.\n\n1. **The Declaration**: Function declarations are what create a function. In a function declaration, you fill in the function with code and you give the function a name. You must declare a function before you can use it.\n\n2. **The Call**:\n\tFunction calls are what makes the program run the code in the function. To call a function, you place the name of the function in your program. Make sure your function is properly defined before calling it in your program.\n    \nThe class can use songwriting as an example to understand these two components. In the unplugged activity, the function containing the lyrics to the chorus was named \"chorus\". When we first made this function, we circled the lyrics that would go in the function. Once we named the function, we could read through the lyrics and replace the repeated chorus lyrics with a function call to \"chorus\".\n\nContinue the conversation until students have a basic understanding of functions being declared and called. If students don't get to this point, make sure to do one of the bridging activities before moving into the Code.org puzzles.",

Code is used to create computer applications. Games, web browsers, media players... the list of applications goes on and on!*  \n- _App_ *is short for application. Usually, apps more specifically refer to applications running on small computers called* _mobile devices._\n- *Smartphones and tablets are examples of mobile devices.*\n\n**Discuss**: Apps are everywhere! Ask students why they think apps have become so popular. Here are some example explanations:\n\n- Many people can more easily access or afford a mobile device (e.g., smartphone) than a larger computer with a keyboard, mouse, and so forth. \n- Apps can address a variety of needs. For example, if I need a ride somewhere, I might try a ride-sharing app and get there quickly. If I want to know what movies I should watch, there's probably an app that can help me decide. And of course, if I want to call or text someone on my phone, I use apps for those as well! \n\nIntroduce accessibility with the remarks below.\n\n**Say**: \n\n- *As apps become used by more and more people, app developers often come across issues that they had not considered, likely because they have never experienced those issues in their own lives.*\n- *Many of these issues are related to _accessibility._ In the world of computer science, accessibility is about creating technology for people with _disabilities._* \n- *Disabilities include physical, auditory, visual, and many others.*\n- *Disabilities are diverse and impact people in different ways. For example, someone who is slightly visually impaired might wear glasses. Someone who is severely visually impaired might be considered \"blind\" and will need more assistance.* \n\n**Transition**: Tell students you'd like to introduce them to a few kids who are just like them even though they have disabilities.",

While displaying a scenario image, read its accompanying script to the class (see below). Discussion questions are included in relevant slides.\n\n[slides]\n\n#### Designing for Accessibility Scenarios\n\n*Slide 1: Meet Wei*\n\n* Wei is a talented kid who LOVES music. She plays piano and sings very well! \n* Wei is visually impaired. While she is not completely blind, it is very difficult for her to see things, even if they are near her eyes.\n* Wei has had to learn piano differently from kids who aren’t visually impaired, but that hasn’t stopped her from becoming a great musician! \n* Wei recently began creating her own music. She is very proud of it! She would like to record and share her music with her friends.\n\n*Slide 2: Introducing Grammaphone!*\n\n* Grammaphone is a popular new app that allows people to upload and share their own music with friends. \n* Here is a screenshot of the home screen. What do you think about it? How do you think this app works? \n\n*Slide 3: Wei’s Problem*\n\n* Wei needs to use Grammaphone to share her music. After all, it’s the most popular music-sharing app!\n* However, she’s having a difficult time using the app. Why do you think that is? \n\n*Slide 4: Meet Roger*\n\n* Roger is an energetic kid who loves video games! He especially likes playing sports games with his friends.\n* Things have been hard for Roger lately, though. A few years ago, Roger’s hand had to be “amputated” (surgically removed) due to an accident. \n* Thankfully, computer scientists, engineers, and doctors are working hard to provide Roger with a cool-looking robotic “prosthetic hand,” which will be awesome!\n* But for now, Roger wants to play sports video games with his friends! \n\n*Slide 5: Introducing Football Frenzy!*\n\n* Football Frenzy is a new mobile game that everyone loves!\n* It has cool graphics, awesome sound effects, tight controls, and amazing action!\n* Here’s a screenshot of the game in action. Based on the interface, how do you think this game is played? \n\n*Slide 6: Roger’s Problem*\n\n* All of Roger’s friends play Football Frenzy. It’s connected online so that you can play it anywhere!\n* Roger wants to play Football Frenzy with them, but he is having a difficult time. Why do you think that is?\n\n*Slide 7: I Wish...* \n\n* Neither of these apps was designed with people like Wei and Roger in mind.\n* When it comes to these apps, what specific features do you think Wei and Roger wish for? \n* Let’s make their wishes come true by redesigning these apps! \n\n[/slides]\n\n####App Redesign Activity (25 min)\n\nThe final scenario allows students to sketch a redesign of one app from the scenarios (\"Grammaphone\" for Wei or \"Football Frenzy\" for Roger). \n\nStudents should primarily focus their efforts on making their redesigned app more accessible for either of them, along with any other accessibility features they can think of. Students can design as many screens for the app as they wish, and they do not need to make their app look anything like the original examples.\n\nIf there is time, students may redesign apps for both characters.\n\n**Distribute**: Pass out crayons/pencils/etc. to each student as they open their reflection journals. \n\n**Share**: After designing, students share their app design with a neighbor, or if there is time, some students can share with the whole class. Each student should answer how their app design addresses the need of the user in question."
