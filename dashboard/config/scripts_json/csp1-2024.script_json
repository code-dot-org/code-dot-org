Students watch a brief video about computing innovations.  The lesson ends with students logging into the Code.org CSP course web site, and answering a brief prompt about what “computer science” means to them. This activity plants the initial seed for students to think about the ways in which they might be able to solve some problems relevant to their lives with technological innovations. ",

You might consider administering it on an admin day at school, or as an early homework.\n* Because it is a pre-course survey it is important that students take it as early in the course as possible, before they have had much (or any) exposure to the class so that we may accurately gauge changes in attitudes and beliefs caused by the course.\n\nThank you!\n\n-- The Code.org Team\n"

It is important to allow ample brainstorming time - students may generate familiar responses at first, but may stretch their thinking and get more creative with additional time.

After you finish each of the four parts of the Activity Guide, I want you to check your work with your partner. Feel free to use your Flippy Do as you work. <br><br>**Distribute:** Activity Guide <br><br>**Note:** Encourage students to use their Flippy Do as a resource. <br><br><ul><li> **Challenge 1 - All 4-bit Numbers:** Students should produce all binary numbers with a length of 4 bits, from 0000 to 1111. They should see that all odd numbers end in 1 and even numbers end in 0. Students may also notice that the binary digits increasingly “roll-over” to 1’s (from right to left) as numbers become larger and larger.</li><li> **Challenge 2 - Binary Numbers with Exactly One 1:**  The goal here is for students to systematically find all binary numbers that have all zeros, except for one bit. Students should notice that the resulting decimal values are all powers of 2.</li><li>**Challenge 3 - Conversion Practice:** This section gives students more practice converting between number bases. The last two decimal numbers, 256 and 513, are too big to represent using the Flippy Do, however students should make the connection that more bits could be added to the left of the Flippy Do using increasing powers of 2.</li><li> **Challenge 4 - Putting it all Together:**   The last four questions on the Activity Guide ask students to apply their understanding to new situations. The first two questions ask students to describe what happens to the value when 0’s are added to the left or right of a binary number. The last two questions ask students to think about how many bits are required to represent specific values in binary.</li></ul> <br><br> **Note:** As you circulate, take an opportunity to be a Lead Learner. Help students discover the items below using the suggested questions:<br><br><ul><li>**Reading a number vs. Placing a Number:** Do we fill in the places on the Flippy Do starting on the left or right? Does it matter? (Yes. If we have a 5-bit number, we actually use the 5 bits on the far right. If we were to use the bits on the far left, this changes the value of the number. This is similar to adding more zeros to a decimal number.)</li><li>**Highest value possible with a given number of bits:** What is the largest number we can make with 4 bits? Is the last number we can make always odd? (A meaningful pattern is that we can count as high as one less than the next bit on the left. If we have four bits, we can count up to the number 15, because the next bit has a value of 16.) </li><li>**Number of numbers we can make:** How many total unique numbers are possible with 4 bits? (This is a base 2 number system. With each new bit, we double the amount of unique numbers we can make. With four bits, we can make the decimal numbers 0 to 15 (0000 to 1111), for a total of 16 unique numbers.)</li></ul>   \n"

With ten digits on our hands and feet, the decimal (base 10) number base was natural for humans to develop.  The ten symbols we use for this number base are the digits 0-9.   For a computer, however, it makes more sense that data be represented in binary (base 2), as this can easily be interpreted with electrical switches set to two states: ON or OFF.  The two symbols we use for this number base are the digits 0 and 1.\r\n\r\nBoth number bases take advantage of the concept of place value.  In decimal, numbers are composed of powers of 10, increasing in value from right to left.  Binary is similar, however we use powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.).  Expressed in binary, these values are 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, and so on.  These make up the incremental place values in the binary number system.\r\n\r\n**Why Binary?**\r\n\r\nStudents will see in a later lesson how computers use binary numbers as a representation of electrical signals on a wire. The wire is always set to one of two different options: on or off. Off can be reprsented with a 0 and on with a 1. \r\n"

It's a term used to mean something with continuous representation - such as a picture you draw on a piece of paper. Each pencil line smoothly connects to the next, no matter how much you zoomed in on the picture with a magnifying glass. \r\n\r\nWhen we represent an analog image digitally, we will have to make some choices on how to sample the image to get the smoothest representation possible while keeping in mind the number of bits it takes to build that image. \r\n\r\nWhat does it mean to sample? We are choosing how small to make section of the picture we look at when deciding whether to make it black or white. The smaller the sample, the more pixels required to represent that image. Larger samples require less pixels, but the image can become blurry. \r\n\r\nTry it out yourself!",

We get a better approximation of the analog image when we do more frequent sampling and it was a little easier to decide whether each square should be set to black or white.  However, it took longer and we needed a lot more bits.  We still got an image that didn’t represent the image accurately enough, though.\r\n\r\nFortunately, a computer does this process much more quickly than we can, and it can store thousands or even millions of bits to represent an analog image.\r\n\r\nBy this point, we've used bits to represent numbers, text, and images.

An alternate strategy is: when students start for the second time, have them compete against themselves to beat their rating during the first 4 minutes. In this way, success is measured by personal growth and has a higher chance of letting every student feel successful.\n\n**Starting Over:** When solving computational problems, it can sometimes be helpful to restart completely from the beginning. This activity may be a good place to suggest this to students, especially those that feel particularly stuck or frustrated - sometimes restarting from the very beginning surfaces new ideas and strategies that we didn’t see before.\n"

These questions are mapped to topics with each topic having a handful of questions available.\n\nThe College Board has a few strict guidelines about how topic questions can be used. In particular, students may not receive a grade based on performance on topic questions nor can they be used for teacher evaluation. Beyond these requirements, however, they are primarily intended to formatively assess student progress and learning as they prepare for the end of course exam.\n\nWithin our own course we recommend that you use them in a variety of ways:\n\n* Throughout the unit assign topic questions to students related to the topics students are learning about that day or that week\n* Prior to the unit assessment assign topic questions to help students practice and prepare for the summative assessment\n* After the unit assessment use these topic questions to help students track their progress towards preparation for the AP assessment\n\n\n![](https://images.code.org/5e345a372dcfc1c8a51b8d3ab159238b-unit1didg.png)\n\nClick for more info: [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l9VDL92DCIbTNhTiLGIr-enBOTM4wEDTTQOBlJ7bBhM/edit?usp=share_link)"
