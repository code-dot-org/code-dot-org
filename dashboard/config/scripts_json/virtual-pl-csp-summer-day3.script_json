They look at the router logs again to notice that messages are being passed between routers in order to reach their destination.

There is a ‘Teacher View’ button you can use to see the username of who sent individual messages (see below)\r\n\r\n* Avoid Downtime: Unstructured time in the lesson can lead to off-task messages. As best as you can, try to keep the pace of the lesson moving so there is always something for students to do\r\n\r\n* Provide Specific Prompts: This lesson includes several specific types of messages for students to send.
