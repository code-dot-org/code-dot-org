Examples might include _hiding a diary_, _using a bike lock_, _keeping a toy in a safe place_, etc. Clarify that one of the ways people protect something is by restricting who can access it.\n\n**Ask**: _Let's think about when we use devices, like a phone or computer. How do you limit who can access something that you want to protect, and why would you limit access?_\n\nExamples might include password-protection, device-lock, fingerprint scanner, not letting others use the device.\n\n**Say**: _One of the most common ways to protect your devices and information online is by using a password. A **password** is a secret string of letters, symbols, and numbers that you can use to restrict who can access something digital. Some passwords, however, are stronger than others because they are harder for someone to figure out. Let's investigate why strong passwords are important and how you can make sure yours are strong._ ([Slide 5](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Pspz89jagbsbDvxndX0ULUKA9PikWMR3zpTSn8Cdjec/edit#slide=id.g3b037fe8d8_1_103))",

What is it supposed to do? What does it do? What does that tell you?\n - Remind frustrated students that frustration is a step on the path to learning, and that persistence will pay off.\n - If a student is still stuck after all of this, ask leading questions to get the student to spot an error on their own."

Instead of telling them \"no\", describe that you were feeling a little bit mad, a little bit sad, and a little bit confused.  When you put all of those emotions together, it makes a feeling called \"frustration\".  When you are \"frustrated\" you might think you are mad, sad, or confused -- and you might be tempted to give up -- but frustration is a natural feeling and it's a big hint that you are about to learn something!  Instead of quitting, practice persistence.  Keep trying over and over again.  After a few times, you will start to understand how to debug your problems!",

In this activity, students will read aloud instructions as they learn to code with events in Bounce to make a game. Once the game is complete, students will provide play-by-play commentary as their classmates predict which way the ball will bounce in order to score. Students will also complete a Frayer model about bar graphs prior to creating a scaled bar graph using the data collected during their game.\n\n*Standards Addressed:*\n\n- **CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RF.3.4:** Read with sufficient accuracy and fluency to support comprehension.\n\n- **CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.SL.3.4:** Report on a topic or text, tell a story, or recount an experience with appropriate facts and relevant, descriptive details, speaking clearly at an understandable pace.\n\n- **CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.3.MD.B.3:** Draw a scaled picture graph and a scaled bar graph to represent a data set with several categories. Solve one- and two-step \"how many more\" and \"how many less\" problems using information presented in scaled bar graphs. \n\n- **NGSS.3-PS2-2:** Make observations and/or measurements of an object’s motion to provide evidence that a pattern can be used to predict future motion. \n\n"

Other dancers have a default size of 100.\n\n##### Level 12\n\n* As with the previous level, make sure to only use the `set tint to (color)` block after you have made the dancers in your program. For example, placing it as the first step in the `setup` area of your program will have no effect.\n\n##### Level 13\n\n* With the right code, you should see the dancer cycle through different colors, sizes, or dance moves.\n* Make sure there is a teal `change`, a teal `randomize` block, or a purple `do forever` block connected inside the `every 2 measures` block. \n* Make sure `do forever` blocks are set to either (Next), (Previous), or (Random). Otherwise, the dancer will just perform the set move repeatedly.\n* Note that the **code students write in this level is not checked for correctness**. This means they will always pass the level, even if they do not change the program. Students should feel free to experiment with their code in ways that are interesting to them. Click the “Finish” button to move on.\n* Making new dancers inside the `every 2 measures` block will cause your program to create multiple identical dancers at the same location(s) and may lead to unintended consequences!\n",

During online activities, the role of the teacher is primarily one of encouragement and support. Online lessons are meant to be student-centered, so teachers should avoid stepping in when students get stuck. Some ideas on how to do this are: \n\n - Utilize ***Pause and Think Online** Video whenever possible.\n - Encourage students with questions/challenges to start by asking their partner.\n - Unanswered questions can be escalated to a nearby group, who might already know the solution.\n - Remind students to use the debugging process before you approach.\n - Have students describe the problem that they’re seeing. What is it supposed to do? What does it do? What does that tell you?\n - Remind frustrated students that frustration is a step on the path to learning, and that persistence will pay off.\n - If a student is still stuck after all of this, ask leading questions to get the student to spot an error on their own."

You can write the program as an algorithm, pseudocode, or actual code.\n\nHere is a sample algorithm:\n\n\tif (CARD is RED)\n\t\tAward YOUR team 1 point\n\t\n\tElse\n\t\tAward OTHER team 1 point\n\n\nHere is a sample of the same program in pseudocode:\n\n\n\tIf (card.color == RED){\n\t\tpoints.yours = points.yours + 1;\n\t}\n\t\n\tElse {\n\t\tpoints.other = points.other + 1;\n\t}\n\n\n- Decide how you want to split your class into teams.\n- Each team should have a pile of cards (at least as many cards as team members) nearby.\n- Put one of your “Programs” up on the board for all to see.\n- Have the teams take turns drawing cards and following the program to see how many points they score in each round.\n- Play several times with several different programs to help the students really understand conditionals.\n\n\nOnce the class has had some practice, you can encourage students to nest conditionals inside one another. Make sure they understand that if the card is red, YOUR team is awarded 1 point, and then _nothing else happens_, since the condition was met:\n\n\n\tIf (CARD is RED)\n\t\tAward YOUR team 1 point\n\t\n\tElse\n\t\tIf (CARD is higher than 9)\n\t\t\tAward OTHER team 1 point\n\t\tElse\n\t\t\tAward YOUR team the same number of points on the card\n\n\n\nHere is the same program in pseudocode:\n\n\tIf (card.color == RED ){\n\t\tpoints.yours = points.yours + 1;\n\t}\n\tElse {\n\t\tif (card.value > 9){\n\t\t\tpoints.other = points.other + 1;\n\t\t}\n\t\tElse {\n\t\t\tpoints.yours = points.yours + card.value;\n\t\t}\n\t}"

Students will use a deck of playing cards to review basic multiplication and division problems as you apply the computer science concept of conditionals.\n\n*Standards Addressed:*\n\n- **CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.SL.3.3:** Ask and answer questions about information from a speaker, offering appropriate elaboration and detail.\n\n- **CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.3.OA.C.7:** Fluently multiply and divide within 100, using strategies such as the relationship between multiplication and division (e.g., knowing that 8 × 5 = 40, one knows 40 ÷ 5 = 8) or properties of operations. By the end of Grade 3, know from memory all products of two one-digit numbers.\n\n"

It might be helpful to translate the task into instructions like: \n\n* while there is a path ahead  \n     * walk forward\n     * if there is a chair, step over it\n* sit down\n\nTell students they will be using conditionals during this lesson. Give the definition of:\n\n - **Condition**: A statement that a program checks to see if it is true or false. If true, an action is taken. Otherwise, the action is ignored.\n - **Conditionals**: Statements that only run under certain conditions.\n\nOpen up a discussion of when you might use a conditional in your code.",

If you were to say *\"while there is a hole, fill it with dirt\"* what would they do? How long would they do that?\n\nWhen you use a word like “while”, you are relying on a condition to tell the computer how long the loop should run. A condition is a statement that is tested and found to be true or false. In the case above, the condition is if there is a hole. It’s only possible for there to be a hole or for there not to be a hole, thus the statement is only ever true or false.\n\nTell the students they will be learning about a new kind of loop. Previously, students only used loops to repeat a command a certain number of times. Here, they won't always know how many times to repeat the command, however, they will know when to stop or when to keep going. While loops allow the programmer to repeat a command as long as a condition is still true. In the previous example, the condition is the existence of a hole.\n\nIf there's time, have the students discuss other times using a while loop would be useful. Examples include:\n\n - Running toward a ball while it is in front of you.\n - Filling a glass while it has space for more liquid.\n - Walk forward while there is a path ahead.",

As they do so, have them touch on what the planning-to-coding experience was like for them, including ideas they'd still like to implement. \n* **Pair Playtesting**: Have students or groups pair up and playtest each other's projects. As they do, ask them to provide positive and constructive feedback to each other. The benefit here is that students will have the opportunity to provide and respond to feedback in a smaller setting. \n* **Gallery Walk**: Ensure all students have their projects ready for testing. Have students move \"musical chairs\"-style to another computer and play/test the project there for a few minutes, until they receive a signal from you to move to another computer.
