This will help introduce key concepts of this lesson.

Examples might include _hiding a diary_, _using a bike lock_, _keeping a toy in a safe place_, etc. Clarify that one of the ways people protect something is by restricting who can access it.\n\n**Ask**: _Let's think about when we use devices, like a phone or computer. How do you limit who can access something that you want to protect, and why would you limit access?_\n\nExamples might include password-protection, device-lock, fingerprint scanner, not letting others use the device.\n\n**Say**: _One of the most common ways to protect your devices and information online is by using a password. A **password** is a secret string of letters, symbols, and numbers that you can use to restrict who can access something digital. Some passwords, however, are stronger than others because they are harder for someone to figure out. Let's investigate why strong passwords are important and how you can make sure yours are strong._ ([Slide 5](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Pspz89jagbsbDvxndX0ULUKA9PikWMR3zpTSn8Cdjec/edit#slide=id.g3b037fe8d8_1_103))",

Take turns sharing your idea with your partner._ Allow one minute to pair-share.\n\nInvite students to share out their answers. If necessary, prompt students to refer directly to the scenarios and to the consequences that would happen if someone's password was compromised.

During online activities, the role of the teacher is primarily one of encouragement and support. Online lessons are meant to be student-centered, so teachers should avoid stepping in when students get stuck. Some ideas on how to do this are: \n\n - Utilize Pair Programming whenever possible during the activity.\n - Encourage students with questions/challenges to start by asking their partner.\n - Unanswered questions can be escalated to a nearby group, who might already know the solution.\n - Have students describe the problem that they’re seeing. What is it supposed to do? What does it do? What does that tell you?\n - Remind frustrated students that frustration is a step on the path to learning, and that persistence will pay off.\n - If a student is still stuck after all of this, ask leading questions to get the student to spot an error on their own."

In this activity, students will read aloud instructions as they learn to code with events in Bounce to make a game. Once the game is complete, students will provide play-by-play commentary as their classmates predict which way the ball will bounce in order to score. Students will also complete a Frayer model about bar graphs prior to creating a scaled bar graph using the data collected during their game.\n\n*Standards Addressed:*\n\n- **CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RF.3.4:** Read with sufficient accuracy and fluency to support comprehension.\n\n- **CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.SL.3.4:** Report on a topic or text, tell a story, or recount an experience with appropriate facts and relevant, descriptive details, speaking clearly at an understandable pace.\n\n- **CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.3.MD.B.3:** Draw a scaled picture graph and a scaled bar graph to represent a data set with several categories. Solve one- and two-step \"how many more\" and \"how many less\" problems using information presented in scaled bar graphs. \n\n- **NGSS.3-PS2-2:** Make observations and/or measurements of an object’s motion to provide evidence that a pattern can be used to predict future motion. \n\n"

To solve this puzzle, place a `set size` block anywhere in your program and use it to change the size of some of your dancers. \n* Dancers created as a group have a default size of 30. Other dancers have a default size of 100.\n\n##### Level 12\n\n* As with the previous level, make sure to only use the `set tint to (color)` block after you have made the dancers in your program. For example, placing it as the first step in the `setup` area of your program will have no effect.\n\n##### Level 13\n\n* With the right code, you should see the dancer cycle through different colors, sizes, or dance moves.\n* Make sure there is a teal `change`, a teal `randomize` block, or a purple `do forever` block connected inside the `every 2 measures` block. \n* Make sure `do forever` blocks are set to either (Next), (Previous), or (Random). Otherwise, the dancer will just perform the set move repeatedly.\n* Note that the **code students write in this level is not checked for correctness**. This means they will always pass the level, even if they do not change the program. Students should feel free to experiment with their code in ways that are interesting to them. Click the “Finish” button to move on.\n* Making new dancers inside the `every 2 measures` block will cause your program to create multiple identical dancers at the same location(s) and may lead to unintended consequences!\n",

During online activities, the role of the teacher is primarily one of encouragement and support. Online lessons are meant to be student-centered, so teachers should avoid stepping in when students get stuck. Some ideas on how to do this are: \n\n - Utilize ***Pause and Think Online** Video whenever possible.\n - Encourage students with questions/challenges to start by asking their partner.\n - Unanswered questions can be escalated to a nearby group, who might already know the solution.\n - Remind students to use the debugging process before you approach.\n - Have students describe the problem that they’re seeing. What is it supposed to do? What does it do? What does that tell you?\n - Remind frustrated students that frustration is a step on the path to learning, and that persistence will pay off.\n - If a student is still stuck after all of this, ask leading questions to get the student to spot an error on their own."

(Three additional slides have been provided for this part of the activity if needed.)\n\n\n\n\nOnce the class has had some practice, you can encourage students to nest conditionals inside one another. Make sure they understand that if the card is red, YOUR team is awarded 1 point, and then _nothing else happens_, since the condition was met:\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: Show \"Let's nest conditionals” slide\n\n\n\n\tIf (CARD is RED)\n\t\tAward YOUR team 1 point\n\t\n\tElse\n\t\tIf (CARD is higher than 9)\n\t\t\tAward OTHER team 1 point\n\t\tElse\n\t\t\tAward YOUR team the same number of points on the card\n\n\n\nHere is the same program in pseudocode:\n\n\tIf (card.color == RED ){\n\t\tpoints.yours = points.yours + 1;\n\t}\n\tElse {\n\t\tif (card.value > 9){\n\t\t\tpoints.other = points.other + 1;\n\t\t}\n\t\tElse {\n\t\t\tpoints.yours = points.yours + card.value;\n\t\t}\n\t}"

A condition is a statement that is tested and found to be true or false. In the case above, the condition is if there is a hole. It’s only possible for there to be a hole or for there not to be a hole, thus the statement is only ever true or false.\n\nTell the students they will be learning about a new kind of loop. Previously, students only used loops to repeat a command a certain number of times. Here, they won't always know how many times to repeat the command, however, they will know when to stop or when to keep going. While loops allow the programmer to repeat a command as long as a condition is still true. In the previous example, the condition is the existence of a hole.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: Show the next slide\n\n**Say:** _Here are some times using a while loop would be useful:_\n\n\n - _Running toward a ball while it is in front of you._\n - _Filling a glass while it has space for more liquid._\n - _Walk forward while there is a path ahead._\n\n _Can you think of some others?_",

As they do so, have them touch on what the planning-to-coding experience was like for them, including ideas they'd still like to implement. \n* **Pair Playtesting**: Have students or groups pair up and playtest each other's projects. As they do, ask them to provide positive and constructive feedback to each other. The benefit here is that students will have the opportunity to provide and respond to feedback in a smaller setting. \n* **Gallery Walk**: Ensure all students have their projects ready for testing. Have students move \"musical chairs\"-style to another computer and play/test the project there for a few minutes, until they receive a signal from you to move to another computer. Repeat this every few minutes. While there is less opportunity for structured communication here, this ensures students get to demo as many of their peers' projects as possible.",
