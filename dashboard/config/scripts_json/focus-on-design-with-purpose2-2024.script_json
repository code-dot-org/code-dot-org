Student responses may vary but may include the following strategies:\n* Scan each row from left to right followed by scanning each column from top to bottom.\n* Check surrounding letters. Once you found the first letter or a key letter in a word you’re searching for, check the letters around it to see if you should keep going. For example, if you have a word with Q in it, if there’s no U next to it, then you need to keep searching.\n* Look for words that have less-common letters in them such as words with a Q, X, J, or Z\n* Look for words with letter pairs, such as double letters or QU\n* Look for more than one word at a time.\n* Turn the puzzle upside down"

Talking about the organization, structure, or role of the content in the page (heading, paragraph, list, etc.) is more accurate than talking about specific aspects of its appearance (such as size or spacing).\n\nFor the second prompt, there's a direct answer: the paragraph tag separates text into paragraphs. You may want to follow up this question by asking students how they think a web browser for the blind might deal with paragraphs. For example, while sighted people may use spacing and new lines to separate out paragraphs, what should a screen reader do?\n\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Key Vocabulary:**\n\n- HTML - Hypertext Markup Language, a language used to create web pages\n- HTML Element - A piece of a website, marked by a start tag and often closed with an end tag\n- HTML Tag - The special set of characters that indicates the start and end of an HTML element and that element's type\n",

What do you wonder* to guide your discussion, making sure to cover the following key points:\n\n* To make an HTML list, they need both tags - the first tag indicating the **type** of list they want and the second tag indicating a list item.\n* The structure of the HTML list element is unlike other HTML elements they have used so far since there is no content that goes right next to the start `<ul>` or `<ol>` tag.\n* We use indentation, or *whitespace*, in front of the `<li>` tags to indicate that they are \"children\" nested within the type of list tag.  \n* Once they have finished listing their items using the `<li>` tag, that is when they will finally use the closing `</ul>` or `</ol>` tag.\n* If they want their list to have a title, they need to use one of the heading tags they just learned about.

Depending on the difficulty level and time constraints, there are two project guide options to choose from. \n\n**Project Guide #1:** This version has detailed user descriptions with the potential topic headings already underlined and information they should include already highlighted for them. The students can look over what has been underlined and highlighted and make their design layout from there. Choose this option if your time is limited or if you have students who might need more support.  \n\n**Project Guide #2:** This version has detailed user descriptions with the first three potential topic headings already underlined as a starting point for the students. The remaining topic headings and the information that should be included for each topic are left up to the student to decide as the web developer. Choose this option if you have at least 2 days (1 day for planning and design and 1 day for building the webpage) or if your students would benefit from the extra challenge and web developer experience. \n\nMake sure you select the HTML Web Page Project Guide that corresponds to the option you choose.

This helps students prepare and communicate their issue before asking for help.\n- If students haven't seen it yet, consider showing the [Debugging Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auv10y-dN4s) to the class to reinforce debugging best practices.\n\n**Digging Deeper:** Consider supplying students with an object to talk to as part of the debugging process.

So, for example, the structure could include different headings and paragraphs but would say nothing about the color of text or how big it is displayed. The style of the page is the specifics of its appearance. Without a particular style, each web browser would decide how to display different web page elements on its own.\n\nStyles are important to allow web developers to decide exactly how a web page looks on the screen. Because styles are separate from structure and content, web developers can change the style of an entire page very easily, without having to make any changes to the structure and content of the web page. This means that it's very easy for web pages to have an individual look and feel that is unified across the entire page.\n\n**Circulate:** Support students as they continue through the first set of skill building levels."

This helps students prepare and communicate their issue before asking for help.\n- If students haven't seen it yet, consider showing the [Debugging Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auv10y-dN4s) to the class to reinforce debugging best practices.\n\n**Digging Deeper:** Consider supplying students with an object to talk to as part of the debugging process.

The discussion should solidify their grasp of properties like `flex-direction`, `flex-wrap`, `justify-content`, and `align-content`.\n\nAs you go over student predictions for part 2, ask students about the reasons behind their predictions. Hearing different perspectives deepens understanding and promotes a collaborative learning atmosphere. This will also help foster an environment where students critically analyze why certain properties result in specific layout changes, reinforcing their knowledge and developing their problem-solving skills. \n\nIf you have time, you can expand on what each child property does as you go over the answers to part 2.\n\nIf any students have incorrect answers from part 1 or part 2, offer a clear explanation or analogy to help the student understand why their answer was incorrect and how the correct property works. For example, “Think of  justify-content like when you are figuring out the spacing for posters across your bedroom wall and align-items like figuring out if you want them close to your ceiling, in the center of your wall or close to the floor” or “Think of order like a VIP getting to skip everyone else in line and move to the front.” Reinforce that making mistakes is a natural and valuable part of the learning process.

Some possible discoveries might include:\n* `flex-grow` seems to increase the size of an element\n* `flex-shrink` appears to decrease the size of an element\n* `order` rearranged the items\n   * Students may also wonder why a `-1` put the item at the front while a `1` put the item at the end. This is because the default order value of all items is 0. A negative number will put that to the left of items with a \"0\" value and an item with an order value greater than 0 will be placed to the right of items with a 0 value. This information is already noted in their Cheat Sheet but it may be helpful for students to highlight or circle the information.\n* `align-self` changes the vertical alignment for that one item"

Adding Flexbox concepts to an already created web page can often require the web developer to shift and move around the HTML content for the page to look as expected. As a result, this project has 3 options for you to choose from depending on the difficulty level and time constraints. \n\n**Option 1 - Easy:** Students add classes and flexbox to web page content that is already organized with `<div>` elements. Choose this option if you don’t have time available to allow your students to either alter the code that will be brought over from the Lesson 10 mini-project or build a new web page for a new user from scratch.\n\n**Option 2 - Intermediate:** Students add `div` tags, classes, and Flexbox to the webpage they styled for Lesson 10. Choose this option if your students are up for the challenge and you have the extra time (_possibly 2 days_) to allow students to shift their HTML code, iterating on their HTML to make their page look as their user requests.\n\n**Option 3 - Challenging:** Students create a webpage for a new user from scratch. Choose this option if you have at least 2-3 days to dedicate to this project and would like students to have the experience of building a webpage from beginning to end without breaks in between the process.\n\n**Select the Chapter Project Guide, Scoring Rubric, and Presentation Slides corresponding to your chosen option.**\n",

To help smooth out the debugging experience, consider the following strategies:\n\n- Review the [Teacher Guide to Debugging](https://docs.google.com/document/d/145lvpomqz0tUuzXLbkAFgP9zMDpECMwFYiEIG1_hQFg/view) for some common questions and strategies to help support students in debugging their code\n- Have students follow the steps in the [Student Guide to Debugging](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wNwoKDyoUas5GGkhqGmNN1u0XGQEdeOMWhSziyYIf8o/edit#) and use the [Bug Report Quarter-Sheets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M6mnq73DfyvzasucVAwfL-gjl2JqVPzjy_fRx5j4j7c/preview) as an initial step in the debugging process. This helps students prepare and communicate their issue before asking for help.\n- If students haven't seen it yet, consider showing the [Debugging Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auv10y-dN4s) to the class to reinforce debugging best practices.\n\n**Digging Deeper:** Consider supplying students with an object to talk to as part of the debugging process. This is sometimes known as Rubber Duck Debugging - you can learn more on the website https://rubberduckdebugging.com/"
