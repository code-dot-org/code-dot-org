Students may not notice this initially, but help them to describe the rhombus in terms of rows of rhombuses - for example, the bottom tip of the star is a single rhombus, then a row of 2 rhombuses, continuing for a total of 5 rows that get wider and then smaller again.\n"

Ask a student to click on a green bubble to show off what they created.\n\nFor the times when a student feels stuck:\n- **Collaborate with Neighbors**: Encourage students to check in with a neighbor when they're getting stuck. Depending on the age and ability of your students, you might consider formally breaking your class into pairs to complete the tutorial using pair programming. Watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxToW3ixrwo\" target=\"_blank\">this video</a> and visit this <a href=\"https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/115002122788-How-does-pair-programming-on-Code-org-work-\" target=\"_blank\">Support Page</a> for more information about pair programming.\n\n- **Read the Instructions**: The instructions are bulleted points on how to complete the level. If a student feels stuck, ask them to read the instructions out loud to you and ask them to repeat back what the instructions say in their own words. The instructions usually provide helpful tips on how to complete the level. Before giving students the answer, ensure they've carefully looked at the instructions, hints, videos, and any starter code carefully.\n- <img src=\"https://images.code.org/5b99c663ad6632fe64c9da69d6805c2b-text-to-speech.PNG\" style=\"height: 25px;\"> **Text to Speech:** Students can also click on this text-to-speech icon to hear the instructions read aloud.\n- <img src=\"https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/hint.png\" style=\"height: 35px;\"> **Look for hints**: Most levels include at least one hint with more explicit details about how to pass the level.\n- **Celebrate bugs**: Getting a bug in your code is a natural part of the coding process. If the program isn’t doing what they expected, ask the student to first tell you what they want to happen, click run to observe what is actually happening, then find the place in their code that caused the discrepancy.

It is a very simple shape that looks like an asterisk. Students will draw a rhombus, then turn the artist and draw another rhombus. Then they learn how to loop the Artist to repeat a chunk of the code. \n\n- **Level 2**: Show students how to drag & drop. Explain that the blocks are like puzzle pieces that must fit together to run. Students may select which color rhombus to use. When finished, students can test their code by pressing “Run.”\n\n- **Level 3**: The Artist must turn 60 degrees before stamping the next rhombus. Show students how to use the angle menu to modify the measurement. Explain to students that 60 degrees is the measure of the angle of the rhombus. Students may start anticipating the next lines of code, prompt them to look for patterns.\n\n- **Level 4**: Students will need to repeat the code until they have a 6 point star. This includes turning and stamping the rhombus. Prompt students to notice the patterns in the code.\n",

        "description": "**Overview**:  In the first few levels of this lesson, students will be programming just one point of their Star Quilt. Students will add rhombuses row by row. There are a lot of rhombuses to keep track of so students will use `comment` blocks to organize their code. Students will be using functions like `diagonalLeft`, `diagonalRight`, `bumpLeft`, and `bumpRight` to make the Artist jump to the correct position to start drawing a new rhombus. \n\n**Debugging Tips**:\n\n**Level 1**: This level is just to get the project set up. Remind students that their code will carry over from level to level so they can keep building their project from where they left off. \n\n**Level 2**: Remind students of the work they did in Lesson 2. Remind students of the importance of using the `comment` blocks to stay organized. Click on the lightbulb next to the Artist icon to see what the code should look like. \n\n**Level 3**: Here is where students will try out the new function blocks `diagonalRight` and `bumpLeft`. Help students understand what it is that these functions do. `diagonalRight` makes the artist jump diagonally to the right of the rhombus he just drew. `bumpLeft` makes the Artist jump left to set up for the next rhombus. Because this is Row 2 and the point is widening, the Artist will need to stamp two rhombuses.\n\n**Level 4**: In Row 3 the point is still widening, this time the Artist should stamp three rhombuses. There are two new functions. `diagonalLeft` makes the artist jump diagonally to the left of the rhombus he just drew. `bumpRight` makes the Artist jump right to set up for the next rhombus. \n\n**Level 5**: In Row 4 the point is starting to taper in, so the Artist should only stamp two rhombuses.\n\n**Level 6**: There is only one rhombus in Row 5. Students are done creating their point! Early finishers can experiment with colors and can start anticipating how to create the full Star Quilt.",
