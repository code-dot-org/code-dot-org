What do you suppose the process would be like for me to send a message to request that page?_\n\t- _What do I do as a user?_\n\t- _What do you think happens inside the internet?_\n\nSending a message over the internet is a lot like sending a message through the mail...if every letter we sent required thousands of envelopes!\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** Show “Packets” slide\n\nEvery message we send through the internet gets chopped up and each piece is wrapped in its own version of an envelope. We call those packets. Packets are specially formed chunks of information that are able to easily flow through any of the internet's channels.\n\nSometimes, a few of those packets will get lost, because the internet is a crazy place. In that case, the packets need to be resent, and the whole message has to get put on hold until they arrive.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** Show “Servers” slide\n\n_Where do you think those packets are headed?_\n\n- Even if you're sending messages to another person, they first have to go to at least one server.\n\t- A server is a special computer that is supposed to be always on and ready to send and receive information.\n\t- Every website has a server.\n\t- Even email goes through servers.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** Show “IP Addresses” slide \n\nServers don't have names like you and I do. They're actually addressed using numbers. These numbers are called IP addresses, and they look a little strange.\n\n- For example: One of Code.org's IP addresses used to be 54.243.71.82\n\t- (Please be sure to check this out in advance. Most IP addresses change from time to time and they are then reused for other sites.)\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** Show “DSL, Cable, Fiber Optic, or WiFi” slide\n\nThere are many ways to reach the internet from your house, school, or place of business.\n\n- You can connect directly using a cable (that might be DSL, Cable, or Fiber Optic)\n- Or you can connect using radio waves over the air through Wi-Fi.\n\nDirect connections are most reliable, but they can be inconvenient.\n\n- *Can you figure out why?*\n\t- (You have to be attached to a cable!)\n\nWi-Fi connections are super convenient, but the aren't always reliable.\n\n- *Can you figure out why not?*\n\t- (Radio waves bounce all over the place and can get lost.)"

Students will identify various values for the variables found in food chains (Example: plants, animals, decomposer, etc.) as they document these values on notecards and show the movement of matter through an environment. Students will also learn about the 10% Rule and further describe energy flow with a writing prompt.\n\n*Standards Addressed:*\n * **CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.W.5.2.B:** Develop the topic with facts, definitions, concrete details, quotations, or other information and examples related to the topic.\n\n* **CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.5.NF.B.7.C:** Solve real world problems involving division of unit fractions by non-zero whole numbers and division of whole numbers by unit fractions, e.g., by using visual fraction models and equations to represent the problem. \n\n* **NGSS.5-LS2-1:** Develop a model to describe the movement of matter among plants, animals, decomposers, and the environment. \n"

As they do, ask them to provide positive and constructive feedback to each other. The benefit here is that students will have the opportunity to provide and respond to feedback in a smaller setting.\n- **Gallery Walk:**  Ensure all students have their projects ready for testing. Have students move \"musical chairs\"-style to another computer and play/test the project there for a few minutes, until they receive a signal from you to move to another computer. Repeat this every few minutes. While there is less opportunity for structured communication here, this ensures students get to demo as many of their peers' projects as possible.\n",

She plays piano and sings very well! \n* Wei is visually impaired. While she is not completely blind, it is very difficult for her to see things, even if they are near her eyes.\n* Wei has had to learn piano differently from kids who aren’t visually impaired, but that hasn’t stopped her from becoming a great musician! \n* Wei recently began creating her own music. She is very proud of it! She would like to record and share her music with her friends.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** Show \"Introducing Grammaphone!\" slide\n\n* Grammaphone is a popular new app that allows people to upload and share their own music with friends. \n\n**Discuss**: What do you think about this app? How do you think this app works?\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** Show \"Wei and Grammaphone\" slide\n\n* Wei needs to use Grammaphone to share her music. After all, it’s the most popular music-sharing app!\n* However, she’s having a difficult time using the app. Why do you think that is? \n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** Show \"Meet Roger\" slide\n\n* Roger is an energetic kid who loves video games! He especially likes playing sports games with his friends.\n* Things have been hard for Roger lately, though. A few years ago, Roger’s hand had to be “amputated” (surgically removed) due to an accident. \n* Thankfully, computer scientists, engineers, and doctors are working hard to provide Roger with a cool-looking robotic “prosthetic hand,” which will be awesome!\n* But for now, Roger wants to play sports video games with his friends! \n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** Show \"Introducing Football Frenzy!\" slide\n\n* Football Frenzy is a new mobile game that everyone loves!\n* It has cool graphics, awesome sound effects, tight controls, and amazing action!\n\n**Discuss**: What do you think about this app? How do you think this game is played?\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** Show \"Roger and Football Frenzy\" slide\n\n* All of Roger’s friends play Football Frenzy.

Why do you think that is?\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** Show \"Designing for Accessibility\" slide\n\n* Neither of these apps was designed with people like Wei and Roger in mind.\n* When it comes to these apps, what specific features do you think Wei and Roger wish for? \n* Let’s redesign these apps! \n\n####App Redesign Activity (25 min)\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: “Your turn!” slide\n\nThe final scenario allows students to sketch a redesign of one app from the scenarios (\"Grammaphone\" for Wei or \"Football Frenzy\" for Roger). \n\nStudents should primarily focus their efforts on making their redesigned app more accessible for either of them, along with any other accessibility features they can think of. Students can design as many screens for the app as they wish, and they do not need to make their app look anything like the original examples.\n\nIf there is time, students may redesign apps for both characters.\n\n**Distribute**: Pass out crayons/pencils/etc. to each student as they open their reflection journals. \n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: “Share Out” slide\n\n**Share**: After designing, students share their app design with a neighbor, or if there is time, some students can share with the whole class.

Instruct students to sit down as soon as they can answer “Yes” to one of the prompts.\n\n- *Have you ever made a video (on a camera, phone, iPad, or computer) and sent it to a family member or posted it online?*\n- *Have you taken a photo and sent it to a family member or posted it online?*\n- *Have you created a piece of art to share with your family and friends?*\n- *Have you made up a song to make your friends laugh?

Creating can be a lot of hard work, but it is one of the most rewarding things we do. Sharing what we create is fun, and it can encourage more creativity and art. As we get older, we have more and more opportunities to share our work and explore media and art that other people have created. We want to make sure we are always fair when using others’ art and creative work.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: Show “Copyright” slide\n\n**Say:** _Remember, copyright protects all kinds of creative work so that artists/creators can get paid for their eﬀort. This includes, original writing (stories), art, photographs, audio, images, music, song lyrics, even the doodle you drew on your napkin at lunch. It doesn't matter if it was created by a famous artist or by you. When you make an original work, you get to decide who can:_ \n\n- *make copies* \n- *distribute copies*\n- *display or perform the work in public*\n- *make spin‐oﬀs; we call these derivatives (for example, like a book being made into a movie)* \n\n*These rights are given to artists and creators to encourage them to make even more creative work.*\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: Show “Think-Pair-Share” slide\n\n**Think:** Have students think back to the character sketch they created at the beginning of class. Inform them that they created an original work with legal protection. Congratulations! \n\n**Pair:**  \n\n- *How might you know if something is copyrighted?* \n  -  The circle © indicates copyright, but copyright protection exists even without the symbol. Creators have ownership over their work, unless they sell it to someone else.\n- *Where have you seen the copyright symbol?* \n  - At the front of books, in movies, on images, posters, etc.\n\n**Share:** Encourage students to share their answers with the class.\n \n**Demonstrate:** Show students how to draw a copyright symbol and write the year next to it. When you make something creative like this, it’s automatically protected by copyright, even without the copyright symbol. \n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: Show “Discuss” slide\n\n**Discuss:** \n\n- *How does it feel when you share your things with someone else?* \n- *What does it feel like when someone takes your things and shares them without your permission?*\n\n**Say**: *The same principles of respect and fairness apply when we share our work or someone else’s work online.*"
