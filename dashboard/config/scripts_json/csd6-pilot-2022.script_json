How is computer technology changing this field, what are some of the problems that people are trying to solve with technology?\r\n    * Second, identify a handful of innovative devices within this topic. Students should focus on finding _hardware_ devices that demonstrate unique or novel _form factors_. That is to say, computers that don't _look_ like computers.\r\n* **Send to Code Studio for resource links**: On Code Studio we have compiled more detailed descriptions of the topics as well as couple of recommended sites to learn more about each topic. Use this as a jumping off point for student research."

        "description": "#### An Innovative Solution\r\n\r\nOnce groups have selected a specific innovative device, they can complete the second page of this activity guide, which asks them to do the following:\r\n\r\n* **What Problem Does It Solve?:** For some topics this may be more clear (for example healthcare devices typically have a very specific goal), but for others students may need to think more broadly about what they consider problems. More frivolous wearables or digital art installations may be more concerned with personal expression than solving a specific problem.\r\n* **What Is Innovative About It?:** Encourage students to refer back to the earlier discussion about innovation for this. It can also be useful to compare against other devices found during the research phase.\r\n* **How Do You Interact With It?:** Ask students to think back to the _Input, Output, Storage, Processing_ model that was introduced way back in Unit 1. The goal here is to identify specifically the Inputs and Outputs provided by a given device - the more specific these are, the more easily students will be able to connect elements of the Circuit Playground to these devices.\r\n* **How Could You Improve It?:** Feel free to make this as realistic or aspirational as you like. The goal here is just to get students thinking about how they might develop an innovation of their own by using an existing product as a jumping off point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Share:** Give groups a minute each to share their findings. See the extension activities for alternate ways to share."
