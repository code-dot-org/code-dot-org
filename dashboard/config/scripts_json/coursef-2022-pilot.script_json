        "preparation": " - Spend time making your own project with both the Artist and Sprite Lab. Familiarize yourself with the capabilities and limitations of each tool.\r\n - Modify the rubric to fit your class goals and print out a copy for each student.\r\n - Modify the project design worksheet to fit your class and print one packet for each student.",
        "purpose": "Students may be ready to jump straight into building their projects, but this lesson will help shape their ideas into plans. This structure will keep the dreamers grounded and illuminate a path for those feeling left in the dark. Provide students with ample time to build and revise their projects. The trial and error inevitably involved in this lesson will teach problem solving and persistence.",
        "student_overview": "Projects this big take time and plenty of planning. Find your inspiration, develop a plan, and unleash your creativity!"

        "description": "* **empathy**: to imagine the feelings that someone else is experiencing\n* **interpret**: to understand something based on our point of view\n\n**Before the lesson**: As an optional activity before the lesson, have students play the [E-volve](https://www.digitalpassport.org/evolve.html) game in Digital Passport™ by Common Sense Education. This will help introduce key concepts of this lesson. To see more, check out the [Digital Passport Educator Guide](https://d1e2bohyu2u2w9.cloudfront.net/education/sites/default/files/tlr-asset/document-bundled-educator-guide-92018.pdf).\n\n**Project** [Slide 4](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kUVxRuQ_CUDpeSm3Sqg4yyueITjc3qQMUpSTi0WP4so/edit#slide=id.g3da8846a99_1_0) and ask students: *Imagine when you walked in, I said to you* [in a friendly tone, with a big smile] *\"Hello!\" Which emoji would fit?*\n\nHave students show their answer by holding up fingers (1, 2, 3, or 4). If anyone holds up a number other than 1, ask them to share out why.\n\n**Repeat** this two more times, saying *Hello* differently each time: once with an angry tone and a scowl, and once with a nervous or scared tone.\n\n**Project** [Slide 5](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kUVxRuQ_CUDpeSm3Sqg4yyueITjc3qQMUpSTi0WP4so/edit#slide=id.g3da8846a99_2_13) and ask: *What about if you're just reading it? How does it make you feel now?*\n\nPoint out how when something is just in text, it can be even more difficult to interpret what someone means. Explain that their responses might be different depending on who they are because we all interpret the world a little differently. Clarify that interpret means *to understand something based on our point of view.* ([Slide 6](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kUVxRuQ_CUDpeSm3Sqg4yyueITjc3qQMUpSTi0WP4so/edit#slide=id.g3d844aea9e_1_4))\n\n**Say**: *Because words can be interpreted differently by different people, it's important to think about the words we use and how they affect people. We might say something just to be funny, but someone might take it seriously, and it might hurt their feelings. This can happen in person, and it can also happen online. It may even happen more online, because the words are just text -- we're not actually face-to-face with other people.*",

Students will identify various values for the variables found in food chains (Example: plants, animals, decomposer, etc.) as they document these values on notecards and show the movement of matter through an environment. Students will also learn about the 10% Rule and further describe energy flow with a writing prompt.\n\n*Standards Addressed:*\n * **CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.W.5.2.B:** Develop the topic with facts, definitions, concrete details, quotations, or other information and examples related to the topic.\n\n* **CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.5.NF.B.7.C:** Solve real world problems involving division of unit fractions by non-zero whole numbers and division of whole numbers by unit fractions, e.g., by using visual fraction models and equations to represent the problem. \n\n* **NGSS.5-LS2-1:** Develop a model to describe the movement of matter among plants, animals, decomposers, and the environment. \n"

As they do, ask them to provide positive and constructive feedback to each other. The benefit here is that students will have the opportunity to provide and respond to feedback in a smaller setting.\n- **Gallery Walk:**  Ensure all students have their projects ready for testing. Have students move \"musical chairs\"-style to another computer and play/test the project there for a few minutes, until they receive a signal from you to move to another computer.
