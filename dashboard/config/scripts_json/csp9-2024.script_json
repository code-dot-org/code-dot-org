The teacher has students quickly share their reasoning for prioritizing each question, rotating students through each area and reminding students that it is okay to change their priorities if they hear a convincing argument."

Make it quick and straightforward – this isn't about writing a lot, just enough to jog your memory when answering.\n4. **Freewrite / Annotate each key term with example ideas**:  Jot down potential examples or ideas related to the question to stimulate creativity and provide content for the response.\n:::"
