Students will get hands-on practice with supervised and reinforcement learning. They’ll start with data that has already been sorted and progress to making predictions on their own of how to sort items on screen. In the final level, students will try their hand at sorting data on their own and will enlist a partner to predict how the items have been categorized.\n\nThis hands-on experience will be complemented by discussions on the significance of data categorization and the challenges posed by limited datasets. Students will explore a real-world example where AI predictions have been used to help humans. The lesson aims to demystify AI technology, emphasizing its pattern-based logic rather than perceiving it as magical or random.\n",

An AI machine is simply a computer that can make decisions after learning from data given to it by humans. A few real world examples of AI include: voice assistants like Siri or Alexa, self driving cars, and robots. \n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: Show “Discuss” slide\n\n**Discuss:**\n* _What is this AI robot doing?_\n* _How do you think it learned how to do this?_\n* _What do you think would happen if you put a red block on the table?_\n* _What are some things this robot probably can not do?_\n\n**Discussion Goal:** Students should notice that this robot has likely been trained how to sort between blue and green blocks. If it has not been taught how to sort red blocks it might incorrectly sort them into the blue or green items or leave it on the table. This robot likely cannot perform tasks unless they involve human-like motor skills. For example, this robot likely cannot generate text, speak, or see.

By selecting the effects themselves, they can create any combination they want but it’s often tedious to click each option from the dropdown menu. Having AI select the effects based on 3 emojis is easier, but may not yield the exact results that students want. One potential solution is for students to work with AI by having it create a first draft and having students edit the results. In this case, students can have AI generate the effects and then they can click “Use code” and make any adjustments. \n",

It told me, “Orange and red”. When my classmate asked the AI it said, “Purple and pink”._\n\n**Discussion Goal:** Make sure students understand that AI is trained on billions of data points representing many different opinions. Since not everyone agrees on for example, what colors are in a sunset, AI will make a prediction based on the probabilities of different responses. If most people say that a sunset contains the colors orange and red, then AI will usually say “orange and red”. But since sometimes people see purple and pink in a sunset, AI will occasionally say “purple and pink.” Just as asking different people what colors are present in a sunset will yield different answers, asking AI the same question may result in different responses.\n\n\nHave students reflect on the Warm Up activity in which AI Pet Picker chose a rat, when we were expecting it to choose a puppy. Point out how each Pet Shop employee had different opinions about how cute each animal is and how big it is. Sometimes conflicting opinions in the training data can lead to conflicting AI predictions. If AI Pet Picker was trained on the opinions of everyone in the world, it might not pick the pet that you or I had in mind, but it would certainly reflect someone’s opinion from the training data.\n\nAdditionally, you can point out that there can be small and large effects of AI making a different or even incorrect prediction. In the previous lesson, if AI couldn’t correctly predict that a starfish belonged in the ocean, it would assume that it was trash which needed to be removed. In the real world, this could cause large negative environmental impacts.\n\n",

Some decisions that could be made based on this dataset: what flavors of ice cream or pizza to buy for a class party, whether recess should be inside or outside, what colors to use for classroom decorations or class folders.

They should understand that there are pros and cons to using AI tools and the decision is not “one size fits all”.
