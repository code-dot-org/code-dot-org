Student responses may vary but may include the following strategies:\n* Scan each row from left to right followed by scanning each column from top to bottom.\n* Check surrounding letters. Once you found the first letter or a key letter in a word you’re searching for, check the letters around it to see if you should keep going. For example, if you have a word with Q in it, if there’s no U next to it, then you need to keep searching.\n* Look for words that have less-common letters in them such as words with a Q, X, J, or Z\n* Look for words with letter pairs, such as double letters or QU\n* Look for more than one word at a time.\n* Turn the puzzle upside down"

Set the expectation early that reading these instructions, not just the \"Do This\" section, is important.\n* **Help and Tips Tab** This tab contains all of the relevant videos and reference guides for a particular level.\n  - **Videos:** Watched as a class, but students can always return to them.\n  * **Reference Guides:** Contain text and diagrams explaining content. These are intended as helpful student resources, not class readings. They are a good place to go for review after learning content or when students get stuck in levels. You may decide to print these and have them available for students as they work through levels.\n* **Documentation** A link to Web Lab's documentation is available in the upper-right corner of the instructions panel. Students can use this to refresh their memory on important tags introduced in the unit."

Talking about the organization, structure, or role of the content in the page (heading, paragraph, list, etc.) is more accurate than talking about specific aspects of its appearance (such as size or spacing).\n\nFor the second prompt, there's a direct answer: the paragraph tag separates text into paragraphs. You may want to follow up this question by asking students how they think a web browser for the blind might deal with paragraphs. For example, while sighted people may use spacing and new lines to separate out paragraphs, what should a screen reader do?\n\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Key Vocabulary:**\n\n- HTML - Hypertext Markup Language, a language used to create web pages\n- HTML Element - A piece of a website, marked by a start tag and often closed with an end tag\n- HTML Tag - The special set of characters that indicates the start and end of an HTML element and that element's type\n",

Why did you make the list? What was the list for? What type of stuff was in your list(s)?*\n\nKeep track of the different types of lists students identify.\n\n**Discussion Goal:** There are many possible answers.

Ask the students *\"What do you notice?

Allow their *What do you wonder* questions to linger. \n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** Show the second example of an HTML list and the result. Again, ask the students *What do you notice?

You may consider sharing with students that it is something *you* noticed if there are no students who volunteer that information. \n\nStudent responses to the second prompt, *What do you wonder*, for the second example may again vary but could include: \n\n* What does \"ol\" mean?\n* Why did this example make a numbered list?\n* Why are both examples using the `<li>` tag?\n* Why does making a list involve two different HTML tags? \n\n**Discussion Goal:** Use student responses from both rounds of *What do you notice? What do you wonder* to guide your discussion, making sure to cover the following key points:\n\n* To make an HTML list, they need both tags - the tag indicating the type of list they want and the tag indicating a list item.\n* The structure of the HTML list element is unlike other HTML elements they have used so far since there is no content that goes right next to the start `<ul>` or `<ol>` tag.\n* Once they have finished listing their items using the `<li>` tag, that is when they will finally use the closing `</ul>` or `</ol>` tag.\n* If they want their list to have a title, they need to use one of the heading tags they just learned about.

Depending on the difficulty level and time constraints, there are two project guide options to choose from. \n\n**Project Guide #1:** This version has detailed user descriptions with the potential topic headings already underlined and information they should include already highlighted for them. The students can look over what has been underlined and highlighted and make their design layout from there.Choose this option if your time is limited or if you have students who might need more support.  \n\n**Project Guide #2:** This version had detailed user descriptions with the first three potential topic headings already underlined as a starting point for the students. The remaining topic headings and the information that should be included for each topic are left up to the student to decide as the web developer. Choose this option if you have at least 2 days (1 day for planning and design and 1 day for building the webpage) or if your students would benefit from the extra challenge and web developer experience. \n\nMake sure you select the HTML Web Page Project Guide that corresponds to the option you choose.

To help smooth out the debugging experience, consider the following strategies:\n\n- Review the [Teacher Guide to Debugging](https://docs.google.com/document/d/145lvpomqz0tUuzXLbkAFgP9zMDpECMwFYiEIG1_hQFg/view) for some common questions and strategies to help support students in debugging their code\n- Have students follow the steps in the [Student Guide to Debugging](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wNwoKDyoUas5GGkhqGmNN1u0XGQEdeOMWhSziyYIf8o/edit#) and use the [Bug Report Quarter-Sheets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M6mnq73DfyvzasucVAwfL-gjl2JqVPzjy_fRx5j4j7c/preview) as an initial step in the debugging process. This helps students prepare and communicate their issue before asking for help.\n- If students haven't seen it yet, consider showing the [Debugging Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auv10y-dN4s) to the class to reinforce debugging best practices.\n\n**Digging Deeper:** Consider supplying students with an object to talk to as part of the debugging process. This is sometimes known as Rubber Duck Debugging - you can learn more on the website https://rubberduckdebugging.com/"

The style of the page is the specifics of its appearance. Without a particular style, each web browser would decide how to display different web page elements on its own.\n\nStyles are important to allow web developers to decide exactly how a web page looks on the screen. Because styles are separate from structure and content, web developers can change the style of an entire page very easily, without having to make any changes to the structure and content of the web page.

This helps students prepare and communicate their issue before asking for help.\n- If students haven't seen it yet, consider showing the [Debugging Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auv10y-dN4s) to the class to reinforce debugging best practices.\n\n**Digging Deeper:** Consider supplying students with an object to talk to as part of the debugging process.

Adding Flexbox concepts to an already created web page can often require the web developer to shift and move around the HTML content for the page to look as expected. As a result, this project has 3 options for you to choose from depending on the difficulty level and time constraints. \n\n**Easy:** Students can add classes and flexbox to web page content that is already organized to make adding `<div>` elements and flexbox style easy. Choose this option if you don’t have time available to allow your students to alter the code that will be brought over from the Lesson 10 mini-project.\n\n**Intermediate:** Students can add classes and Flexbox to the webpage they styled for Lesson 10. Choose this option if your students are up for the challenge and you have the extra time (possibly 2 days) to allow students to shift their HTML code, iterating on their HTML to make their page look as they expect.\n\n**Challenging:** Students can create a webpage for a user from scratch. Choose this option if you have at least 2-3 days to dedicate to this project and would like students to have the experience of building a webpage from beginning to end without breaks in between the process. If you choose this option, you might consider adding criteria from the previous mini-projects to the chapter project rubric to capture all the skills students will demonstrate.\n\nSelect the Chapter Project Guide that corresponds to your chosen option.\n"

To help smooth out the debugging experience, consider the following strategies:\n\n- Review the [Teacher Guide to Debugging](https://docs.google.com/document/d/145lvpomqz0tUuzXLbkAFgP9zMDpECMwFYiEIG1_hQFg/view) for some common questions and strategies to help support students in debugging their code\n- Have students follow the steps in the [Student Guide to Debugging](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wNwoKDyoUas5GGkhqGmNN1u0XGQEdeOMWhSziyYIf8o/edit#) and use the [Bug Report Quarter-Sheets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M6mnq73DfyvzasucVAwfL-gjl2JqVPzjy_fRx5j4j7c/preview) as an initial step in the debugging process. This helps students prepare and communicate their issue before asking for help.\n- If students haven't seen it yet, consider showing the [Debugging Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auv10y-dN4s) to the class to reinforce debugging best practices.\n\n**Digging Deeper:** Consider supplying students with an object to talk to as part of the debugging process. This is sometimes known as Rubber Duck Debugging - you can learn more on the website https://rubberduckdebugging.com/"
