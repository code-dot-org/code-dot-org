However, the other team member may not have an after school job, and because of this can point out the bias in that statement. \r\n\r\nCollaboration is key to catching bias in your work! \r\n\r\nHere's another example, this time in the design of an app. A team wants to make an app to encourage girls to sign up for a summer camp. One team member assumes that because this app is aimed at girls, the background should be pink. A girl on the team points out that she does not like pink, and using that color in the design may represent bias. \r\n\r\nAs you think about your topics and start designing your apps, remember to keep an eye out for bias and use your team mates to keep you accountable!",

It's hard to do a good job with bad tools!\n\nWhen running the second discussion push students to think about what a language designed for giving instructions would look like. While specific answers aren't important, you should push them to build on their experiences in the main activity. For example, if they saw that words having two meanings was confusing in the main activity, they should suggest redesigning the language so each word has a single well-understood meaning. \n\n"
