Ask your kids to floss, dab, or do a creative dance move of their own for 10 seconds to get them in the mood. You can play a song from this Spotify Playlist (all ages) to help kick things off.

        "description": "####General Support\n\n**General Support:** As a teacher your role is primarily to support students as they make their way through the tutorial. Here are a few tips that should help students regardless of the level they're working on:\n\n* Encourage students to move through the different “extras” in whatever order they like. They can always go back to Level 1 to revisit the menu.\n\n* **Collaborate with Neighbors:** Encourage students to check in with a neighbor when they're getting stuck. Since this tutorial includes videos and students may be wearing headphones it can get easy to \"go into a bubble\". Help break those barriers by actively pairing students if they seem like they need help. Depending on the age and ability of your students, you might consider formally breaking your class into pairs to complete the tutorial using [pair programming](https://youtu.be/vgkahOzFH2Q).  \n* **Read the Instructions:** The instructions usually provide helpful tips on how to complete the level. Before completing a level for a student ensure they've actually looked closely at the target image and read all the text there.\n* ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/hint.png)**Stuck? Look for hints:** Each level includes a hint with further details about how to pass the level. If students are trying to pass puzzles as quickly as possible, they might find they just need to wait a certain amount of time for all of the code to play out before moving on. Many levels contain a second hint with suggestions of ways to get even more creative by extending the task.\n* **Move On and Come Back:** Sometimes students will benefit more from coming back to a tricky level. All levels are independent of one another, though they do rely to some degree on previously introduced concepts. There are no right or wrong answers in these Levels. (They’re all free play!)\n\n* **Take your time and experiment.** Even though the first couple levels tell students exactly what they need to do to pass, they should also feel free to try out their own ideas.\n* Read the code carefully."

        "description": "After your Hour of Code ends, there are many ways to continue teaching computer science in your K-5 classroom. Here are some ideas:\n* Teach the [Code Studio Computer Science Fundamentals](http://code.org/educate/k5) courses. These six courses are designed for young learners. Students work their way through a series of puzzles that teach them to code, and educators have access to engaging lesson plans that help make the learning come alive. Code.org offers free professional development for these courses, online or in-person.\n* Visit [You can Teach Computer Science](https://code.org/teach) for more course suggestions.\n* Invite a computer science expert to talk to your class about his or her work. Don’t know any local computer scientists? Reach out to a volunteer on our [volunteer map](https://code.org/volunteer/local).\n",
