Bot to detect certain colored fish or fish with a certain shape and discover that A.I. Bot might be basing its decision on unintended factors. In the last level, students train A.I. bot to detect expressions and discover that A.I. Bot may be using unrelated features to make decisions in a way that isn’t fair.

After they finish, they then try to separate the data into groups - a fruit area, and a veggie area.

Since we trained our model only on fruits and vegetables, it doesn’t work very well on other types of foods. If we wanted to improve our model, we’d probably need a lot more data and a lot more features - more than just how sweet and easy-to-eat food is. This gets a lot harder for us as humans to understand, and we couldn’t use our graph paper anymore. Luckily, computers can help us with this!

The handout follows a story that ultimately has students working through and then reflecting on a regression algorithm. As students work through the handout, here are some places where you can check in or offer guidance. Also note that answers can be found in Regression Quest (Teacher Version) - Answer Key:\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Regression with Machine Learning\r\n\r\n**Questions 1, 2:** It is critical that students first become familiar with the training data. Question 1 simply asks them to mark whether each variable is categorical or numerical, then feature or label. Some students might see “Location #” as a variable, but in this case remind them that is an index used to identify a row in the dataset, and is not a feature. Question 2 asks students if they notice any relationships between variables in the dataset, another task students should become used to as they become more comfortable with AI and machine learning. An example response to this question is in the answer key, but encourage students to take their time answering as it is important that they explore the data before using it to train a model.\r\n\r\n**Question 3:** This question marks the beginning of the algorithm proper. Tom’s “setup program” assists students in creating their regression algorithm. First, just as Tom suggests, they will consider heading to their school. However, because the number of infections at the school is unknown, they need to come up with a plan. Tom suggests they first compare the school to all other locations in Tom’s dataset (i.e., the training data). Here, students should simply complete the table, where they compare their school’s features (“school”, “indoor”) to those of other locations, then write the total number of similarities for each comparison. Several rows have been prefilled to give them a start. Be sure to check in with students as they complete this step (it might be a good idea to do it as a class), as making errors here will impact the next steps of the algorithm.\r\n\r\n**Question 4:** This question asks students to write the three locations that are most similar to their school. That is, the three locations with the highest total similarities. The order they write these in doesn’t matter. To answer this question, students should refer to the table above, specifically the “Total Similarities” column.\r\n\r\n**Question 5:** Finally, Tom (with students’ help, of course) predicts the label for their school (i.e., infections) by summing the infections of the three most similar locations, then dividing by three. If your students have not yet learned how to calculate averages, or otherwise struggle with the arithmetic, please be sure to do this step as a class. \r\n\r\n**Question 6:** Here, students are free to write, in their own words, how they managed to train Tom to estimate the number of infections at the school. They should refer to all of the previous questions in the handout for guidance. A sample response is provided in the answer key.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Share Out:** Bring the class back together. If students worked mostly independently, go over the entire handout using the answer key as a reference. In any case, be sure to allow students to volunteer their own responses to Question 6, which also answers the question of the day."

Later on, they can continue to customize their app with Design Mode\n- **Level 6:** Students add a home screen to their app and use the Model Card to describe the name and purpose of the app. The instructions for this level may be difficult to keep track of - encourage students to “check off” each step as they complete it. They can also use the animated example on the level as a guide for how to complete this task.\n- **Level 7:** Students add a button from the home screen to the predict screen, and add an event to connect the two screens together. Support students in reading through the instructions and “checking off” each piece as they go along. They can also click the “Show Me How” lines in the instructions for screenshots of what each step can look like."

Here are some things to be on the lookout for as students work:\r\n\r\n- **Level 4:** Students practice deleting the default elements that are generated when you first import a model. This is a step that will be important when students create their own custom apps in later projects.\r\n- **Level 5 and 6:** Students are only updating the code of their app to use the new design elements for the Number of Cars and Weather features. They can use the hints within the level instructions for clues on what to do in each step.\r\n- **Level 7:** Students update both the design and the code of their app to collect data for the Temperature feature. Help students keep track of the new text input element they add to the temperature screen, and make sure the ID of the element matches the one they use in the `getText()` block of their code.\r\n- **Level 8:** Students update both the design and the code of their app to collect data for the Time of Day feature. Adding the design element and updating the code is similar to the last level, but this step has the added requirement of using the Model Card to check the possible values are for this categorical feature. Students may make spelling or capitalization errors that can effect their code - encourage students to be very careful to match their dropdown options exactly with the model card."

Of course, students like Thuy should be represented in the dataset too. \r\n- **Use of AI:** This solution uses AI to predict the number of hours Thuy will need to study to pass a test. Without AI, the solution might predict randomly or otherwise use some other method that isn’t based on students’ study data. While this might make things more complex in the short-run (since we need to obtain and analyze data), the app should be smarter in the long run. \r\n- **Scalability:** This solution should work for any student in a situation similar to Thuy’s. However, as we mentioned with impact, some students might be doing well with tests but failing with other things like homework, so this solution will not work well for them. \r\n- **Responsibility:** If the model behind this solution is inaccurate, Thuy might under-study and fail tests.

There are a few options available for students who encounter this:\n\n- If a dataset is _close_ to a student’s initial idea, encourage them to adjust their app idea to match the data available. This happens frequently when developing machine learning apps as well since the apps can only work with the data that is available\n- If students find a dataset that looks interesting but is unrelated to their topic, encourage them to adjust their app idea to use the new dataset. They will need to re-complete Part 1 of the Project Guide, but the rest of the activity can continue as normal using the new dataset\n- If students have picked a highly relevant topic but there aren’t any supporting datasets, students have the following options:\n\t- You can help students use a program like Google Forms to collect their own data to create a Machine Learning model. [Click Here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Yzoug2iW-_GUWrQJo4jIlfuKNtelVNrer1PvT4rXF7w/copy) to make a copy of a form that students can use as a template. Once students have collected enough data, they can export their data as a .csv file and upload it to AI Lab. [Click Here](https://www.loom.com/share/243208cbfb1e427c81fc7d2bac43f1e9) for a video showing how you and students can use this form with AI Lab\n\t- You can help students search for new datasets using a Machine Learning dataset website like [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/). This site can be overwhelming and not all of the datasets will work with AI Lab, so students will need guidance on how to find appropriate datasets\n"
