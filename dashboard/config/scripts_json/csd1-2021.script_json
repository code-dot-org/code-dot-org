If you attended a Code.org TeacherCon during the summer, you should already have this access.\n\nTo check whether you have access:\n\n1. Navigate to the [Unit 1 course overview page](https://studio.code.org/s/csd1-2021)\n2. Do you see the CS Discoveries Pre-course Survey as the first \"stage\" of the course?\n3. If not, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdGGAJuaDMBVIRYnimPhAL96w6fCl4UdvhwmynGONM75TWwWw/viewform). Note that it can take a day or so to become a verified teacher account, so please do this step early!\n\nIf you are *not* a verified teacher account, you can still create a section for your class, but you will not be able to administer the pre-course survey on the first day.\n\n\n#### Create a class section on Code Studio.\n\nTo create a section:\n\n1. Navigate to the [Teacher Home Page](https://studio.code.org/home)\n2. Click 'New section' under 'Classroom Sections'\n3. Choose 'Email Logins' \n4. In the space provided, give your section a name (e.g. CSD Period 1), the grade of your students, Course: 'Computer Science Discoveries', Current Unit: 'Unit 1: Problem Solving', and click 'Save'\n5. Once the section is created, click the name of the section\n6. On the new page, you will see a unique Join URL that you will distribute to your students in class. \n\nFor a video walkthrough of these steps and more on navigating your Code.org account, go to the \n[r how-to-videos/csd/2021]"

Make groups of 2 or 3 you know need to be together and then figure out which groups can't be at the same table. \r\n\r\nThis isn't the only approach to the problem, and you shouldn't rush to introduce it as such.

On the left side they can make a rough sketch of what their app would look like. This does not need to be a final draft and is just there to help them brainstorm ideas and communicate to another group how their app would look. On the right side they have space to label each individual piece of information on the screen.\n\nUsing the outputs that students selected as a guide, students should pick the inputs they'll need to create them. Only 6 spaces are provided though students could opt to choose more. This is somewhat intentional to help students scope the functionality of their app.\n\nStudents will describe the way their app processes data using as a model the way they would process it themselves. The goal here is primarily just to ensure students have selected inputs that could be processed to produce the outputs. For example, if they're finding a list of friends with birthdays this month then both a computer and human would need to know a list of friends' birthdays and the current month.\n\nLastly students are asked to decide what information, if any, it makes sense to store long term.\n\n**Distribute:** [Apps and Problem Solving - Peer Review](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13ekhJvtz1vovS6FhGBeDf1mcYFRyJe65bQdi8S8T9lU/edit), one copy to each pair of students\n\n**Step 7: Peer Review**: Each group should trade their project guides with another. They should fill out the first line of the peer review which asks what specific part of their project they'd like feedback on. Afterward, there are a number of directed questions as well as a chance to provide more open-ended feedback on the idea.\n\nStudents should be given their project guides back as well as their peer feedback. On the back, there are questions where they can indicate what changes or improvements to their projects they intend to make on their apps based on the feedback.\n\n**Step 8: Finalize App and Make Poster**: Students should incorporate the ideas of their peers in finalizing their app idea. They should then make a poster presenting their app following the guidance provided in the activity guide."

If you attended a Code.org TeacherCon during the summer, you should already have this access.\n\nTo check whether you have access:\n\n1. Navigate to the [Unit 1 course overview page](https://studio.code.org/s/csd1-2018)\n2. Do you see the CS Discoveries Pre-course Survey as the first \"stage\" of the course?\n3. If not, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdGGAJuaDMBVIRYnimPhAL96w6fCl4UdvhwmynGONM75TWwWw/viewform). Note that it can take a day or so to become a verified teacher account, so please do this step early!\n\nIf you are *not* a verified teacher account, you can still create a section for your class, but you will not be able to administer the pre-course survey on the first day.\n\n\n#### Create a class section on Code Studio.\n\nTo create a section:\n\n1. Navigate to the [Teacher Home Page](https://studio.code.org/home)\n2. Click 'New section' under 'Classroom Sections'\n3. Choose 'Email Logins' \n4. In the space provided, give your section a name (e.g. CSD Period 1), the grade of your students, Course: 'Computer Science Discoveries', Current Unit: 'Unit 1: Problem Solving', and click 'Save'\n5. Once the section is created, click the name of the section\n6. On the new page, you will see a unique Join URL that you will distribute to your students in class. \n\nFor a video walkthrough of these steps and more on navigating your Code.org account, go to the [Code.org How-to Video Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7-6SpcrToamXzSMUKkEYZfKTzi6gJos5)",

You might consider administering it on an admin day at school, or as an early homework.\n\n**When should I give the survey?** Because it is a pre-course survey it is important that students take it as early in the course as possible before they have had much (or any) exposure to the class so that we may accurately gauge changes in attitudes and beliefs caused by the course.",

If you attended a Code.org TeacherCon during the summer, you should already have this access.\n\nTo check whether you have access:\n\n1. Navigate to the [Unit 1 course overview page](https://studio.code.org/s/csd1-2018)\n2. Do you see the CS Discoveries Pre-course Survey as the first \"stage\" of the course?\n3. If not, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdGGAJuaDMBVIRYnimPhAL96w6fCl4UdvhwmynGONM75TWwWw/viewform). Note that it can take a day or so to become a verified teacher account, so please do this step early!\n\nIf you are *not* a verified teacher account, you can still create a section for your class, but you will not be able to administer the pre-course survey on the first day.\n\n\n#### Create a class section on Code Studio.\n\nTo create a section:\n\n1. Navigate to the [Teacher Home Page](https://studio.code.org/home)\n2. Click 'New section' under 'Classroom Sections'\n3. Choose 'Email Logins' \n4. In the space provided, give your section a name (e.g. CSD Period 1), the grade of your students, Course: 'Computer Science Discoveries', Current Unit: 'Unit 1: Problem Solving', and click 'Save'\n5. Once the section is created, click the name of the section\n6. On the new page, you will see a unique Join URL that you will distribute to your students in the class. \n\nFor a video walkthrough of these steps and more on navigating your Code.org account, go to the [Code.org How-to Video Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7-6SpcrToamXzSMUKkEYZfKTzi6gJos5)",

If you attended a Code.org TeacherCon during the summer, you should already have this access.\n\nTo check whether you have access:\n\n1. Navigate to the [Unit 1 course overview page](https://studio.code.org/s/csd1-2018)\n2. Do you see the CS Discoveries Pre-course Survey as the first \"stage\" of the course?\n3. If not, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdGGAJuaDMBVIRYnimPhAL96w6fCl4UdvhwmynGONM75TWwWw/viewform). Note that it can take a day or so to become a verified teacher account, so please do this step early!\n\nIf you are *not* a verified teacher account, you can still create a section for your class, but you will not be able to administer the pre-course survey on the first day.\n\n\n#### Create a class section on Code Studio.\n\nTo create a section:\n\n1. Navigate to the [Teacher Home Page](https://studio.code.org/home)\n2. Click 'New section' under 'Classroom Sections'\n3. Choose 'Email Logins' \n4. In the space provided, give your section a name (e.g. CSD Period 1), the grade of your students, Course: 'Computer Science Discoveries', Current Unit: 'Unit 1: Problem Solving', and click 'Save'\n5. Once the section is created, click the name of the section\n6. On the new page, you will see a unique Join URL that you will distribute to your students in the class. \n\nFor a video walkthrough of these steps and more on navigating your Code.org account, go to the [Code.org How-to Video Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7-6SpcrToamXzSMUKkEYZfKTzi6gJos5).",

Some layouts might not end up seeming as practical to other group members. Some are fun but require too much moving or too many new things. Feedback is an important part of the reflect step, especially in group work."
