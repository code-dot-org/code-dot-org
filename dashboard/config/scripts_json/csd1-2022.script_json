They then look at a series of apps and use their decisions about what should be stored to create guidelines for deciding what information to store.  They then review the four components of this chapter's model of computing: input, output, storage, and processing.  Afterwards, they have one last opportunity to revise their decisions about which items should be classified as a \"computer\" from earlier in the chapter.  The lesson ends with a reflection on their own app ideas and how storage could be used.",

At this point, students know that computers are information processing machines that can do four things with information: input, output, store, and process.  In this final lesson before the unit project, students look at types of input that may be needed to solve a particular problem and describe the processing and storage that a computer would do to produce the desired output.  This should prepare them to eventually design their own app to address a problem and explain how that app would work.",

The [How to Administer a Locked Assessment](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/115001331951-Using-lock-settings-for-assessments-and-surveys) support article provides details on how to do that when you are ready. Note that the instructions for administering an assessment and a survey are the same.    \n\n**How much time does it take?** The survey does take some time - it is roughly 30 questions.  You might consider administering it on an admin day at school, or as an early homework.\n\n**When should I give the survey?** Because it is a pre-course survey it is important that students take it as early in the course as possible before they have had much (or any) exposure to the class so that we may accurately gauge changes in attitudes and beliefs caused by the course.",

Make groups of 2 or 3 you know need to be together and then figure out which groups can't be at the same table. \r\n\r\nThis isn't the only approach to the problem, and you shouldn't rush to introduce it as such. Rather, encourage students to discuss with one another what they know needs to be true at the end and whether different approaches might help.\r\n\r\n**Draw Pictures:** Students will likely do better if they draw pictures. You may wish for students to use a journal or scratch paper as a place to brainstorm ideas.\r\n\r\n**Extending the Problem:** If one group finishes far before others you could give them a blank sheet of paper and ask them to solve the problem again but with a new condition of your choosing (e.g. pick two people sitting at the same table in their solution and ask whether they can solve the problem now that those two people are also in a fight.)\r\n"

They needed to decide for themselves what a \"good\" room looked like, and this definition could have even shifted throughout the process.\n* **Prepare**: Narrowing down a list of possible layout is helpful. You may also choose to make the point that this entire activity is an example of preparation. Some layouts just don't make sense or others work better, so you need to do the kind of planning they're doing here.\n* **Try**: As before, patience and persistence is important to see your plan through\n* **Reflect**: In this problem reflection came primarily through feedback from peers. Some layouts might not end up being that interesting to other group members. Some are fun but require too much moving or too many new things. Feedback is an important part of the reflect step, especially in group work."

If necessary, you can keep going back further to a \"Crawl\" step as well. \n\n**Digging Deeper:** This is sometimes referred to as the Minimal Viable Product - you can learn more about this process and adapt it into your project strategies by reading this article: [Making Sense of MVP](https://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp) by Henrik Kniberg\n\n"

        "description": "**Step 6: Input, Output, Store, Process**: In this step students design the way their app will actually work to process data. \n\nFirst students will draw and then describe the outputs of their apps. On the left side they can make a rough sketch of what their app would look like. This does not need to be a final draft and is just there to help them brainstorm ideas and communicate to another group how their app would look. On the right side they have space to label each individual piece of information on the screen.\n\nUsing the outputs that students selected as a guide, students should pick the inputs they'll need to create them. Only 6 spaces are provided though students could opt to choose more. This is somewhat intentional to help students scope the functionality of their app.\n\nStudents will describe the way their app processes data using as a model the way they would process it themselves. The goal here is primarily just to ensure students have selected inputs that could be processed to produce the outputs. For example, if they're finding a list of friends with birthdays this month then both a computer and human would need to know a list of friends' birthdays and the current month.\n\nLastly students are asked to decide what information, if any, it makes sense to store long term.\n\n**Distribute:** Apps and Problem Solving - Peer Review, one copy to each pair of students\n\n**Step 7: Peer Review**: Each group should trade their project guides with another. They should fill out the first line of the peer review which asks what specific part of their project they'd like feedback on. Afterward, there are a number of directed questions as well as a chance to provide more open-ended feedback on the idea.\n\nStudents should be given their project guides back as well as their peer feedback. On the back, there are questions where they can indicate what changes or improvements to their projects they intend to make on their apps based on the feedback."

If you attended a Code.org professional learning workshop during the summer, you should already have this access.\n\nTo check whether you have access:\n\n1. Navigate to the [Unit 1 course overview page](https://studio.code.org/s/csd1-2018)\n2. Do you see the CS Discoveries Pre-course Survey as the first \"stage\" of the course?\n3. If not, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdGGAJuaDMBVIRYnimPhAL96w6fCl4UdvhwmynGONM75TWwWw/viewform). Note that it can take a day or so to become a verified teacher account, so please do this step early!\n\nIf you are *not* a verified teacher account, you can still create a section for your class, but you will not be able to administer the pre-course survey on the first day.\n\n\n#### Create a class section on Code Studio.\n\nTo create a section:\n\n1. Navigate to the [Teacher Home Page](https://studio.code.org/home)\n2. Click 'New section' under 'Classroom Sections'\n3. Choose 'Email Logins' \n4. In the space provided, give your section a name (e.g. CSD Period 1), the grade of your students, Course: 'Computer Science Discoveries', Current Unit: 'Unit 1: Problem Solving', and click 'Save'\n5. Once the section is created, click the name of the section\n6. On the new page, you will see a unique Join URL that you will distribute to your students in the class. \n\nFor a video walkthrough of these steps and more on navigating your Code.org account, go to the [Code.org How-to Video Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7-6SpcrToamXzSMUKkEYZfKTzi6gJos5)",

If you attended a Code.org professional learning workshop during the summer, you should already have this access.\n\nTo check whether you have access:\n\n1. Navigate to the [Unit 1 course overview page](https://studio.code.org/s/csd1-2018)\n2. Do you see the CS Discoveries Pre-course Survey as the first \"stage\" of the course?\n3.

Note that it can take a day or so to become a verified teacher account, so please do this step early!\n\nIf you are *not* a verified teacher account, you can still create a section for your class, but you will not be able to administer the pre-course survey on the first day.\n\n\n#### Create a class section on Code Studio.\n\nTo create a section:\n\n1. Navigate to the [Teacher Home Page](https://studio.code.org/home)\n2. Click 'New section' under 'Classroom Sections'\n3. Choose 'Email Logins' \n4.

For example there may be certain things they'd like to move, places people will have to go, people they want to help them, etc.\r\n\r\n**Circulate:** Once groups have goals, they will move through the activity by developing a plan to create the adoption event. Give them a time limit on this part of this process, e.g. 15 minutes, to make sure they focus on the key elements on their plan rather than perfecting it. They should record key information about their plan in their activity guides.\r\n\r\nBring groups back together and have them share their initial plans. On the activity guides they can record the feedback their classmates give them on their plans.\r\n\r\nOnce groups have discussed what they like or don't like about their classmates' proposed plans, they can re-examine them and make improvements. Are there other things they'd like to do? Do they have new goals?

Some layouts just don't make sense or others work better, so you need to do the kind of planning they're doing here.\r\n* **Try**: As before, patience and persistence is important to see your plan through\r\n* **Reflect**: In this problem reflection came primarily through feedback from peers. Some layouts might not end up seeming as practical to other group members. Some are fun but require too much moving or too many new things.

Rather, encourage students to discuss with one another what they know needs to be true at the end and whether different approaches might help.\r\n\r\n**Draw Pictures:** Students will likely do better if they try out different solutions. You may wish for students to use a journal or scratch paper as a place to brainstorm ideas.\r\n\r\n**Extending the Problem:** If one group finishes far before others you could give them a blank sheet of paper and ask them to solve the problem again but with a shorter time.  The minimum time for the solution is 42 minutes, and if students have already reached that time, challenge them to explain how they know that their time is the fastest.\r\n\r\n"

Give students time to choose the goals they'll use to plan their game. For example there may be certain space restrictions, number of students included, etc.\r\n\r\nOnce groups have goals, they will move through the activity by developing a plan to make their game. Give them a time limit on this part of this process, e.g. 15 minutes, to make sure they focus on the key elements on their plan rather than perfecting it. They should record key information about their plan in their activity guides.\r\n\r\nBring groups back together and have them share their initial plans. On the activity guides they can record the feedback their classmates give them on their plans.\r\n\r\nOnce groups have discussed what they like or don't like about their classmates' proposed plans, they can re-examine them and make improvements. Are there other things they'd like to do? Do they have new goals? Give them several minutes to make improvements to their plans before deciding on a final version.\r\n\r\nBring the class back together and have them record the different steps of the problem solving process that they used in their activity guides.\r\n\r\n**Discuss:** Briefly discuss with students what parts of the activity they felt fell into each step of the problem solving process.

You may also choose to make the point that this entire activity is an example of preparation. Some games just don't make sense or others work better, so you need to do the kind of planning they're doing here.\r\n* **Try**: As before, patience and persistence is important to see your plan through\r\n* **Reflect**: In this problem reflection came primarily through feedback from peers. Some games might not end up being that interesting to other group members. Some are fun but require too much work or too many materials. Feedback is an important part of the reflect step, especially in group work."
