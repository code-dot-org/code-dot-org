        "description": "### Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy\n\n\n* **New Topics, Same Classroom Culture:** This unit is students' first experience with programming. It is designed to maintain the collaborative and inclusive classroom environment developed in the previous two units. The collaborative project, fun, unplugged activities, and the focus on experimenting should help keep your whole class working together and trying out ideas. \n\n* **Emphasizing Skills:** Since this is the first of many programming units, it emphasizes attitudes and skills that will serve your students well for the remainder of the year. The project that runs through this unit emphasizes that programming is a creative and collaborative endeavor that students can use to help others. Key practices like pair programming and debugging help normalize working with a partner, asking for help, and making mistakes. While students have a lot to learn about programming and App Lab, there is just as much emphasis on establishing these positive habits and mindsets. \n\n* **Empowering \"Creators\":** This unit empowers students to be creators with a major emphasis on making personally meaningful apps. Students have a lot to learn about programming. Still, the goal is for students to come away from this unit, seeing programming as a powerful form of personal expression that allows them to draw on their innate talents and interests to help solve problems in their community.\n\n### Major Assessment and Projects\n\nThe unit project asks students to collaborate with a classmate to design an app that can teach others about a topic of shared interest. Students practice interviewing classmates to identify the project's goals, mockup designs, collaboratively program the app and run simple user tests. The app itself must include at least three screens and demonstrate what students have learned about user interface design and event-driven programming. Students submit their app, project guide, and written responses to reflection questions about how the app is designed and the development process used to make it. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n\n### AP Connections\n\nThis unit and unit project helps build towards the enduring understandings listed below. For a detailed mapping of units to Learning Objectives and EKs, please see the \"Standards\" page for this unit.\n\n* CRD-1: incorporating multiple perspectives through collaboration improves computing innovations as they are developed.\n* CRD-2: developers create and innovate using an iterative design process that is user-focused, that incorporates implementation/feedback cycles, and that leaves ample room for experimentation and risk-taking.\n* AAP-2: The way statements are sequenced and combined in a program determines the computed result. Programs incorporate iteration and selection constructs to represent repetition and make decisions to handle varied input values.\n* AAP-3: Programmers break down problems into smaller and more manageable pieces. By creating procedures and leveraging parameters, programmers generalize processes that can be reused. Procedures allow programmers to draw upon existing code that has already been tested, allowing them to write programs more quickly and with more confidence.\n\nThis unit includes content from the following topics from the AP CS Principles Framework. For more detailed information on topic coverage in the course review [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RniAGymLBBpIpDaNNR5Ea8CgiiUKv0tMvaDixSj6m_Q/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n* 1.1 Collaboration\n* 1.2 Program Function and Purpose\n* 1.3 Program Design and Development\n\nThe College Board has supplied formative Create PT questions to help prepare students to complete the Create Task. We recommend that students complete the following prompts with the unit project. More information can be found in Code.org CS Principles Topic Coverage.\n\n* 3.a.i.\n* 3.a.ii.\n* 3.a.iii\n"

When students mentions specific lines of code actually scroll to that line and read through it together.\n\n**Discuss specific lines of code:** As you run discussions, model talking about programs by specifically calling out lines of code, as in \"I can see that when the playSound block on line 2 is highlighted the sound plays....\"\n\n**Save modifications for the end:** This lesson can be tight on time. Rather than have students modify the code all at once, you can save modifications for the end of the Code Investigation and have students pick a single app they wish to modify.\n\n**OK to Break Things:** When using the widgets in Units 1 and 2 it's not really possible to \"break things\". That's a little different than how things work in App Lab where it is possible to write code that may not run at all. Encourage students that this is ok. Using blocks makes it easier to avoid errors, and if students need to they can use the version history to set the code back to its original state.\n"

Circulate the room making sure that pairs are actually discussing the prompt and are collaborating to modify the program. Once it seems all groups have had a chance to do this bring the class together.\n\n**Discuss:** Have students share the results of their discussions with the class. You do not need to use formal vocabulary yet, but make sure all students are seeing the same things.\n\n* Code is running one line at a time.\n* Strings need to go in quotes. Numbers do not need to.\n* Yellow highlighting shows you which line of code is running in either block or text mode.\n* The turtle slider changes the speed at which the code runs. At full speed (all the way to the right) there is no longer any highlighting.\n\n**Level 2:** Run this level in the same way. Have students complete all three prompts and then bring the class together after a few minutes for a discussion.\n\n**Discuss:** Once again have students share the results of their discussions and modifications with the room. Here are some good points to draw out if they don't come up naturally in the discussion.\n\n* [`console.log`(#BB77C7)](/docs/applab/console.log/) prints text in the Debug Console\n* [`setProperty`(#fff176)](/docs/applab/setProperty/) changes the properties of elements on the screen. These should be familiar from using Design Mode.\n* [`console.log`(#BB77C7)](/docs/applab/console.log/) needs one input while [`setProperty`(#fff176)](/docs/applab/setProperty/) needs three\n* Hovering over a block in the toolbox helps you know what kind of information to put in each input.\n\n**Level 3:** Run this level in the same way. Have students complete all three prompts and then bring the class together after a few minutes for a discussion.\n\n**Discuss:** Once again have students share the results of their discussions and modifications with the room. Here are some good points to draw out if they don't come up naturally in the discussion.\n\n* [`onEvent`(#fff176)](/docs/applab/onEvent/) makes the program respond to the user. You can add code inside of it that will only run when something happens.\n* Changing the second input changes the type of interaction that will make the code inside the [`onEvent`(#fff176)](/docs/applab/onEvent/) run. \n* Code outside the [`onEvent`(#fff176)](/docs/applab/onEvent/) runs right away. Code inside an [`onEvent`(#fff176)](/docs/applab/onEvent/) will only run when the event happens.\n* Even if code is after an [`onEvent`(#fff176)](/docs/applab/onEvent/), it will run first if it's outside of any [`onEvent`(#fff176)](/docs/applab/onEvent/)\n\n**Level 4:** Run this level in the same way. Have students complete all three prompts and then bring the class together after a few minutes for a discussion.\n\n**Discuss:** Have students share the results of their discussion and anything else they noticed. Here are good points to draw out.\n\n* [`setScreen(screenId)`(#fff176)](/docs/applab/setScreen/) inside an [`onEvent`(#fff176)](/docs/applab/onEvent/) allows the user to navigate between app screens.\n\n**Level 5:** Run this level in the same way. Have students complete all three prompts and then bring the class together after a few minutes for a discussion.\n\n**Discuss:** Have students share the results of their discussion and anything else they noticed. Here are good points to draw out.\n\n* [`playSound`(#fff176)](/docs/applab/playSound/) will play a sound you pick from the Sound Library\n*  Lines that start with ` // ` are called comments and don't actually run. They just help you understand your code.\n\n**Level 6:** Run this level in the same way. Have students complete all three prompts and then bring the class together after a few minutes for a discussion.\n\n**Discuss:** Have students share the results of their discussion and anything else they noticed. Here are good points to draw out.\n\n* Random number chooses a new random number each time, between the high and low value given\n* [`onEvent`(#fff176)](/docs/applab/onEvent/) takes many different event types, not just `\"mouseOver\"` and `\"click\"`. Depending on the situation different ones make more sense."
