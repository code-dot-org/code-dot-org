Building this fluency early will make later lessons easier.\n\n**Teaching Tip: Not Every Flagged Message is Inappropriate** - When a student's on-task message is flagged, it doesn't necessarily indicate inappropriate behavior; it may simply be due to a specific word triggering our filters. We encourage trying alternative words or questions. Context is crucial, as legitimate discussions can sometimes be flagged. For instance, messages mentioning \"Hitler\" are automatically flagged, which has helped us monitor student programs in the past but in this unit it affects almost any discussion on World War II, even legitimate ones. Therefore, a flagged message should be carefully reviewed to discern if it's genuinely inappropriate or just caught by our system's parameters."

After students lock in their predictions, the teacher leads a discussion asking for students to share their observations and hypotheses. There are no right-or-wrong answers - they’re just predictions. The teacher should avoid validating any predictions - instead, as the lesson progresses, students will get the chance to investigate their hypotheses and see how well their predictions matched with reality. This means the most important part of these discussions are students feeling comfortable sharing their intuitions and forming opinion, and less about “right or wrong” answers.

After hearing from a few students, continue to the next slide.\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td style=\"width: 25%\"><img src=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BpTaMUqNdcLTRqHfn9YyNqZstR0WIlZ8FkCQSlxTJqw/export/png?id=1BpTaMUqNdcLTRqHfn9YyNqZstR0WIlZ8FkCQSlxTJqw&pageid=g2dba12ec68d_0_99\"></td>\n    <td style=\"width: 75%\">\n      <i class=\"fa fa-desktop\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> <strong>Navigate:</strong> Go to Lesson 3 Level 3.

After students lock in their predictions, the teacher leads a discussion asking for students to share their observations and hypotheses. There are no right-or-wrong answers - they’re just predictions. The teacher should avoid validating any predictions - instead, as the lesson progresses, students will get the chance to investigate their hypotheses and see how well their predictions matched with reality. This means the most important part of these discussions are students feeling comfortable sharing their intuitions and forming opinion, and less about “right or wrong” answers.

This can help us understand how the sentence “The food in Tucson is awesome - some great restaurants in Tucson are Poco and Moms, Kingfisher, and Franks.” impacts our model.\n- In the initial training data, a word like “Franks” was probably “close” to an entirely different set of words. For example: it could be “close” to “hot dog” or “person” or “blunt” because of the phrase “Let me be frank with you…”\n- This sentence creates a new association between “Franks” and the phrase “great restaurant”, along with other great restaurants like Kingfisher and Poco and Moms.\n- This helps update the embedding for “Franks” so it is now “closer” to other great restaurants, and more likely to be listed in a chatbot response."

Otherwise, it may be better to spend class working with students who need additional support based on yesterday’s lesson and the check-in level. Verified teachers can review exemplars and strategies for each level as a resource in the lesson plan.\n\n**Teaching Tip: Less Writing, More Copying**\nThis lesson implicitly encourages students to spend their time searching for sources and copying directly from them, rather than trying to write retrieval information themselves (which is mostly what they did yesterday). This correlates to how retrieval works in a more realistic sense with actual language models: instead of looking at individual words or statements, modern large-language models ingest entire documents or manuals or websites in order to augment their knowledgebase. For that reason, try to encourage students to put their energy into finding quality sources (like websites or books) to copy from, since this is the more realistic behavior of language models outside of this lab."

The clues are in how each chatbot loses the argument: since Aryanna’s chatbot loses the argument by its behavior and tone, that chatbot likely has a system prompt telling it to lose the argument. On the other hand, since Emma’s chatbot says incorrect information, it likely uses retrieval to set the incorrect information. Once these points are made, continue with the lesson.\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td style=\"width: 25%\"><img src=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YEm0J3733QiyulpXOsTAcgO4QInTIIKtdGc9q7dCn04/export/png?id=1YEm0J3733QiyulpXOsTAcgO4QInTIIKtdGc9q7dCn04&pageid=g2b5b268c506_0_197\"></td>\n    <td style=\"width: 75%\">\n      <i class=\"fa fa-microphone\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> <strong>Say:</strong> Even though these chatbots are ridiculous, they use system prompting and retrieval in very strategically to solve their problem.

The discussion aspect of these levels is vital to the lesson since it lets students heart other strategies and opinions to help inform their own thinking on when to use retrieval and when to use system prompt.

Students who may have been confident and engaged in earlier lessons may find themselves deflated by the task of writing about their chatbots and describing their decisions. It can be helpful to acknowledge this change in dynamic, but encourage students to lean into it rather than away from it. Taking time to document and describe our chatbots and other digital artifacts is a core part of any new technology, and might take a different set of skills but is just as important. Be sure to provide writing supports to students who may need it, such as having students explain it to you first before writing it down."

However, cue students to consider whether or not this is really a chatbot and whether the warnings and limitations are accurate. Ideally, the class realizes that this strategy doesn’t actually work well for a chatbot and instead is better just using a search engine. In fact, the description of the chatbot - typing in a place and getting information about it - could also describe a search engine. Students may also notice that when trying to use a chatbot for this, they may be more prone to hallucinations with no way to fact-check or verify.

In your classroom, you may decide to swap this out with another 5 Levels video that you think will be more engaging to students. Just ensure you have enough time to complete the rest of the activity, and you don’t choose something that privileges students who may have prior knowledge from other experiences - it should be something everyone is unfamiliar with."

This is similar in spirit to board games like [Pandemic](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30549/pandemic) or [Forbidden Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbidden_Island_(game))\n- Students will be in groups of 4, where all four people have taken on a persona [related to a specific scenario](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9P0FYWMBDQguWedAGi541P-HYbRS1gbcjFbFxdpRSk/edit). Their goal will be to work together to come up with guidelines for Generative AI that try to satisfy the needs and goals of everyone in the group. \n  - For example: an actor, a producer, an audience member, and a costume designer must work together to come up with guidelines for use of Generative AI in movie productions.\n- Each student has a particular persona they can embody on a [Character Card](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e0C1Tp1JhpnJNFjzlxI-bJpisZmZZe6uyglW0JgNm7s/edit). These cards include some baseline information about how this person might feel about generative AI, along with some news articles that students read and react to _as this character_.\n\n\nEven though the ultimate goal is to be in a group as a character solving a problem, the lesson plan introduces these steps in stages rather than explaining the full game all-at-once. First students are introduced to their character and read their news articles. Once they understand their character, then they form their groups and are given their scenario. And once they understand their scenario, they can begin the collaborative game of coming up with guidelines for generative AI."

This makes it easier to focus what students are doing in each class period, and it also creates an opportunity for students to user-test with members of the community. Consider having students use one of the user testing handouts with a friend or family member at home and bringing in the results the next day."
