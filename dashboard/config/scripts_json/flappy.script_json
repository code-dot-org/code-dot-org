        "description": "Explain that in computer science, “code” means a set of instructions that a computer can understand. Let students know that today, they are going to practice “coding,” “programming” and “debugging”.\r\n\r\nDefine:\r\n\r\n- **Coding** means to write code, or to write instructions for a computer.\r\n- **Programming**, similarly, means to write code or instructions. Today, you will program with blocks on the computer (if you’re using an online tutorial) or with pen and paper (if you’re using an unplugged activity).\r\n- **Debugging** means to check code for mistakes and try to fix errors.\r\n\r\nAsk students to think about what their ideal next step might be after high school graduation. Ask students to raise their hand if they believe that next step will require them to use a computer. Everyone should raise their hand, because computers are all around us...in our phones, in our cars, even in our microwaves and dishwashers!\r\n\r\nAsk students to guess how many K12 schools there are in the United States of America. The answer is around 100,000. Now ask students to guess how many of those K12 schools offer a course in computer science. The answer is less than 1 in 4 schools. That means that less than 25% of the US population has the opportunity to learn computer science in school. Ask students: how does this impact a young person's ability to land their dream job or get into their ideal college, if they have little to no experience with computers? And this problem exists not just in the US, but all over the world.\r\n\r\nExplain that across the globe, young people just like your students are participating in Hour of Code as a way to bring awareness to this injustice -- the lack of access to computer science education. Your class will be taking part, not just to learn the basics of CS and have a little fun -- but also to take a stand and use your voice to speak up about the importance of CS for all."
