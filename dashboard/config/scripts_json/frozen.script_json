Check your technology and decide if you need to troubleshoot anything in advance of your Hour of Code.\n- Review the supplementary lesson plan, [\"The Drawing Machine\"](https://code.org/curriculum/misc/hocunplugged/Teacher) to determine whether or not you'd like to lead this lesson in advance of your Hour of Code.\n\n### One Day Before Your Hour of Code\n\n- Write the words “coding”, “programming” and “debugging” on the board or add them to your word wall if you have one.\n- Write the words \"Computer Science\" in the middle of your board or on piece of paper at the center of a bulletin board. This will serve as your [\"mind map\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map) for the Getting Ready and Assessment activities.\n- Have protractors available for students new to measuring angles\n- Each student who completes the activity should receive a [certificate](http://code.org/certificates). Print one for each student in advance to make this easier at the end of your Hour of Code.\n",
