However, it's important to remember that correlation (similarities, patterns) does not equal causation (this thing caused that thing). There can be any number of reasons why a pattern or interesting data point may appear in a chart - and our job is to make an informed decision while recognizing that there may be multiple factors at play.  Usually additional research with several data sets is necessary to understand the exact nature of the relationship between data. Did this one thing cause another thing to happen? Do more people search for chocolate because they want to give it as a gift, or could there perhaps be another reason?\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> These two graphs show examples of visualizations that show a correlation between two factors, but it would be pretty hard to make the case that either of these things caused the other. These are some examples that are meant to be silly, but also they show us the importance of separating out the \"What\" from the \"Why\".\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> In this unit we will be making charts to help answer questions:\n\n* *\"I think this visualization tells me this…\"*\n\t* Something is more popular than something else\n\t* Something is more important than something else\n\t* Something has become more or less searched over time\n\n* *\"... but I'm not sure because…\"*\n\t* I don't know exactly how the data was collected\n\t* This might tell me people searched for green more than red, but it doesn't tell me why they do that or that green is a better color\n\t* We need more data!\n\n",
