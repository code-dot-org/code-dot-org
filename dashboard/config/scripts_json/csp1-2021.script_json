        "overview": "Students are asked to reflect on who owns their creative works from this class, such as their pixel images, before reading an article describing how ownership can become complicated as analog works become digital artifacts. After reading the article, students watch several videos explaining copyright and introducing them to the Creative Commons. Students then re-read the article answering three questions about the benefits, harms, and impacts of current copyright policy. Students use their new understanding of copyright to form an opinion about current copyright policies and create a small poster justifying their opinion with a quote from the article.",
        "student_overview": "Learn about how people can own digital information and the ways they can share access to their creative digital works.",
        "purpose": "Students have been examining how digital information is created and stored, but they have not closely examined the question of who owns their digital data and what rules govern how that information can be shared. This lesson introduces the concept of copyright by presenting students with an article that challenges their current understanding of digital ownership and makes them wrestle with some of the complexities of owning and sharing digital information. It’s important for students to talk through their ideas and hear the perspectives of their peers as they try to unpack how copyright law can impact society. Ultimately, students begin to form their own opinions about copyright focusing on how these policies impact the world around us and observing who benefits and who is harmed in particular copyright situations.\r\n\r\nThis lesson is also a scaffold to the larger project that begins after this lesson which includes several tasks that are also a part of this lesson such as, annotating an article, answering questions, and forming an opinion using the article as evidence. Students may need support with these processes during this lesson so they are able to complete the following lesson independently. It is especially important that students use marking the text strategies to help them comprehend and synthesize the information from their article, because they will need to do this in the next lesson as well. \r\n",

Then I have 2 left. I flip up a one in the 2's position. This gives me the binary number \"1010\", which means 10 in decimal.<br><br>If students are having a difficult time understanding the rules of the system, remind them of the concept of place value and relate to base 10. <br><br>| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click through animation to see answers.**\r\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-1---Digital-Information15.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black\"} | **Say:** Let's continue to practice with our own two number bases, decimal and binary. After you finish each of the four parts of the Activity Guide, I want you to check your work with your partner. Feel free to use your Flippy Do as you work. <br><br>**Distribute:** Activity Guide <br><br>**Note:** Encourage students to use their Flippy Do as a resource. <br><br><ul><li> **Challenge 1 - All 4-bit Numbers: **Students should produce all binary numbers with a length of 4 bits, from 0000 to 1111. They should see that all odd numbers end in 1 and even numbers end in 0. Students may also notice that the binary digits increasingly “roll-over” to 1’s (from right to left) as numbers become larger and larger.</li><li> **Challenge 2 - Binary Numbers with Exactly One 1:**  The goal here is for students to systematically find all binary numbers that have all zeros, except for one bit. Students should notice that the resulting decimal values are all powers of 2.</li><li>**Challenge 3 - Conversion Practice:** This section gives students more practice converting between number bases. The last two decimal numbers, 256 and 513, are too big to represent using the Flippy Do, however students should make the connection that more bits could be added to the left of the Flippy Do using increasing powers of 2.</li><li> **Challenge 4 - Putting it all Together:**   The last four questions on the Activity Guide ask students to apply their understanding to new situations. The first two questions ask students to describe what happens to the value when 0’s are added to the left or right of a binary number. The last two questions ask students to think about how many bits are required to represent specific values in binary.</li></ul> <br><br> **Note:** As you circulate, take an opportunity to be a Lead Learner. Help students discover the items below using the suggested questions:<br><br><ul><li>**Reading a number vs. Placing a Number:** Do we fill in the places on the Flippy Do starting on the left or right? Does it matter? (Yes. If we have a 5-bit number, we actually use the 5 bits on the far right. If we were to use the bits on the far left, this changes the value of the number. This is similar to adding more zeros to a decimal number.)</li><li>**Highest value possible with a given number of bits:** What is the largest number we can make with 4 bits? Is the last number we can make always odd? (A meaningful pattern is that we can count as high as one less than the next bit on the left. If we have four bits, we can count up to the number 15, because the next bit has a value of 16.) </li><li>**Number of numbers we can make:** How many total unique numbers are possible with 4 bits? (This is a base 2 number system. With each new bit, we double the amount of unique numbers we can make. With four bits, we can make the decimal numbers 0 to 15 (0000 to 1111), for a total of 16 unique numbers.)</li></ul>    |"

With ten digits on our hands and feet, the decimal (base 10) number base was natural for humans to develop.  The ten symbols we use for this number base are the digits 0-9.   For a computer, however, it makes more sense that data be represented in binary (base 2), as this can easily be interpreted with electrical switches set to two states: ON or OFF.  The two symbols we use for this number base are the digits 0 and 1.\r\n\r\nBoth number bases take advantage of the concept of place value.  In decimal, numbers are composed of powers of 10, increasing in value from right to left.  Binary is similar, however we use powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.).  Expressed in binary, these values are 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, and so on.  These make up the incremental place values in the binary number system.\r\n\r\n**Why Binary?**\r\n\r\nStudents will see in a later lesson how computers use binary numbers as a representation of electrical signals on a wire. The wire is always set to one of two different options: on or off. Off can be reprsented with a 0 and on with a 1. \r\n"

To form a value, flip the flaps up or down at the bottom of the device to create a sequence of zeros and ones.

Using language in a clear way can be tricky for this lesson because “decimal” can mean different things to students.  For example, students frequently refer to a number as a “decimal” if it isn’t a whole number (ex. Students may call “1.23” a “decimal”) but here we want to stick with students thinking as a decimal number to be a “base 10” number.  Therefore, we avoid using the word “decimal point” in the Flippy Do Pro and instead talk about the fractional part of the number and the whole part of the number.   The purpose of doing this is to maintain using \"decimal\" to only refer to a \"base 10\" number.  For your own personal knowledge, you can read more about \"decimal points\" and \"binary points\" on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_point).\n"

It's a term used to mean something with continuous representation - such as a picture you draw on a piece of paper. Each pencil line smoothly connects to the next, no matter how much you zoomed in on the picture with a magnifying glass. \r\n\r\nWhen we represent an analog image digitally, we will have to make some choices on how to sample the image to get the smoothest representation possible while keeping in mind the number of bits it takes to build that image. \r\n\r\nWhat does it mean to sample? We are choosing how small to make section of the picture we look at when deciding whether to make it black or white. The smaller the sample, the more pixels required to represent that image. Larger samples require less pixels, but the image can become blurry. \r\n\r\nTry it out yourself!",

These questions are mapped to topics with each topic having a handful of questions available.\r\n\r\nThe College Board has a few strict guidelines about how topic questions can be used. In particular, students may not receive a grade based on performance on topic questions nor can they be used for teacher evaluation. Beyond these requirements, however, they are primarily intended to formatively assess student progress and learning as they prepare for the end of course exam.\r\n\r\nWithin our own course we recommend that you use them in a variety of ways:\r\n\r\n* Throughout the unit assign topic questions to students related to the topics students are learning about that day or that week\r\n* Prior to the unit assessment assign topic questions to help students practice and prepare for the summative assessment\r\n* After the unit assessment use these topic questions to help students track their progress towards preparation for the AP assessment\r\n\r\n![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/topics1.png)\r\n\r\nClick for more info: [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dqYF5u0AULjw049gaCwAP34ZSe0VuEWbAjWoH1-YMW0/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n"
