In this first lesson, students get an overview of what data is and how it is used to solve problems. Students start off with a brief discussion to come to a common understanding of data. They then split into groups and use a data set to make a series of meal recommendations for people with various criteria. Each group has the choices of meals represented in a different way (pictures, recipes, menu, nutrition) that gives an advantage for one of the recommendations. Afterward, groups compare their responses and discuss how the different representations of the meal data affected how the students were able to solve the different problems and see that the same objects can be represented in a number of different ways.\n\n**Question of the Day:** How does data affect decisions we make every day?\n",

They begin by brainstorming all the different systems they already use to represent yes-no responses and then move on to create a system that can represent any letter in the alphabet using only a single stack of cards. The cards used have one of 6 different possible drawings (6 animals, 6 colors, etc.) and so to represent the entire alphabet students will need to work with their groups to use patterns of multiple cards to represent each letter. Students create messages with their systems and exchange them with other groups to ensure the system worked as intended. In the wrap-up discussion, the class reviews the pros and cons of the different systems, discussing commonalities between working systems and recognizing that there are many possible solutions to this problem and what's important is that everyone uses the same arbitrary system to communicate.\n\n**Question of the Day:** How can we create a system for representing information?\n",

Students will first write a short description of their perfect day and then review with a partner to identify the key pieces of information they think a computer could capture. As a class, students will decide how a punch card of bytes of information will be interpreted to represent those pieces of information. Students will then use the ASCII, binary number, and image formats they have learned to represent their perfect days and then trade punch cards and try to decode what the other student's perfect day is like. This lesson forces students to grapple with some of the challenges of representing information in a computer since computers are good at representing _some_ kinds of information like numbers or characters, but this forces students to represent information in ways that might not always capture the full analog experience of an object or event. \n\n**Question of the Day:** How can I represent complex information using binary systems?\n",

For their image representation, they may wonder whether it is even useful to interpret the binary sequences as numbers. In the end, the purpose of defining all data as numbers is less about the \"reality\" of what the ones and zeros represent, and more about how binary is traditionally interpreted.\n\n- For the second question, allow students to think of different ways that the computer would distinguish between different types of data. While it's not necessary for students to come up with any specific answer, challenge them in any ways that involve human interpretation of context, such as knowing that a name is most likely text and age is most likely a number.
