This opens up opportunities for online meanness to occur.\r\n\r\n**P**: Pause and think\r\n\r\n* _Would it be helpful to talk to the person who was being mean?_\r\n\r\n**Ask**: _What advice would you give Jada to respond to this situation?

If Jada and Michael are good friends, Jada may want to tell Michael how his actions made her feel, after she gets advice from an adult. If Michael continues to be mean to her, she should immediately tell an adult.\r\n\r\n**Ask**: _Which of the 4 rules in S-T-O-P do you think is the most important? Why?_\r\n\r\nGive students a moment to think and then informally poll the class.

Here are some modifications that you can make:\n\n- One arrow corresponds to one movement:\n\t- When a cup is removed from the stack, it returns to table-level before moving.\n\t- Students need to use multiple \"up\" arrows to lift the cup multiple levels.\n\t- Students need to use multiple \"down\" arrows to lower the cups multiple levels.\n\t- Students need to use the \"back\" arrows to get back to the cup stack.\n\n"

Explain to the class that these will be the only four actions that they can use for this exercise. For this task, they will instruct their “robot” friend to build a specific cup stack using only the commands listed on the key.\n\n**Model:** In order to explain how the instructions are intended to work, model for the class how to create and follow an algorithm for replicating a simple pattern. Place a single stack of cups in front of you to start.\n\n**Display:** Hold up the pattern you plan to model. A simple three cup pattern is a great place to start.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/image_29uZ9YD.png\" style=\"max-width: 300px; margin: 10px;\">\n\n**Prompt:** Ask the class what the first instruction should be, using _only the four instructions allowed_. The first move should be to \"pick up cup.\" If students suggest something else from the list, perform that action and allow them to see their error.  If they suggest something not from the list, make a clear malfunction reaction and let them know that the command is not understood.\n\nWith cup in hand, ask the class to continue giving you instructions until the first cup is placed. This is a great place to clarify that \"step forward\" and \"step backward\" each imply moving half a cup width. See the image below for reference.\n\n![3 cup pattern](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/image_d0bGRBl.png)\n\nContinue asking for instructions from the classroom until you have completed the entire design.\n\nOnce your stack is complete, point out that they just gave you a list of steps for completing a task. That's an algorithm.  Algorithms are great for sharing ideas, but spelling them out word by word can take a long time. That's what the symbols are for!  When you change an algorithm into symbols that a robot (or computer) understands, that's called programming.\n\nAsk the class to help you write the \"program\" for that first move by changing the text into an arrow. Then work with them to write down the rest of the moves necessary to complete the pattern. Depending on the confidence of your students, you might switch back and forth frequently between acting as the \"robot\" and writing down the code, or you might push them to write the whole program before you will implement it. One possible solution looks like this:\n\n![3 cup solution](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/image_xmBkoQZ_0OrQqsy.png)\n\n**Volunteer:** Once the class has completed the model program, ask one of the students to come up and act as the \"robot\" to ensure that the program really works. Encourage them to say the instructions out loud as they \"run\" the code."

Have each pair (not group) choose which design they would like their robots to do. Try to push for an easier design for the first time, then have them choose a more complex design later on. Encourage pairs to keep their choice secret from the other half of their group.\n\n**Discuss:** Give each pair time to discuss how the stack should be built, using only the provided symbols. Make sure each group writes down the \"program\" somewhere for the \"robot\" to read later.\n\n\n**Do:** Once both of the group's pairs have completed their programs, they can take turns being \"robots\" for each other by following the instructions the other pair wrote. Encourage students to watch their \"robot\" closely to ensure that they are following instructions. If a student sees a bug and raises their hand, have the robot finish the instructions to the best of their ability. Afterward, have the students discuss the potential bug and come up with solutions. Continue repeating until the stack is built properly.\n\n**Circulate:** Look for groups who are trying to take shortcuts by adding extra things (like numbers) to their code.  Praise them for their ingenuity, but remind them that for this exercise, the robots do not understand *anything* but the provided symbols.  If you like, you can hint that they should save their brilliant solution for the next time they play this game, since they might get the chance to use their invention soon!\n\n**Iterate:** Depending on the time available, mix up the pairs and give them a chance to do a different pattern.

        "description": "\n**Circulate:** Teachers play a vital role in computer science education and supporting a collaborative and vibrant classroom environment. During online activities, the role of the teacher is primarily one of encouragement and support. Online lessons are meant to be student-centered, so teachers should avoid stepping in when students get stuck. Some ideas on how to do this are: \n\n - Utilize pair programming whenever possible during the activity.\n - Encourage students with questions/challenges to start by asking their partner.\n - Unanswered questions can be escalated to a nearby group, who might already know the solution.\n - Remind students to use the debugging process before you approach.\n - Have students describe the problem that they’re seeing. What is it supposed to do? What does it do? What does that tell you?\n - Remind frustrated students that frustration is a step on the path to learning, and that persistence will pay off.\n - If a student is still stuck after all of this, ask leading questions to get the student to spot an error on their own.\n\n**Discuss:** After providing students with end-of-class warnings, grab everyone's attention and get them to reflect on the experiences that they just had.\n\n - _Did anyone feel frustrated during any of the puzzles?_\n - _Did anyone notice the need to be persistent?_\n\n**Transition:** Have students grab their reflection journals and take a moment to reflect on the lesson for themselves."

Persistence works best when you try things many different ways, many different times.\n\n**Say:** _**Debugging** is a process. First, you must recognize that there is an error in your program. You then work through the program step by step to find the error. Try the first step, did it work? Then the second, how about now? If you make sure that everything is working line by line, then when you get to the place that your code isn't doing what it's supposed to, you know that you've found a bug. Once you've discovered your bug, you can work to fix (or \"debug\") it!_\n\nIf you think it will build excitement in the class you can introduce the character of today's puzzles, *Scrat* from _\"Ice Age\"_.

We suggest:\n\t- Counting to 10\n\t- Singing “Old MacDonald”\n- Practice until students seem comfortable with the idea that each button press causes them to perform an action."

Students will become Game Designers as they create create and test a game. Students will also record scores, make observations, create a bar graph, analyze the results and justify the changes they would make to their game.\n\n*Standards Addressed:*\n\n- **2.MD.D.10:**  Draw a picture graph and a bar graph (with single-unit scale) to represent a data set with up to four categories. \n\n- **K-2 ETS1-1:** Ask questions, make observations, and gather information about a situation people want to change to define a simple problem that can be solved through the development of a new or improved object or tool.\n\n- **K-2 ETS1-3:** Analyze data from tests of an object or tool to determine if it works as intended to compare the strengths and weaknesses of how each performs.\n\n\n\n"

This can be done in many ways, but here are a few:\r\n\r\n* **Public Demo**: Select a few exemplary volunteers to briefly demo their projects in front of the class. As they do so, have them touch on what the planning-to-coding experience was like for them, including ideas they'd still like to implement. \r\n* **Pair Playtesting**: Have students or groups pair up and playtest each other's projects. As they do, ask them to provide positive and constructive feedback to each other. The benefit here is that students will have the opportunity to provide and respond to feedback in a smaller setting. \r\n* **Gallery Walk**: Ensure all students have their projects ready for testing. Have students move \"musical chairs\"-style to another computer and playtest the project there for a few minutes, until they receive a signal from you to move to another computer. Repeat this every few minutes. While there is less opportunity for structured communication here, this ensures students get to demo as many of their peers' projects as possible.",
