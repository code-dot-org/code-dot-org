This is known as “space ice cream.”\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: Show “How to Make Space Ice Cream” slide\n\n**Say:** You put regular ice cream into a machine, something happens inside the machine and space ice cream comes out! What is going on in that machine?\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: Show “Machine Explanation” slide\n\n**Say:** The machine freeze dries the ice cream. It makes the ice cream soooooooo cold that all of the water in it evaporates and it becomes lightweight, dried and ready for space travel. \n\n\n**Discussion Goal:** Students should understand that a function machine takes in an input, does something to it, and computes the output. The space ice cream machine doesn’t input or output any numbers but rather takes in a food and outputs a variation of that food. This is done intentionally to indicate that in computer science a function has a purpose other than just solving mathematical problems.\n\n**Do This:** Go through the slides and read them aloud, or have a student volunteer read the text aloud. Make sure that students understand that a process is taking place in the machine that we cannot see. \n\n",

Depending on the age and ability of your students, you might consider formally breaking your class into pairs to complete the tutorial using pair programming.\n- **Read the Instructions:** The instructions are bulleted points on how to complete the level. If a student feels stuck, ask them to read the instructions out loud to you and ask them to repeat back what the instructions say in their own words. \n  - <img src=\"https://images.code.org/5b99c663ad6632fe64c9da69d6805c2b-text-to-speech.PNG\" style=\"height: 25px;\"> Students can also click on this text-to-speech icon to hear the instructions read aloud.\n- <img src=\"https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/hint.png\" style=\"height: 35px;\"> **Look for hints**: Most levels include at least one hint with more explicit details about how to pass the level. \n- **Celebrate bugs:** Getting a bug in your code is a natural part of the coding process. If the program isn’t doing what they expected, ask the student to first tell you what they want to happen, click run to observe what is actually happening, then find the place in their code that caused the discrepancy. Remember to celebrate finding bugs and fixing bugs. Getting a bug means students are doing a great job building a more complex program. \n"
