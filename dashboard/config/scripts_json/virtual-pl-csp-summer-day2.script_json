Each pencil line smoothly connects to the next, no matter how much you zoomed in on the picture with a magnifying glass. \r\n\r\nWhen we represent an analog image digitally, we will have to make some choices on how to sample the image to get the smoothest representation possible while keeping in mind the number of bits it takes to build that image. \r\n\r\nWhat does it mean to sample? We are choosing how small to make section of the picture we look at when deciding whether to make it black or white. The smaller the sample, the more pixels required to represent that image. Larger samples require less pixels, but the image can become blurry. \r\n\r\nTry it out yourself!",

A little easier to decide whether to make a square black or white.\n* **Cons:**  More bits are needed.  Took longer to enter in the widget.  Still doesn’t look exactly like the analog image.

        "description": "Thank you for sharing.  It looks like there are several advantages and disadvantages when it comes to sampling more frequently by using smaller squares.  We get a better approximation of the analog image when we do more frequent sampling and it was a little easier to decide whether each square should be set to black or white.  However, it took longer and we needed a lot more bits.  We still got an image that didn’t represent the image accurately enough, though.\r\n\r\nFortunately, a computer does this process much more quickly than we can, and it can store thousands or even millions of bits to represent an analog image.\r\n\r\nBy this point, we've used bits to represent numbers, text, and images. The same sequence of bits can represent different types of data depending on the context. It all comes down to 0s and 1s!",

However, it is also reasonable to ask groups to do a second ‘easy’ text once they’re satisfied with this one\r\n\r\n**Priorities:** It’s not necessary for all groups to pick the same texts, nor is it important to find the very ‘best’ compressions. Instead, students should focus on the qualities that they think make some texts ‘easier’ or more ‘difficult’ than others. You can emphasize this with the questions you ask as you circulate to groups: “What made you pick this for your ‘easy’ text? What made you pick this for your ‘difficult’ text?”\r\n"
