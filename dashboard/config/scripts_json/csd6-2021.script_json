Students learn techniques to make the apps they write more flexible by modifying design elements through code instead of always relying on design mode. Using the Circuit Playground, they then explore different approaches to taking input and producing output using hardware. By the end of this chapter, students will design a develop a game that uses physical hardware for input and output."

From there we introduce the for loop, first simply as a way to repeat a block of code, and then as a way to run code on each element of an array. By the end of this chapter students will have explored all components of their boards while learning to structure their code using arrays, loops, and parametric functions. In the final two lessons students have an opportunity to dig into building physical prototypes using their boards."

This command can be used to set the content and properties of various UI elements, allowing students to write programs that update information on a single screen, instead of manually creating duplicate screens. In this lesson students build up simple apps that only require a single screen, the content of which is changed using [`setProperty()`(#fff176)](/docs/applab/setProperty/).",
        "purpose": "This lesson allows students some time to get back into programming with App Lab before introducing the Circuit Playground, but also introduces the useful concept of a _setter_. In Unit 4, students primarily used [`setScreen()`(#fff176)](/docs/applab/setScreen/) to make their apps respond to user interaction. While this is a simple and useful technique, it can lead to a lot of duplication of content across multiple screens. By using _setters_, and later _getters_, students can write apps that actually change the content on a single screen, by showing and hiding or changing the content or look of various elements.\r\n\r\nOnce students have learned about using getters and setters with UI elements, encourage them to think critically about when to use a separate screen in the design phase of an app. If screens are more alike than different, it might be more effective to just change the elements on screen in reaction to input instead of duplicating content across multiple screens.

        "overview": "In this lesson students will use the buzzer to its full extent by producing sounds, notes, and songs with the buzzer. Students start with a short review of the buzzer's frequency and duration parameters, then move on to the concept of notes.  Notes allow students to constrain themselves to frequencies that are used in Western music and provide a layer of abstraction that helps them to understand which frequencies might sound good together.  Once students are able to play notes on the buzzer, they use arrays to hold and play sequences of notes, forming simple songs.",
        "purpose": "This lesson allows students to get more creative with the buzzer by introducing the concept of a \"note\" and by using arrays to hold sequential collections of notes.  Using notes rather than frequencies provides a layer of abstraction that makes it easier for students to identify sounds that can be used to make music.  Arrays provide a way to group together sounds in sequence, so that they can be played as music.  Using the `playNotes` block to iterate over an array of notes provides a conceptual foundation for working with `for` loops in the next lesson.",

In this lesson, students learn the basics of how a _for loop_ can be used to repeat code, and then combine it with what they've already learned about arrays to write programs that process all elements in an array. Students use for loops to go through each element in a list one at a time without having to write code for each element. Towards the end of the lesson students will apply this with the `colorLed` list on the board to create an app that changes all of the LEDs each time a button is clicked.",
        "purpose": "As students start using arrays more frequently, a common pattern emerges wherein you want to run some code on each element of an array. While _for loops_ are a generally useful structure for repeating code, they are a particularly useful for iterating over an array. In this lesson we build on the understanding of arrays that students have developed in the last two lessons by introducing the _for loop_, which combines a variable, the counter pattern, and a conditional all in a single construct.",

Although students have seen functions with parameters earlier in the unit, this is the first time that they are expected to define and call their own.

How is computer technology changing this field, what are some of the problems that people are trying to solve with technology?\r\n    * Second, identify a handful of innovative devices within this topic. Students should focus on finding _hardware_ devices that demonstrate unique or novel _form factors_. That is to say, computers that don't _look_ like computers.\r\n* **Send to Code Studio for resource links**: On Code Studio we have compiled more detailed descriptions of the topics as well as couple of recommended sites to learn more about each topic. Use this as a jumping off point for student research."

More frivolous wearables or digital art installations may be more concerned with personal expression than solving a specific problem.\r\n* **What Is Innovative About It?:** Encourage students to refer back to the earlier discussion about innovation for this. It can also be useful to compare against other devices found during the research phase.\r\n* **How Do You Interact With It?:** Ask students to think back to the _Input, Output, Storage, Processing_ model that was introduced way back in Unit 1. The goal here is to identify specifically the Inputs and Outputs provided by a given device - the more specific these are, the more easily students will be able to connect elements of the Circuit Playground to these devices.\r\n* **How Could You Improve It?:** Feel free to make this as realistic or aspirational as you like. The goal here is just to get students thinking about how they might develop an innovation of their own by using an existing product as a jumping off point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Share:** Give groups a minute each to share their findings.

This represents the current state of that input.\r\n* Whenever the **Program** reaches an input checking command (`inputOne()`, `inputTwo()`, or `inputThree()`), the **Program** asks to see that inputs card.\r\n* If the value of the card shown matches the associated conditional, the **Program** performs the action(s) inside the conditional.\r\n\r\nAfter groups have run the program a few times and seem to understand how it works, have them switch up roles so that each student gets a chance to be the **Program**.\r\n\r\n#### Version B: Input Events\r\n\r\nThis time around, instead of constantly asking for input in a loop, the **Program** will assign each **Input** an Event to watch for. In the context of this activity, an Event is either a red or black card, but in a program that Event could be a click on a button, movement of the mouse, press of a key, or more. This is a simplified model for the way input is handled in App Lab.\r\n\r\n**Rules for Version B:**\r\n\r\n* Each **Input** draws a card from the deck at a rate of roughly one per second.\r\n* The **Program** reads each line of code aloud.\r\n* When the **Program** reaches an [`onEvent`(#fff176)](/docs/applab/onEvent/) command, they tell the specified **Input** which Event to watch for, and what the Response should be.\r\n* When assigned an Event, the **Input** writes down the details in their _Events to Watch_ table.\r\n* Every time an **Input** draws a card, they check to see if it matches one of the Events in their table. If it does, they tell the **Program** to perform the Response.\r\n\r\nThere are a few important simplifications that are made in this model to minimize the number of roles and rules:\r\n\r\n* This model implies that Inputs are actually watching for Events on their own. In reality, an Event Handler running in the background watching for the specified event.\r\n* In this model the **Input** tells the **Program** what actions to take. In reality, when an Event Handler is triggered, the Program goes to that portion of their code and runs everything in the function."

Just like any other piece of information, it needs to be assigned to a variable for a programmer to find it again.

Music is usually written down as specific notes on a scale, which makes it much easier to see which sounds will go well together.
