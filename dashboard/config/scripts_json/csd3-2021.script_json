In this lesson students begin by playing a game on Game Lab where the code is hidden. They discuss what they think the sprites, variables, and functions would need to be to make the game. They are then given a completed project guide which shows one way to implement the game. Students are then walked through this process through a series of levels.

The primary goal of this activity is to broaden students' perspectives about how programming can be used to make fun or entertaining things. Some of the fields that students could research (such as art, animation, and games) can be directly connected to programs they will write later in this unit, while others may serve more as an inspiration for how the skills that they learn here may be applied in different domains.\r\n\r\n#### Topics\r\n\r\nIn the activity guide there are a number of potential fields for research. These specific fields were chosen to go along with resources that are provided on Code Studio, but you can have students look into other fields if they wish."

How is computer technology changing this field, and what are some of the problems that people are trying to solve with technology?\r\n  * Second, identify some interesting applications of CS or facts to share. What are some cool things that people are doing in this field that make use of CS?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Interesting Information\r\n\r\nOnce groups have learned a bit about how CS is used in their chosen field, they can complete the second page of the activity guide, which asks them to do the following:\r\n\r\n* **What Problem Does It Solve?:** \"Problem\" in this context can be fairly broad. It might be simplifying an otherwise laborious or complex task, doing things that wouldn't otherwise be possible, or any number of things that make this form of entertainment more accessible to end users.\r\n* **How is it an Improvement?:** This could be tightly coupled with the answer to the previous question. Push students to consider how their form of entertainment was created before programming was prevalent.\r\n* **An Interesting Fact or Use:** Share something fun or interesting about how CS is used in this field.\r\n* **An Open Question:** It's likely that students come away with more questions than answers after just some quick research. Encourage them to reflect on what they don't yet know, and what questions they'd still like answered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Share:** Give groups a minute each to share their findings.",

Students should not look at each other's papers.\r\n\r\n**Set Up:** In this activity, students will try to recreate images based on a partner's directions. The student who is drawing will use the shape drawing tool on Game Lab to draw the shapes. Students should keep their drawings hidden from one another throughout the activity. While completing a drawing the instruction-giver should also not be able to see the computer screen.\r\n\r\n**Drawing 1:** Each member of the pair should complete their first drawing, taking turns giving instructions and using the tool. These drawings do not feature any overlapping shapes, but students may need to grapple with the fact that circles are drawn from the middle and squares from the top left corner. Additionally, students may just struggle with the direction of the Y-axis.\r\n\r\n**Discuss:** Give pairs a couple of minutes to discuss any common issues they're noticing in trying to complete their drawings.\r\n\r\n**Drawing 2:** Each member of the pair should describe their second drawing to their partner. These drawings feature overlapping shapes and so students will need to consider the order in which shapes are being placed as well as when they should change the color of the pen."

Computer screens come in all different shapes and sizes, as does the content we show on them. We need to agree on one point where all the content can grow from. Since we read starting at the top left corner, the grid on a computer screen starts at the top left corner as well. There's also the benefit of not having to use any negative numbers to talk about locations on the screen. Don't worry if this flipped grid is a little tricky still. We'll have plenty more time to work on it in coming lessons.",

The most important aspect for students to understand is that sprites allow them to organize a lot of information about something that they want to draw to the screen.\n\nStudents should make the connection between properties and variables, that both hold information that their program needs to run. Properties are accessed through their sprites, and Game Lab sprites already have specific properties that are automatically created when students create each sprite, such as x position, height, and rotation.\n\nSprites solve the problem of organizing a lot of information about how something should be drawn to a screen. Rather than creating new variables to hold all of that information, sprites use properties to hold all of the information about one thing that is drawn to the screen.\n\n**Content Corner:** The sprite is a type of data called an object. While we aren't yet explicitly introducing the concept of objects, students do need to understand that a sprite is a different type of value from the ones we've seen before, one that can hold references to many more values."

Additionally, students can use the drawing tools to modify the images they have chosen from the library or uploaded.\n\n**Misconception Alert!**\nMany students may now confuse the concepts of a sprite, its animation, and the image that it draws to the screen. In the next few lessons, watch out for this misconception, and reinforce the idea that a sprite's animation is just one of its properties, the one that controls what image is drawn to the screen. Remind students that a single sprite may have different animations throughout the course of the program, just as other properties can change, and that two or more sprites might share the same animation."

You do not actually need to call the function yourself.\r\n* The \"frames\" in Game Lab can be thought of as transparency sheets. Unless you draw a background, then all your new shapes or sprites will simply appear on top of your old ones.\r\n* You should only have one draw loop in your program.\r\n"

They should understand that the counter pattern allows the programmer to update the value of a variable in a pattern that counts up (or down) on every iteration of the draw loop. This can be used for many different things, such as spinning, growing, shrinking, or timers, but it's most often used to move sprites across the screen.\n\nWhen a sprite's x or y property is updated in a counter pattern, its position changes in a consistent way over time, causing it to move across the screen. Students should be able to explain that movement in an animation is just a change in position, and that changing a sprite's x position will cause it to move horizontally, and changing a sprite's y position will cause it to move vertically."

The more formal way to say this is that Boolean expressions evaluate to either true or false. That means that when the computer processes a Boolean expression, it checks to see whether the expression describes a situation that is true or false, and then uses the value of either true or false wherever the expression is found.\n\nSome examples of Boolean expressions that evaluate to true are `3 > 1` and `4 <= 7`, but press students to think of expressions that might be better represented by variables, such as `studentAge < 70` or `sizeOfClass > 2`.\n\nSome examples of Boolean expressions that evaluate to false are `4 == 7`, `schoolName == \"Hogwarts\"`, and `currentYear < 1000`."

If students are having trouble of thinking of situations in which the velocity block provides a big advantage, assure them that they will tackle some problems in the coming lesson that they will need this block for.\n\nAs students give you examples, try to elicit answers that use both positive and negative numbers, and that use the x and y positions as well as sprite rotation."

Ensure that one partner has taken Version A and the other has taken Version B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEach student will have a line on which to draw two squares.  The student chooses the location and the size of each of the squares, and then records the information about the squares in a table. They then switch tables (not drawings) and try to determine whether or not the two sprites are touching based on the width of each sprite and the distance between them.\r\n\r\nThe math to determine whether the sprites are touching is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Subtract the x (or y) positions of the sprites to find the distance between their centers.\r\n2. Divide the width (or height) of each square by 2 to get the distance from the center to the edge.\r\n3. If the distance between the centers of the sprites is greater than the sum of the distances from their centers to their edges, the sprites are not touching.\r\n4. If the distance between the centers of the sprites is equal to the sum of the distances from their centers to their edges, the sprites are barely touching.\r\n5. If the distance between the centers of the sprites is less than the sum of the distances from their centers to their edges, the sprites are overlapping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Circulate**: Support students as they complete the worksheet.  If students are not sure how to determine whether the sprites are touching, encourage them to use one of the ideas on the board. Remind them that they are not being graded on whether they are right or wrong, but on their ability to use the problem-solving process. If any students are finished early, challenge them to find a method that will work for sprites anywhere on the grid, not just on the same line.\r\n\r\n**Share**: After students have all had a chance to test their solutions, ask them to share what they discovered."

If the bunny could move diagonally, then the code would be even more complicated.\n\n**Level 5:** This level does not ask students to fix the bug in the program, which must be done in the animation tab. In order to make the collision work properly, students will need to crop the empty space around the visible part of the picture. The easiest way to do this is to click once on the \"crop\" icon in the animation tab, which will tightly crop to the smallest rectangle around the visible parts of the picture. Students may also use the rectangular select tool to specify what should be cropped away."
