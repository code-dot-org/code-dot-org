        "description": "This unit assessment is a semester capstone assessment that has a five-day, three-day, and one-day version. The five-day modification achieves the targeted learning objects and goals while giving students additional methods to implement and additional time to develop their project. The three-day version offers the same lesson plans, but students will implement one method and call two existing methods. The three-day is the version that is on Code Studio. If there is not enough time for the three-day project, a one-day option is available. In the one-day option, direct students to develop their program on Code Studio in Lesson 13 to submit their project. While the one-day option covers the learning objectives and goals, it shortens planning and reflection time. Consider this tradeoff when deciding which version to use.\n\n**5-Day Version**\n* [**Lesson Plan**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pPi-PsDcawjSVOyq1c-xTc1nA9iygHy6FzaXwmNfHoA/edit?usp=sharing)\n* [**Project Planning Guide**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dg6PI6YZbSxWyOCenXGtXYBQgoxlehvBVc6piiESg5Q/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**1-Day Version**\n* [**Lesson Plan**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EoFAXcoXPCxS_tMPPPLxBb_G0cRS37Ct8rAb0fe99zQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n* [**Project Planning Guide**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kmy9vtHS0nzmNQ1Ls-ffU5HMsYlMI5yr9JbAY_RuTeY/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nIn the three-day version, the unit assessment project assesses proficiency in the knowledge and skills developed in this unit. Students will have three class periods to plan and create the program. Student participation in planning and feedback activities to improve their programs and solve problems. They will also reinforce software development practices and their self-image as a software engineer. Lessons 11, 12, and 13 collectively include instructions for the three-day project."
