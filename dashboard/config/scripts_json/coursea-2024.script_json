If you're not sure of a good one to explore, try one of the following:\n\n-   [The San Diego Zoo](http://kids.sandiegozoo.org/)\n-   [National Geographic Kids Explore the World](https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/explore/countries/)\n\n**Ask**: *What's the first rule before turning on a device or opening up a website or app?*\n\nInvite students to share, reminding them that they must always ask for permission from an adult before using a device or visiting a website or app.\n\n**Explore** the website you selected with your class, allowing students to choose pages and activities that are most interesting to them. As you go through the site, point out how students are following the other two safety rules for going online: only talking to people they know, and sticking to places that are just right for them.\n\nNote: If you are in the computer lab or have enough devices in your classroom, have students do the explorations individually or in pairs.\n\n**Ask** students what they learned on their internet field trip. Also ask: *How did you follow the three safety rules when you visited the site?*"

Students will need to get the flurbs to the fruit on each card, using the arrows provided.\n\n**Model:**  Select one of the intermediate maps from the Happy Maps Cards worksheet (e.g., #3). Display it for the class and work through the puzzle together.\n\nHave students look at the puzzle, then think-pair-share their solution for how they would get the flurb to the fruit.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: Show “Decompose it!” slide\n\nRemind students to break each puzzle down into smaller steps.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: Show \"Get the Flurb to the banana\" slide\n\n**Think:**  This flurb needs to take two steps to get to the fruit. Work with your elbow partner to decide what you think those two steps are.\n\n**Pair:**  Have students discuss with neighbors for about 90 seconds.\n\n**Share:** Ask a few students to describe their algorithm to the class. Move your finger along the displayed map as the students read their steps. Once you have a solution, ask if anyone else came up with a different idea that also works. \n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: Show \"Using Symbols\" slide\n\nNow, share with the students that the magic step of changing an algorithm into a program happens when the code is written down using symbols.  Do the students see any symbols on the display?\n\n**Think:** Challenge students to encode the algorithm that they came up with before into symbols, and to write those symbols down in their journals (or on a piece of paper.)\n\n**Pair:** Once students have written down their symbols, ask them to swap with a partner to see if they can follow each others' instructions.\n\n**Share:** Ask for volunteers to come draw their arrows on the board. If the original code doesn't work, spend some time debugging as a class. Students should be familiar with the idea of \"debugging\" from previous lessons, so be sure to use the vocabulary to get them comfortable with it.\n\nOnce the code has been successfully written on the board, congratulate the class on writing their first program together!"

During online activities, the role of the teacher is primarily one of encouragement and support. Online lessons are meant to be student-centered, so teachers should avoid stepping in when students get stuck. Some ideas on how to do this are: \n\n - Utilize pair programming whenever possible during the activity.\n - Encourage students with questions/challenges to start by asking their partner.\n - Unanswered questions can be escalated to a nearby group, who might already know the solution.\n - Remind students to use the debugging process before you approach.\n - Have students describe the problem that they’re seeing. What is it supposed to do? What does it do? What does that tell you?\n - Remind frustrated students that frustration is a step on the path to learning, and that persistence will pay off.\n - If a student is still stuck after all of this, ask leading questions to get the student to spot an error on their own.\n\n",

During online activities, the role of the teacher is primarily one of encouragement and support. Online lessons are meant to be student-centered, so teachers should avoid stepping in when students get stuck. Some ideas on how to do this are: \n\n - Utilize ***Pair Programming**  - student video whenever possible.\n - Encourage students with questions/challenges to start by asking their partner.\n - Unanswered questions can be escalated to a nearby group, who might already know the solution.\n - Remind students to use the debugging process before you approach.\n - Have students describe the problem that they’re seeing. What is it supposed to do? What does it do? What does that tell you?\n - Remind frustrated students that frustration is a step on the path to learning, and that persistence will pay off.\n - If a student is still stuck after all of this, ask leading questions to get the student to spot an error on their own."

        "description": "**Circulate:** Teachers play a vital role in computer science education and supporting a collaborative and vibrant classroom environment. During online activities, the role of the teacher is primarily one of encouragement and support. Online lessons are meant to be student-centered, so teachers should avoid stepping in when students get stuck. Some ideas on how to do this are: \n\n - Utilize ***Pair Programming** whenever possible\n - Encourage students with questions/challenges to start by asking their partner\n - Unanswered questions can be escalated to a nearby group, who might already know the solution\n - Remind students to use the debugging process before you approach\n - Have students describe the problem that they’re seeing. What is it supposed to do? What does it do? What does that tell you?\n - Remind frustrated students that frustration is a step on the path to learning, and that persistence will pay off.\n - If a student is still stuck after all of this, ask leading questions to get the student to spot an error on their own."

Give them 3-4 sounds and ask what buttons they would need to press to get the sounds to play in that order. For example:\n\t- What buttons would you need to press to get \"Boom! Boom! Yeah!\"?\n- Get the class started on a planned task before interrupting them again with the buttons. We suggest:\n\t- Counting to 10\n\t- Singing “Old MacDonald”\n- Once their plan is underway, interject button presses sporadically.\n- Continue the blend until they understand the difference between actions that are guided by a plan and those that are event driven.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: Show “Decompose it!” slide\n\nRemind students to break each puzzle down into smaller steps."
