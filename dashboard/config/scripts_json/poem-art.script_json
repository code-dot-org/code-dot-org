        "overview": "In this CS and ELA integrated lesson, students will animate a poem with code to illustrate the mood of a poem. During this introductory coding activity, students will read and detect the mood of a poem. Then, they will find corresponding effects and images to help illustrate the poem’s mood. Last, students will use events (code) to illustrate a shift in mood or animate the introduction of new images in a poem. \n\nThis lesson can be completed as a 1-hour standalone lesson. There is also an option to use this lesson as the first lesson of the 5-lesson module called [Coding with Poetry](http://code.org/poetry). By the end of the Coding with Poetry module, students will write their own poems and create a poem generator app to share with friends. \n\nThe Coding with Poetry is part of Code.org’s CS Connections curriculum, which is meant to integrate CS into other subject areas like math, ELA, and science with alignment to CCSS, NGSS, and CSTA standards. \n",
        "preparation": "- Review and complete the online tutorial yourself: [Poem Art](http://studio.code.org/s/poem-art).\n \n- Be sure to try the activities first before asking your students to complete them. \n- Check your technology and decide if you need to troubleshoot anything in advance.\n- Some levels require sound to play. Hand out headphones ahead of time. \n\n- [Optional] 2 sticky notes per student for the Assessment.\n- [Optional] Pair Programming - Decide if you want students to engage in pair programming. Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxToW3ixrwo) and visit this [Support](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/115002122788-How-does-pair-programming-on-Code-org-work-) page for more information about pair programming.\n",

This lesson is designed to give students an opportunity to tinker with their code and find the visual effects that they like best. \n\nWhile circling the room, encourage students to:\n- **Take Your Time:** Most of the levels require students to find the perfect effects to match their interpretation of the mood of the poem. Staying on a level and tinkering with their code is highly encouraged. \n- **Find a poem you like:** The poem that displays for a student at a new level is just a suggestion. There is a poem dropdown menu with pre-loaded poems at the top of the playspace. Ask students to read through a few and find one that speaks to them. They can then start animating the poem they chose with code. \n\n- **Show off a completed level:** Any level bubble that is fully green means the student successfully completed all the requirements for that level. Ask a student to click on a green bubble to show off what they created. \n\nFor the times when a student feels stuck: \n- **Read the Instructions:** The instructions are bulleted points on how to complete the level. If a student feels stuck, ask them to read the instructions out loud to you and ask them to repeat back what the instructions say in their own words. \n  - <img src=\"https://images.code.org/5b99c663ad6632fe64c9da69d6805c2b-text-to-speech.PNG\" style=\"height: 25px;\"> Students can also click on this text-to-speech icon to hear the instructions read aloud.\n- <img src=\"https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/hint.png\" style=\"height: 35px;\"> **Look for hints**: Most levels include at least one hint with more explicit details about how to pass the level. \n- **Celebrate bugs:** Getting a bug in your code is a natural part of the coding process. If the program isn’t doing what they expected, ask the student to first tell you what they want to happen, click run to observe what is actually happening, then find the place in their code that caused the discrepancy. Remember to celebrate finding bugs and fixing bugs. Getting a bug means students are doing a great job building a more complex program. \n\n",

You can ask the student whether the sound and effects the programmer chose matched the mood of the poem. Ask students to elaborate on their answer. \n\n**Level 3:** This level introduces sound, students can use headphones if they have them. \n\n**Level 4:** Ask students to read the poem and find the line where the poem’s mood shifts or if there is a new image that the poet introduces. Use the event block to add corresponding effects to the identified lines of the poem. \n\n**Level 5:** In this exemplar, students should read the poem on their own first, then press Run. Ask the student whether the images matched the words of the poem. Ask them to elaborate on their answer. \n\n**Level 6, 7, 8:** See “Celebrate bugs” under the General Support section. Encourage students to build programs with more than one transition with their event blocks. \n\n**Level 9:** Encourage students to read through all the poems in the dropdown menu to find one they like.
