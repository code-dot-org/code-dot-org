Check your technology and decide if you need to troubleshoot anything in advance of your Hour of Code.\n- Review the supplementary lesson plan, [\"Dance Party: Unplugged\"](https://studio.code.org/s/dance-unplugged/lessons/1) to determine whether or not you'd like to lead this lesson in advance of your Hour of Code.\n\n### One Day Before Your Hour of Code\n\n- Each student who completes the activity should receive a certificate.

        "description": "**General Support:** As a teacher your role is primarily to support students as they make their way through the tutorial. Here are a few tips that should help students regardless of the level they're working on\n\n* **Collaborate with Neighbors:** Encourage students to check in with a neighbor when they're getting stuck. Since this tutorial includes videos and students may be wearing headphones it can get easy to \"go into a bubble\". Help break those barriers by actively pairing students if they seem like they need help. Depending on the age and ability of your students, you might consider formally breaking your class into pairs to complete the tutorial using [pair programming](https://youtu.be/vgkahOzFH2Q).  \n* **Read the Instructions:** The instructions usually provide helpful tips on how to complete the level. Before completing a level for a student ensure they've actually looked closely at the target image and read all the text there.\n* ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/hint.png)**Stuck? Look for hints:** Each level includes a hint with further details about how to pass the level. If students are trying to pass puzzles as quickly as possible, they might find they just need to wait a certain amount of time for all of the code to play out before moving on. Many levels contain a second hint with suggestions of ways to get even more creative by extending the task.\n* **Move On and Come Back:** Sometimes students will benefit more from coming back to a tricky level. All levels are independent of one another, though they do rely to some degree on previously introduced concepts.\n* **Take your time and experiment.** Even though the first couple levels tell students exactly what they need to do to pass, they should also feel free to try out their own ideas.",

You should have a `bears do once` block and a `cats do once` block in your workspace. Both should be connected to a green `when pressed` event block.\n* Make sure to press the arrow buttons after pressing Run or the dancers won’t move.",
