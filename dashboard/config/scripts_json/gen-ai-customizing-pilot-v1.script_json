Make sure students know where the instructions panel is, can send messages, know how to clear the chat, and know how to copy the chat. Building this fluency early will make later lessons easier.\n\n**Teaching Tip: Not Every Flagged Message is Inappropriate** - When a student's on-task message is flagged, it doesn't necessarily indicate inappropriate behavior; it may simply be due to a specific word triggering our filters. We encourage trying alternative words or questions. Context is crucial, as legitimate discussions can sometimes be flagged. For instance, messages mentioning \"Hitler\" are automatically flagged, which has helped us monitor student programs in the past but in this unit it affects almost any discussion on World War II, even legitimate ones. Therefore, a flagged message should be carefully reviewed to discern if it's genuinely inappropriate or just caught by our system's parameters."

After students lock in their predictions, the teacher leads a discussion asking for students to share their observations and hypotheses. There are no right-or-wrong answers - they’re just predictions. The teacher should avoid validating any predictions - instead, as the lesson progresses, students will get the chance to investigate their hypotheses and see how well their predictions matched with reality. This means the most important part of these discussions are students feeling comfortable sharing their intuitions and forming opinion, and less about “right or wrong” answers.

Students may think this is a simple prompt around writing social media - if so, push them to consider:\n\t\t<br />- Social media follows a specific format, including hashtags and tagging, which may be hard to describe in a prompt\n\t\t<br />- A key part of marketing is considering the audience - who are the people Hannah needs to reach?\n\t\t<br />- Hannah needs a tone that represents her voice, but also allows her to advertise (and get paid) by her sponsor, which is a difficult needle to thread.\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t<br />Emphasizing all of these intersecting points is a great tie-in to today’s lesson.\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td style=\"width: 25%\"><img src=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1keAW0kOKmbkg9a9Q6LrXhjPAW40T_GZEMAj2BSYcEQM/export/png?id=1keAW0kOKmbkg9a9Q6LrXhjPAW40T_GZEMAj2BSYcEQM&pageid=g2b5b268c506_0_197\"></td>\n    <td style=\"width: 75%\">\n      <i class=\"fa fa-microphone\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> <strong>Say:</strong> Designing system prompts to meet specific needs can be difficult, with so many intersecting requirements.

Very rarely should students be working through levels completely self-paced.\n\n**Teacher Exemplars:** Verified teachers can access exemplar responses and \"what success looks like\" tips for each level in the Links section of the lesson plan. If the resource doesn't appear for you, you may need to become a verified teacher - [learn more about this process here](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/115001550131-How-to-Become-a-Verified-Teacher).\n\n**Teaching with Student Responses:** Certain level types are designed to be leveraged with our [Student Summary feature](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/14544890300301-Can-I-see-a-summary-of-all-my-students-responses-for-question-based-levels), specifically: _Predict & Discuss_ and _Mid-Lesson Check-In_ levels.

After students lock in their predictions, the teacher leads a discussion asking for students to share their observations and hypotheses. There are no right-or-wrong answers - they’re just predictions. The teacher should avoid validating any predictions - instead, as the lesson progresses, students will get the chance to investigate their hypotheses and see how well their predictions matched with reality. This means the most important part of these discussions are students feeling comfortable sharing their intuitions and forming opinion, and less about “right or wrong” answers.

This can help us understand how the sentence “The food in Tucson is awesome - some great restaurants in Tucson are Poco and Moms, Kingfisher, and Franks.” impacts our model.\n- In the initial training data, a word like “Franks” was probably “close” to an entirely different set of words. For example: it could be “close” to “hot dog” or “person” or “blunt” because of the phrase “Let me be frank with you…”\n- This sentence creates a new association between “Franks” and the phrase “great restaurant”, along with other great restaurants like Kingfisher and Poco and Moms.\n- This helps update the embedding for “Franks” so it is now “closer” to other great restaurants, and more likely to be listed in a chatbot response."

Consider regrouping the class only if there seems to be a larger misconception that needs clarifying. Otherwise, it may be better to spend class working with students who need additional support based on yesterday’s lesson and the check-in level. Verified teachers can review exemplars and strategies for each level as a resource in the lesson plan.\n\n**Teaching Tip: Less Writing, More Copying**\nThis lesson implicitly encourages students to spend their time searching for sources and copying directly from them, rather than trying to write retrieval information themselves (which is mostly what they did yesterday). This correlates to how retrieval works in a more realistic sense with actual language models: instead of looking at individual words or statements, modern large-language models ingest entire documents or manuals or websites in order to augment their knowledgebase. For that reason, try to encourage students to put their energy into finding quality sources (like websites or books) to copy from, since this is the more realistic behavior of language models outside of this lab."

This means student answers should be used for class discussions, specifically to expand how students think about when to apply retrieval vs system prompting in certain situations. The discussion aspect of these levels is vital to the lesson since it lets students heart other strategies and opinions to help inform their own thinking on when to use retrieval and when to use system prompt.

This means, for the pilot, there really isn’t anything “new” to explore. By the time we launch, we hope to have 5 or 6 different choices so students can spend some time in this level comparing the different models and seeing how the responses differ.

This is very loosely inspired by real-world events where school districts relied on chatbots like ChatGPT to make decisions about books to comply with state laws. In an effort to comply with these new laws, several school districts hastily resorted to using AI to make recommendations on certain books to remove from circulation. This is an example of how an intended user - libraries and schools - were using chatbots for a surprising and unintended use case with a wide variety of affected uses (also both intended and unintended).

Students who may have been confident and engaged in earlier lessons may find themselves deflated by the task of writing about their chatbots and describing their decisions. It can be helpful to acknowledge this change in dynamic, but encourage students to lean into it rather than away from it. Taking time to document and describe our chatbots and other digital artifacts is a core part of any new technology, and might take a different set of skills but is just as important. Be sure to provide writing supports to students who may need it, such as having students explain it to you first before writing it down."

In the original lesson, there are 9 different scenarios that students can choose from to participate in, but in this lesson there is only one scenario (the medical one).\n\nThe original lesson is also designed to be an hour long. For this lesson, the warm-up has been removed to shorten the lesson.\n\nIf you would like to extend and enrich this lesson, consider exploring the other scenarios in the original lesson."

Here's the big picture behind this activity:\n- Students are [participating in a **collaborative game**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rqtfMZyn-UekUoVFgYCHyVqOa7StNY9-wl-FlLOaZqk/edit#heading=h.59k2gm16lgj2), where each person takes on a specific role or persona and they all have to work together to \"win\" against the scenario set out by the game. This is similar in spirit to board games like [Pandemic](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30549/pandemic) or [Forbidden Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbidden_Island_(game))\n- Students will be in groups of 4, where all four people have taken on a persona [related to a specific scenario](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9P0FYWMBDQguWedAGi541P-HYbRS1gbcjFbFxdpRSk/edit). Their goal will be to work together to come up with guidelines for Generative AI that try to satisfy the needs and goals of everyone in the group. \n  - For example: an actor, a producer, an audience member, and a costume designer must work together to come up with guidelines for use of Generative AI in movie productions.\n- Each student has a particular persona they can embody on a [Character Card](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e0C1Tp1JhpnJNFjzlxI-bJpisZmZZe6uyglW0JgNm7s/edit). These cards include some baseline information about how this person might feel about generative AI, along with some news articles that students read and react to _as this character_.\n\n\nEven though the ultimate goal is to be in a group as a character solving a problem, the lesson plan introduces these steps in stages rather than explaining the full game all-at-once. First students are introduced to their character and read their news articles. Once they understand their character, then they form their groups and are given their scenario. And once they understand their scenario, they can begin the collaborative game of coming up with guidelines for generative AI."
