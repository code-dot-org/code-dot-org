During online activities, the role of the teacher is primarily one of encouragement and support. Online lessons are meant to be student-centered, so teachers should avoid stepping in when students get stuck. Some ideas on how to do this are: \r\n\r\n - Utilize pair programming whenever possible during the activity.\r\n - Encourage students with questions/challenges to start by asking their partner.\r\n - Unanswered questions can be escalated to a nearby group, who might already know the solution.\r\n - Remind students to use the debugging process before you approach.\r\n - Have students describe the problem that they’re seeing. What is it supposed to do? What does it do? What does that tell you?\r\n - Remind frustrated students that frustration is a step on the path to learning, and that persistence will pay off.\r\n - If a student is still stuck after all of this, ask leading questions to get the student to spot an error on their own.",

During online activities, the role of the teacher is primarily one of encouragement and support. Online lessons are meant to be student-centered, so teachers should avoid stepping in when students get stuck. Some ideas on how to do this are: \r\n\r\n - Utilize **Pair Programming - Student Video** whenever possible\r\n - Encourage students with questions/challenges to start by asking their partner\r\n - Unanswered questions can be escalated to a nearby group, who might already know the solution\r\n - Remind students to use the debugging process before you approach\r\n - Have students describe the problem that they’re seeing. What is it supposed to do? What does it do? What does that tell you?\r\n - Remind frustrated students that frustration is a step on the path to learning, and that persistence will pay off\r\n - If a student is still stuck after all of this, ask leading questions to get the student to spot an error on their own"

During online activities, the role of the teacher is primarily one of encouragement and support. Online lessons are meant to be student-centered, so teachers should avoid stepping in when students get stuck. Some ideas on how to do this are: \r\n\r\n - Utilize [r pair-programming-vid] whenever possible\r\n - Encourage students with questions/challenges to start by asking their partner\r\n - Unanswered questions can be escalated to a nearby group, who might already know the solution\r\n - Remind students to use the debugging process before you approach\r\n - Have students describe the problem that they’re seeing. What is it supposed to do? What does it do? What does that tell you?\r\n - Remind frustrated students that frustration is a step on the path to learning, and that persistence will pay off.\r\n - If a student is still stuck after all of this, ask leading questions to get the student to spot an error on their own."

I would need to program the character to only move when I put my finger on the screen of my phone.\r\n\t\t- Putting my finger on the screen would then become an \"event\" that tells my character to move.\r\n\r\nIn earlier lessons, we created algorithms that allowed us to control a friend or Flurb for several steps at a time. It was fun and useful, but what happens when you don’t know everything that you want your friend to do in advance? This is where events come in!\r\n\r\n\r\n**Directions:**\r\n\r\n- Project **The Big Event (Courses A, B) - Controller Image** onto your classroom screen.\r\n\r\n![](csf/c1_TheBigEvent1.png)\r\n\r\n- Decide with your class what each button does. We suggest:\r\n\t- Pink Button -> Say “Wooooo!”\r\n\t- Teal Button -> “Yeah!”\r\n\t- Purple Dial -> “Boom!”\r\n- Practice tapping the buttons on the overhead and having your class react.\r\n- Add some button sequences into the mix and have the students try to keep up with their sounds.\r\n- Let your class know that every time you push a button, it is an “event” that lets them know what they are expected to do next.\r\n- Get the class started on a planned task before interrupting them again with the buttons. We suggest:\r\n\t- Counting to 10\r\n\t- Singing “Old MacDonald”\r\n- Once their plan is underway, interject button presses sporadically.\r\n- Continue the blend until they understand the difference between actions that are guided by a plan and those that are event driven.",
