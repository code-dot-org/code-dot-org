Before giving students the answer, ensure they've carefully looked at the instructions, hints, videos, and any starter code carefully.\n- **Stuck? Look for hints**: Each level includes a hint with advice for how to pass a level, including which blocks of code to try out.\n- **Take your time and experiment**. The instructions tell students generally what to do, but they should also feel free to try out their own ideas.\n"

Before giving students the answer, ensure they've carefully looked at the instructions, hints, videos, and any starter code carefully.\n- **Stuck? Look for hints**: Each level includes a hint with advice for how to pass a level, including which blocks of code to try out.\n- **Take your time and experiment**. The instructions tell students generally what to do, but they should also feel free to try out their own ideas.\n"
