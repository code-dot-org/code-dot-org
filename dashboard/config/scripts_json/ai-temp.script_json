Bot to recognize, and record this information on their Activity Guide. Students should progress through the level on their own, recording information on their activity guide. On the final screen, have students press the information icon and record the features that A.I. Bot learned were most important.\n\n**Circulate:** Check that students are filling in their activity guide as they complete the stages. Ask students what features they’re looking at to determine if a fish meets their criteria. Students will probably say they primarily use eyes and mouth to help determine expression, but when they click the Information icon on the final screen, A.I. Bot may be using additional features such as color and body to make its decision. Prompt students to think about how they feel about this and compare it to their personal experience - For example, if someone thought they were “silly” or “angry” primarily based on their clothing.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** Show the slide of A.I. Bot learning how to identify fish as “Angry”. Have students discuss the prompt on the screen: _Looking at this screen, why do you think color appeared as the second most important feature?_\n\n **Discussion Goal:** Students should notice that even though the eyes and mouth tend to appear “angry” on every fish, there also appears to be a lot of purple fish on the screen. As a result, A.I. Bot may start to think that the color “purple” is another way to tell if a fish is angry or not.\n"
