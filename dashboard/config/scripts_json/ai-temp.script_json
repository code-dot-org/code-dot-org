Students should explore their own ideas and feelings about whether this kind of labeling is appropriate based on the color of the fish. In particular, A.I. Bot has learned “purple fish are angry fish”, which students may have strong reactions to. They may describe similar situations outside of the classroom, such as moments where they’ve been judged by their appearance, gender, or race, to help explain their opinions. This question is designed to start a conversation and connect students’ experiences to the potential pitfalls of machine learning, and it’s okay if the discussion doesn’t come to a firm conclusion. You can let students know that they will continue to learn about and discuss these issues in the rest of the unit. Use the remarks below to help wrap up the discussion."

You play by guessing a word that is \"closest\" to a target word in a list.\n- [Semantle](https://semantle.com/) is a Wordle-ish variant that allows players to guess a secret word by finding words that are slowly getting closer in distance. \n- [Mind Meld](https://www.hooplaimpro.com/mind-meld) is an improv game that has two people say two random words at the same time, then try to find the word that is most common or \"between\" these two other words. They repeat this process - saying both words at the same time - with the goal of both people saying the same word at the same time. This means they've successfully \"closed the distance\" from their starting words by successively finding words they had in common.\n\nAll of these are optional and not part of the lesson plan, but can be interesting or fun \"brain breaks\" during other lessons or downtime in class.\n\n**Digging Deeper:** If you would like more information about the models behind Large Language Models, the YouTube channel [AI Coffee Break with Letitia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH-wmtxHunk&list=PLpZBeKTZRGPNdymdEsSSSod5YQ3Vu0sKY&index=2) has a lot of great explanatory videos on this topic.
