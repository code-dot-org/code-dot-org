Students begin by looking at a variety of shoes and attempting to match each shoe with a potential user. Students also provide feedback on these designs, using an “I Like…” / “I Wish…” / “I Wonder…” structure that will be repeated throughout the unit.

Emphasize that users have a set list of tasks to complete, and both people should give reactions on ways to improve the experience. Some of these tasks may not even be possible, which means we can make suggestions for how to improve the app and complete the task.\n\n**Model:** This activity has pairs of students testing the paper prototype, with one acting as the _User_ and one as the _Computer_. The basic process is as follows, and should be modeled for students before working independently in their pairs:\n\n1. The _Computer_ places the home screen (the one titled \"Txt Ur Grndkds\") in front of the _User_.\n2. The _User_ selects a task from the table on their activity guide.\n3. The _User_ attempts to complete the tasking by \"clicking\" on the paper prototype screen in front of them.\n4. Every time the _User_ clicks on the screen, the _Computer_ consults the Navigation Diagram on their activity guide.\n\t* If the Navigation Diagram shows a line connected to the element that was clicked, find the screen at the other end of the line and place it in front of the user.\n\t* If the Navigation Diagram doesn't show a line connected to the element that was clicked, do nothing.\n5. When the _User_ completes a task (or decides it is impossible in the current prototype), they fill out the \"What I Tried\" and \"My Reaction\" columns and the computer resets the app back to the home screen.\n\n**Circulate**: Monitor students as they work in pairs to complete this task. Ensure computers are using the guided arrows to navigate the screens, and ensure users are completing each row of tasks in the table. Have students swap halfway through the task, trading who is the user and who is the computer."

Remind them of some of the norms for this activity:\n\n* One user per sticky note\n* No bad answers\n* Build on others’ suggestions with “Yes, and…”\n* Every idea is appreciated, no matter how wild!\n\n**Team Name:** To warm-up and practice brainstorming, give teams a few minutes to come up with a team name and record it on the activity guide. Encourage students to complete this in three steps:\n\n* Write down any team name ideas on a post-it and place it in the center of your group\n* As a team, categorize and group post-its\n* As a team, discuss the options you like the most and decide on a team name.\n\n**Circulate:** Monitor students as they complete this process, making sure students are following the brainstorming process. They will repeat this process many times throughout the unit, and developing a team name is a low-stakes way to practice the process itself.\n   \n**Topic:** Give teams roughly five minutes to choose a general topic for their app. It's important to remind them that they aren't trying to come up with what the app will do or any specifics at this point, but just agreeing on a general topic that it should address. They should use the same brainstorming process as above - ideas on stickies, grouping & categorizing ideas, then discussing and coming to a decision.\n\n**Circulate:** Monitor students as they complete this process, focusing on whether or not students are sticking to communication, participation, and decision-making norms they decided earlier in the lesson. As you interact with groups, it may be helpful to model inclusive sentence starters that teams can use when brainstorming.\n\n**User Groups:** Give students some time to generate ideas for different users who might use their app. They will have 5 minutes to generate their post-its and group them, but they don’t need to make a decision about specific users yet. Once teams have groups of possible users for their topic, they should discuss one or two potential categories they would like to focus on. They will have time during the next two lessons to further research and refine their target user group, but they want to have a clear starting point to guide that research.\n\n**Circulate:** Monitor groups as they complete this process, focusing on their choice of user groups. Check that the groups are specific enough that students will be able to identify a set of needs common to the group's members.  For example, \"students\" is probably too broad, since it could include a wide variety of ages and goals. For these examples, encourage students to get more specific, such as narrowing in on students by age or location or mode of transportation.\n\n**Share:** Ask each team to briefly share their name, topic, and a description of one of their target user groups.",

Specifically, highlight the following observations:\n\n- The user is the person who is testing the app in the form of the paper prototype. They should pretend to execute the “app” by pressing on the prototype with their fingers in the way that makes the most sense.\n- The user speaks through what they are thinking-out-loud. They can also offer helpful suggestions in our critiquing form with sentences starting with “I like…”, “I wish…”, and “I wonder… “\n- The computer reacts to what the user does. If the user tries something that isn’t a part of the app navigation diagram, then the computer doesn’t react.\n- The narrator is the person who is running the test. This person will introduce the team members, the app, and its purpose.\n- The observers are the other students in the team. They will watch the interaction and write down in their notes what they see the user do in response to the computer. They don’t make any comments themselves - they just take notes.\n\n**Assign Roles:** Read through the (2) Assign Roles for Testing section of the activity guide. Have students discuss in their teams which roles they will take on in the first round of testing. There should be only one narrator and only one computer, and all other team members can be observers. \n\n**Create Test Cases:** Read through the (3) Create Test Cases section of the activity guide. Students will work in the User Test Cases Activity Guide for this section, filling in the App Introduction section and completing the left-column of the table. They should not fill in the rest of the table - the user will do this instead.\n\n**Circulate:** Monitor students as they fill in the User Test Cases Activity Guide. Make sure they are only filling in the left-most column with the tasks they want their user to test - the rest of the chart should be blank."

This is particularly troublesome when students leave the default screen ID \"screen1\"\r\n* _Conflicting element IDs:_ If students have properly namespaced all of their elements this shouldn't be an issue, but any elements that have the default ID or share an ID with an existing element will prevent a screen from importing\r\n\r\n**Working Independently:** Once teams move to the programming phase of this project, it becomes much more difficult for students to collaborate on the same app. The design phase is the primary opportunity for all students to collaborate on the app - after this teams will still be working together, but each student will be working on their own copy of the app. Encourage students to use this as an opportunity to be creative and add personal style decisions to their personal version of the team app.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

You can have teams decide which of these three they would like to consider, or you can choose one for the entire class:\n\n* **Stay Together on One App:** Each team chooses one of their team’s apps to focus on and add updates to - for example, the app they used for testing. During class, the entire team works together to implement one feature at a time using Pair Programming - one team member is the driver while the rest of the team helps navigate\n\t* **Pros:** Everyone is working on the same app, and there is one completed app at the end\n\t* **Cons:** Won’t be able to implement as many features since everyone is working together, and can be less engaging for navigators when there are large teams.\n* **Split Off For Some Updates, Then Recombine to One App:** Half of the team works together on one app to implement any bug fixes or feature updates on existing screens, and the other half of the team works on new features and new code that requires whole new screens. Before class ends, both teams re-share their project share URL so they can re-import the screens into their projects. They will also have to find a way to share code with each other - this usually involves converting to text mode and sharing with another student, such as via a shared Google Doc.\n\t* **Pros:** Easier to implement more features and, after the sharing, there is one completed app at the end\n\t* **Cons:** Re-importing screens and sharing code can get messy and takes time away from implementing new features\n* **Everyone Works on Separate Apps:** Each team member works on their own version of the app, implementing their bug fixes and new features just in their app.\n\t* **Pros:** Easiest way to implement features and most of the class time is spent updating the app\n\t* **Cons:** There is no “unified” app with all of the features in one place, and there's less opportunity for collaboration and teamwork"

Teams could pretend they are on one of these shows and are “pitching” their app. Their goal would be to get the audience to invest in their app and help fund future development.\r\n"
