        "description": "Music Filtering\nThis tutorial features songs from popular artists. To get a preview of the song list in this tutorial, check out this Spotify Playlist (all ages) . We are using radio-safe versions of all songs and for students under 13.\nGeneral Support\nGeneral Support: As a teacher your role is primarily to support students as they make their way through the tutorial. Here are a few tips that should help students regardless of the level they're working on\nCollaborate with Neighbors: Encourage students to check in with a neighbor when they're getting stuck. Since this tutorial includes videos and students may be wearing headphones it can get easy to \"go into a bubble\". Help break those barriers by actively pairing students if they seem like they need help. Depending on the age and ability of your students, you might consider formally breaking your class into pairs to complete the tutorial using pair programming.\nRead the Instructions: The instructions usually provide helpful tips on how to complete the level. Before completing a level for a student ensure they've actually looked closely at the target image and read all the text there.\nStuck? Look for hints: Each level includes a hint with further details about how to pass the level. If students are trying to pass puzzles as quickly as possible, they might find they just need to wait a certain amount of time for all of the code to play out before moving on. Many levels contain a second hint with suggestions of ways to get even more creative by extending the task.\nMove On and Come Back: Sometimes students will benefit more from coming back to a tricky level. All levels are independent of one another, though they do rely to some degree on previously introduced concepts.\nTake your time and experiment. Even though the first couple levels tell students exactly what they need to do to pass, they should also feel free to try out their own ideas."
