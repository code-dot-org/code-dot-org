This lesson is designed to give students an opportunity to tinker with their code and find the visual effects that they like best. \n\nWhile circling the room, encourage students to:\n- **Take Your Time:** Most of the levels require students to find the perfect effects to match their interpretation of the mood of the poem. Staying on a level and tinkering with their code is highly encouraged. \n- **Find a poem you like:** The poem that displays for a student at a new level is just a suggestion. There is a poem dropdown menu with pre-loaded poems at the top of the playspace. Ask students to read through a few and find one that speaks to them. They can then start animating the poem they chose with code. \n\n- **Show off a completed level:** Any level bubble that is fully green means the student successfully completed all the requirements for that level. Ask a student to click on a green bubble to show off what they created. \n\nFor the times when a student feels stuck: \n- **Read the Instructions:** The instructions are bulleted points on how to complete the level. If a student feels stuck, ask them to read the instructions out loud to you and ask them to repeat back what the instructions say in their own words. \n  - <img src=\"https://images.code.org/5b99c663ad6632fe64c9da69d6805c2b-text-to-speech.PNG\" style=\"height: 25px;\"> Students can also click on this text-to-speech icon to hear the instructions read aloud.\n- <img src=\"https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/hint.png\" style=\"height: 35px;\"> **Look for hints**: Most levels include at least one hint with more explicit details about how to pass the level. \n- **Celebrate bugs:** Getting a bug in your code is a natural part of the coding process. If the program isn’t doing what they expected, ask the student to first tell you what they want to happen, click run to observe what is actually happening, then find the place in their code that caused the discrepancy. Remember to celebrate finding bugs and fixing bugs. Getting a bug means students are doing a great job building a more complex program. \n",

Variables can be tricky and they are used frequently in computer science and in the rest of this module. Additional whole class or individual questions might include: \n\n- How is a variable like a box? Answer: Variables can store information like a name or a number. \n- How is a variable like something else we have in class? Answer: Perhaps students have a desk or cubby with their name on it. The desk or cubby is like a “variable” that holds their information or their papers or their lunch. \n- What is a variable label? Answer: It is the name the coder gives the variable. \n- Why do we need a variable label? Answer: To keep track of the variable in case we want to use it again later. \n- In the example program in Level 1, what is being stored in the variable labeled “word1”? Answer: What the user types into the text field under the prompt. \n- Can a variable name have a space in it? No, variable labels can only be one word.\n"

Ask a student who is done with their program to user test their program with a student who is feeling stuck. Ask them to work together to debug any code. \n\n3.  Pair Program: Ask elbow partners who might benefit from talking through their code out loud to work together by methodically working on one person’s program and then the other person’s program. One student should be the driver, while the other is the navigator. [See Preparation Section at the top of this lesson plan for more details].
