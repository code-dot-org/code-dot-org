Since we trained our model only on fruits and vegetables, it doesn’t work very well on other types of foods. If we wanted to improve our model, we’d probably need a lot more data and a lot more features - more than just how sweet and easy-to-eat food is. This gets a lot harder for us as humans to understand, and we couldn’t use our graph paper anymore. Luckily, computers can help us with this!
