In small groups, students conduct research using articles and videos that expose ethical pitfalls in an Artificial Intelligence (AI) area of their choice. Afterward, each group develops at least one solution-oriented principle that addresses their chosen area. These principles are then assembled into a class-wide “Our AI Code of Ethics” resource (e.g. a slide presentation, document, or webpage) for AI creators and legislators everywhere.",
