Lessons 11, 12, and 13 collectively include instructions for the three-day project.\n\nIf there is not enough time for the three-day project, a one-day option is available that achieves the targeted learning objectives and goals. If using this option, refer to the [**Neighborhood Block Party Project 1 Day Lesson Plan**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xQ1NB9PSyIhNymwCulbU3YLRA8jBKbMvy2qsXTBaJCM/edit?usp=sharing), which includes a one-day version of the [**Neighborhood Block Party Project Planning Guide**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tJRsllS_PR2bn0ZcHwrwo3Tgsxvqc7r9XAuP4HM6R6E/edit?usp=sharing).
