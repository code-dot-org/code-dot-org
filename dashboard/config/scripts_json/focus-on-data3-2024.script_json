        "description": "**General Support:** As a teacher your role is primarily to support students as they make their way through the tutorial. Here are a few tips that should help students regardless of the level they're working on\n\n* **Checking Correctness:** This tutorial will not tell students whether they completed the level correctly. Encourage students to use the target images and directions provided in every level to know if they are on the right track. If students want to move on past a particularly tricky level they can simply click \"Finish\" and continue on.\n* **Collaborate with Neighbors:** Encourage students to check in with a neighbor when they're getting stuck. Since this tutorial includes videos and students may be wearing headphones it can get easy to \"go into a bubble\". Help break those barriers by actively pairing students if they seem like they need help.\n* **Read the Instructions:** The instructions usually provide helpful tips on how to complete the level. Before completing a level for a student ensure they've actually looked closely at the target image and read all the text there.\n* **Stuck? Click here:** Each level includes a GIF showing exactly how to complete the level. If students want help they can and should use these GIFs. If they only want to use them as a hint, just have them close the GIF once they've seen the first part.\n* **Move On and Come Back:** Sometimes students will benefit more from coming back to a tricky level. Except for the \"Design Mode\" sequence, all levels are independent of one another, though they do rely to some degree on previously introduced concepts.",

When in doubt, students should first change the first two dropdowns, then use the last one as a model for what values work there. The most common error is failing to use double quotes around a color name.\n* **Hover to Read IDs:** By hovering over an element in your app you can read its ID.

This is never the intended behavior for this tutorial. Even though this is mentioned in the videos, a quick reminder might help get kids unstuck.\n* **Check Your IDs:** You need to change the `\"id\"` property in `onEvent()` so that it detects events with the correct element.\n* **You Can Use Multiple Blocks in an `onEvent()`:** If you want multiple things to happen when you click the same button, just add more blocks to the same `onEvent()`. You should never have a program that has two `onEvent()` blocks for the combination of element (e.g. \"button1\") and event type (e.g. \"click\").",

Have the class consider whether gender feels like a necessary question, or if other questions will also lead to accurate recommendations. In this way, asking about gender is similar to the previous two questions about which sandwich you like or the type of day you're having: the other questions are probably better predictors of what type of book you may read.",

They can also use the animated example on the level as a guide for how to complete this task.\n- **Level 6:** Students add a button from the home screen to the predict screen, and add an event to connect the two screens together.

Students can access a resource in the Help and Tips section of Code Studio that explains how to select a label in AI Lab\n\n**Revisiting Past Screens:** Let students know it’s okay to go back and revisit past screens to improve their model or make different decisions - this is an important part of the process and something students should practice in this level. Students may find themselves starting to move fluently between the testing, feature, and label screens as they refine and improve their machine learning model.\n\n**Level 2 - Where Are The Tables?** In level 2, students predict the type of animal that they are looking at (like mammal, reptile, etc). This column has too many possible values, and so many data visualization tables won't appear. This is intentional, since it challenges students to use feature iteration and the Previous Results screens intentionally to find features that work. They need to trust that, if there are patterns in the data, AI Bot will find them and produce an accurate model even when there's too much data to visualize. This also prepares students for more realistic examples where there are typically more than 4 or 5 values for a feature.\n\n**Accuracy and Data Representation**: Students may be able to discover some curious combinations that give 100% accuracy. This may be because the particular features they chose are not well represented in the dataset - for example, only 8 out of the 100 animals are considered Venomous. This could lead to inflated accuracy, especially if those animals are not well represented in the testing set. If you notice students training models like this, ask them to thoroughly test their models and compare the results to their real-world experiences to make sure the model matches reality. Remind them that just because a model has high accuracy on its testing data doesn't mean it will have high accuracy in the real world."

This is a step that will be important when students create their own custom apps in later projects.\n- **Level 4 and 5:** Students are only updating the code of their app to use the new design elements for the Number of Cars and Weather features. They can use the hints within the level instructions for clues on what to do in each step.\n- **Level 6:** Students update both the design and the code of their app to collect data for the Temperature feature. Help students keep track of the new text input element they add to the temperature screen, and make sure the ID of the element matches the one they use in the [`getText`(#fff176)](/docs/applab/getText/) block of their code.\n- **Level 7:** Students update both the design and the code of their app to collect data for the Time of Day feature. Adding the design element and updating the code is similar to the last level, but this step has the added requirement of using the Model Card to check the possible values are for this categorical feature. Students may make spelling or capitalization errors that can effect their code - encourage students to be very careful to match their dropdown options exactly with the model card.\n- **Level 8:** Students have a chance to run their app and verify that it works. Students will only need to make changes to the code on this level if their program doesn't work. Otherwise, if the app works correctly, students can continue to the next level."

After adding these new design mode elements, students will need to update their code to use the new elements as well. Students can refer to [Lesson 13](../13), especially level 1, as an example of how to update their code to fix this problem.\n\n**Strategy #2: Reposition Elements.** Even though the elements are off the screen, you can use Design Mode to manually select them and re-position them so they are on the screen. This involves changing the y-position property to 0 so it is on the screen, and then re-arranging the element like you would normally."

Students might suggest that Zoey collects more data before trying to train her model again.\n- **Isaac’s Data:** Isaac’s models will always be low because none of his features have a strong relationship to his label - students should notice that none of the Cross Tab charts have strong hot spots with any question. If students look at the questions themselves, they may notice that they don’t seem to have a strong relationship to the label Isaac is trying to predict. Students may recommend Isaac choose different questions and collecting his data again.\n- **Kim’s Data:** Kim’s models can be very accurate, but when students test the model they may find the questions and answer choices very specific and not inclusive - for example, the “favorite lunch food” question only contains meat options. Students may suggest that, even though the model is accurate, Kim may want to choose different questions that are more broad and inclusive rather than so specific.\n- **Nico’s Data:** Nico’s models can be very accurate, but when students test the model they may find that the majority of the recommendation is for the “Band Club” no matter what they pick. Students may need some prompting to notice this, but the data selection screen shows that Nico collected data primarily from people in a band, which biased his model towards recommending the Band club. Students may recommend Nico can avoid this next time by making sure he has a wide variety of people complete his survey."

There are a variety of factors that could make this difficult, especially if students didn't have a chance to collect enough data or the data doesn't lead to accurate models. Here are some strategies to help students move past these issues:\n\n- **Documenting in the Model Card**: Even if the data doesn't appear to create an accurate model, students can still use this data to complete the project as long as they document their decisions in the Model Card, especially in the Limitations section. Even though this means they are creating an app without an accurate model, it provides an opportunity for reflection on what could have gone differently in a future project.\n- **Use a pre-supplied dataset:** Several datasets are available in AI Lab for students to use if their survey data isn't leading to fruitful results. Students can use one of these datasets instead to complete their project. This may require adjusting the focus of their app, but students will at least be able to complete the project\n- **Exploring Advanced Datasets:** AI Lab is designed to work with machine learning datasets from several common websites, such as [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). Students can explore this website to find a dataset that fits their needs, then use the dataset in AI Lab to train their model. An account is required to download datasets - we recommend having a teacher create an account and manage downloading datasets for students.\n\nIn general, this project focuses on students' ability to plan and execute an AI app that addresses an issue they care about, from ideation to data collection to app creation. Completing this cycle is ultimately more important than having an accurate app, especially since students have previously completed the mini-project which focuses more on training an accurate model and since students can document the intended uses and limitations on a Model Card."

They should use previous model cards as examples of what to include. Students can also use post-its or notecards to complete the Label and Features section of their model cards. These cards can then be displayed around the room as a tangible representation of their work during this unit\n- [r model_card_-_digital_template/focus-on-data/2024] - Have students make a copy of the Model Card digital template that they can edit. Any _italicized_ text in [brackets] can be replaced with their own words. They can also create copies of the digital post-it notes for the Label and Features screen. These digital versions can be posted on a virtual gallery along with their apps as a way to represent their work during this unit."

After adding these new design mode elements, students will need to update their code to use the new elements as well. Students can refer to [Lesson 13](../11), especially level 1, as an example of how to update their code to fix this problem.\n\n**Strategy #2: Reposition Elements.** Even though the elements are off the screen, you can use Design Mode to manually select them and re-position them so they are on the screen. This involves changing the y-position property to 0 so it is on the screen, and then re-arranging the element like you would normally."
