Your students will be able to create working code which they can test out in the simulator before transferring them to a real micro:bit over a USB cable. They can then unplug the micro:bit from the computer, attach a battery pack, and use their projects anywhere.\n\nBy making micro:bit projects, your students can take their code off the screen and make self-contained physical devices they can hold in the palm of their hands, making abstract computing concepts tangible.",

Does anyone have a favorite dance move?*\n\t- *Have you ever watched a dance team perform to music together? How do they stay in sync?*\n\t\t- *One way to do this might be to plan out all of the moves in advance. It's almost like the dancers are programmed! Computer scientists would call this an algorithm because it's a list of steps to get something done.*\n\t\t- *Another way to keep in sync is to have a cue that tells everyone when to change to a different move. Everyone would still need to know what moves to perform and agree on what the cues mean.*\n\t- *If I want everyone in class to clap at the exact same time, I could do that by giving you a countdown from 3.* (Try it!) \n\t- *When I reached \"1\", that was the event that gave you all the signal to clap.*\n- Ask the class if they can think of any other events that could give signals.\n\t- You may need to remind them that you're not talking about an event like a birthday party or a field trip.\n\t- If they have trouble, you can remind them that an event is an action that causes something to happen.\n\t\t- Blowing a whistle\n\t\t- Waving a flag\n\t\t- Saying a magic word\n\t\t- Pressing a button\n- *Today, we're going to organize our class dance party using events.*",

To solve this puzzle, place a `set size` block anywhere in your program and use it to change the size of some of your dancers. \n* Dancers created as a group have a default size of 30. Other dancers have a default size of 100.\n\n##### Level 12\n\n* As with the previous level, make sure to only use the `set tint to (color)` block after you have made the dancers in your program. For example, placing it as the first step in the `setup` area of your program will have no effect.\n\n##### Level 13\n\n* With the right code, you should see the dancer cycle through different colors, sizes, or dance moves.\n* Make sure there is a teal `change`, a teal `randomize` block, or a purple `do forever` block connected inside the `every 2 measures` block. \n* Make sure `do forever` blocks are set to either (Next), (Previous), or (Random). Otherwise, the dancer will just perform the set move repeatedly.\n* Note that the **code students write in this level is not checked for correctness**. This means they will always pass the level, even if they do not change the program. Students should feel free to experiment with their code in ways that are interesting to them. Click the “Finish” button to move on.\n* Making new dancers inside the `every 2 measures` block will cause your program to create multiple identical dancers at the same location(s) and may lead to unintended consequences!\n",

While displaying a scenario image, read its accompanying script to the class (see below). Discussion questions are included in relevant slides.\n\n#### Designing for Accessibility Scenarios\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** Show \"Meet Wei\" slide\n\n* Wei is a talented kid who LOVES music. She plays piano and sings very well! \n* Wei is visually impaired. While she is not completely blind, it is very difficult for her to see things, even if they are near her eyes.\n* Wei has had to learn piano differently from kids who aren’t visually impaired, but that hasn’t stopped her from becoming a great musician! \n* Wei recently began creating her own music. She is very proud of it! She would like to record and share her music with her friends.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** Show \"Introducing Grammaphone!\" slide\n\n* Grammaphone is a popular new app that allows people to upload and share their own music with friends. \n\n**Discuss**: What do you think about this app? How do you think this app works?\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** Show \"Wei and Grammaphone\" slide\n\n* Wei needs to use Grammaphone to share her music. After all, it’s the most popular music-sharing app!\n* However, she’s having a difficult time using the app. Why do you think that is? \n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** Show \"Meet Roger\" slide\n\n* Roger is an energetic kid who loves video games! He especially likes playing sports games with his friends.\n* Things have been hard for Roger lately, though. A few years ago, Roger’s hand had to be “amputated” (surgically removed) due to an accident. \n* Thankfully, computer scientists, engineers, and doctors are working hard to provide Roger with a cool-looking robotic “prosthetic hand,” which will be awesome!\n* But for now, Roger wants to play sports video games with his friends! \n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** Show \"Introducing Football Frenzy!\" slide\n\n* Football Frenzy is a new mobile game that everyone loves!\n* It has cool graphics, awesome sound effects, tight controls, and amazing action!\n\n**Discuss**: What do you think about this app? How do you think this game is played?\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** Show \"Roger and Football Frenzy\" slide\n\n* All of Roger’s friends play Football Frenzy. It’s connected online so that you can play it anywhere!\n* Roger wants to play Football Frenzy with them, but he is having a difficult time. Why do you think that is?\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** Show \"Designing for Accessibility\" slide\n\n* Neither of these apps was designed with people like Wei and Roger in mind.\n* When it comes to these apps, what specific features do you think Wei and Roger wish for? \n* Let’s redesign these apps! \n\n####App Redesign Activity (25 min)\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: “Your turn!” slide\n\nThe final scenario allows students to sketch a redesign of one app from the scenarios (\"Grammaphone\" for Wei or \"Football Frenzy\" for Roger). \n\nStudents should primarily focus their efforts on making their redesigned app more accessible for either of them, along with any other accessibility features they can think of. Students can design as many screens for the app as they wish, and they do not need to make their app look anything like the original examples.\n\nIf there is time, students may redesign apps for both characters.\n\n**Distribute**: Pass out crayons/pencils/etc. to each student as they open their reflection journals. \n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: “Share Out” slide\n\n**Share**: After designing, students share their app design with a neighbor, or if there is time, some students can share with the whole class. Each student should answer how their app design addresses the need of the user in question."

(Three additional slides have been provided for this part of the activity if needed.)\n\n\n\n\nOnce the class has had some practice, you can encourage students to nest conditionals inside one another. Make sure they understand that if the card is red, YOUR team is awarded 1 point, and then _nothing else happens_, since the condition was met:\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: Show \"Let's nest conditionals” slide\n\n\n\n\tIf (CARD is RED)\n\t\tAward YOUR team 1 point\n\t\n\tElse\n\t\tIf (CARD is higher than 9)\n\t\t\tAward OTHER team 1 point\n\t\tElse\n\t\t\tAward YOUR team the same number of points on the card\n\n\n\nHere is the same program in pseudocode:\n\n\tIf (card.color == RED ){\n\t\tpoints.yours = points.yours + 1;\n\t}\n\tElse {\n\t\tif (card.value > 9){\n\t\t\tpoints.other = points.other + 1;\n\t\t}\n\t\tElse {\n\t\t\tpoints.yours = points.yours + card.value;\n\t\t}\n\t}"

        "description": "This activity introduces the concepts of If/Then using the familiar fairytale of the Three Little Pigs. The story clearly demonstrates the \"if\" and \"then\" relationship that forms the core of conditional statements. By seeing the pigs make choices (building with different materials) and the resulting consequences (strong house vs. weak house), students grasp the concept in a real-world way. By creating a storyboard students will visualize the \"if\" and \"then\" scenarios. This visual aid helps solidify their understanding and provides a clear reference point when writing their own conditional statements with the micro:bit. It provides a fun and engaging context for them to learn about conditionals. They can connect with the characters and the cause-and-effect nature of the story.\n\n**Find the student handout for this project <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xNxJFtpb9VI8miyTx3TitTUJGPYNMl1j-ALE1e2Qk2s/template/preview\" target=\"_blank\">here.</a>**\n\n**Find the Three Little Pigs story <a href=\"https://youtu.be/CtP83CWOMwc?si=bVG-sYcYeaBTrAfL\" target=\"_blank\">here.</a>**",

All of a sudden, our chorus would be a function of repeated actions, rather than words.\r\n- Use the concepts of the arrows from the Graph Paper Programming lesson and create a program with lots of repeating instructions.\r\n\t- Circle those repeating actions so that the class can see where they are.\r\n\t- Define a function called \"Chorus\" above the program.\r\n\t- Cross out everywhere the repeating actions appear in the program and write \"Chorus\" instead.\r\n- Repeat until the class can go through this process with little direction."

In a function declaration, you fill in the function with code and you give the function a name. You must declare a function before you can use it.\n\n2. **The Call**:\n\tFunction calls are what makes the program run the code in the function. To call a function, you place the name of the function in your program. Make sure your function is properly defined before calling it in your program.\n    \nThe class can use songwriting as an example to understand these two components. In the unplugged activity, the function containing the lyrics to the chorus was named \"chorus\". When we first made this function, we circled the lyrics that would go in the function. Once we named the function, we could read through the lyrics and replace the repeated chorus lyrics with a function call to \"chorus\".\n\nContinue the conversation until students have a basic understanding of functions being declared and called. If students don't get to this point, make sure to do one of the bridging activities before moving into the Code.org puzzles."
