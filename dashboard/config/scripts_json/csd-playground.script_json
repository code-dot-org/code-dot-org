The second goal is for students to understand how the draw loop allows them to create this behavior in Game Lab. Students should leave the lesson understanding that the commands in the draw loop are called after all other code but are then called repeatedly to create animation.

        "description": "Once groups have selected a specific innovative device, they can complete the second page of this activity guide, which asks them to do the following:\n\n* **What Problem Does It Solve?:** For some topics this may be more clear (for example healthcare devices typically have a very specific goal), but for others students may need to think more broadly about what they consider problems. More frivolous wearables or digital art installations may be more concerned with personal expression than solving a specific problem.\n* **What Is Innovative About It?:** Encourage students to refer back to the earlier discussion about innovation for this. It can also be useful to compare against other devices found during the research phase.\n* **How Do You Interact With It?:** Ask students to think back to the _Input, Output, Storage, Processing_ model that was introduced way back in Unit 1. The goal here is to identify specifically the Inputs and Outputs provided by a given device - the more specific these are, the more easily students will be able to connect elements of the Circuit Playground to these devices.\n* **What is the Impact?:** Encourage students to think of the people who are affected by this innovation. Most innovations were probably designed to improve someone's life, and students can write about the impact this could have on individuals. But some devices may have unexpected or unintended consequences, and students can reflect on how those consequences could affect individuals.",
