Students learn to evaluate, prioritize, and effectively incorporate suggestions to enhance their computer vision projects. The lesson emphasizes the importance of being responsive to user needs and adjusting designs accordingly through a structured activity involving a categorization method (Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Will Not Have). By the end of this lesson, students should have a refined prototype that better meets the needs of their target users.",
        "preparation": "* Gather enough of each type of object used in the Warm-up activity for each group of two to three students so that each group has a physical object to work with during the activity. \n* Create or arrange the materials for students to categorize feedback (e.g., sticky notes in various colors, digital platforms like Miro or Google Slides for virtual categorization, and printed templates for feedback organization).\n* Ensure that necessary tools for prototype iteration are ready and accessible. This could involve software for digital prototypes or materials like paper, markers, and model-making supplies for physical prototypes.\n",
        "student_overview": "**How can user feedback inform the iterative nature of the Design Thinking Process?**\n\nToday, we'll examine the feedback you've received on your prototypes. You'll learn how to categorize this feedback based on its importance and urgency, which will help you decide which suggestions to implement first. This process is crucial for refining your project to ensure it effectively meets the needs of its users. By prioritizing and acting on the most critical feedback, you'll make your project more robust and user-friendly."

And even if it did, it was also likely that there could be an 'X' drawn that did not account for the algorithm. Traditional algorithmic thinking has specific conditions to check for, but even in an example as small as this 9x9 grid, we can see that it is difficult, if not impossible, to account for all of the variations. It is important to point out that one of the main goals of computer vision technologies is to be able to train computers to recognize an 'X'-- in addition to other objects– in new and novel implementations."

Gathering and visualizing data in this way can very quickly point out important areas of focus when designing products. There is an opportunity to make an inference about the second largest bar in the graph which indicates folks that are not concerned about it. You might want to prompt students and ask why people might not be worried (they live in an apartment with one floor, for instance). This will connect to the idea of creating User Personas which will be the focus of the next lesson.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-comments\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discuss:** _What feature might help address this need?_\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-lightbulb-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discussion Goal:** Here, students can speculate as to how robot vacuums might overcome this challenge. A main point is that there needs to be a camera or other sensor built into the machine that can identify and avoid areas where there is a sudden drop. Ideally, this should be something that the robot can determine on its own, rather than having to have users erect barriers or use other means to discourage the robot from tipping over the edge."

Encourage the students to try different chart types within the Editor, seeing which one best fits their data. Creating visualizations for qualitative data in Sheets is difficult! Ways that students could overcome this challenge would be to look at the most important words in the data and to keep track of the frequency with which these words appear. With the data presented in that fashion, a histogram could be created that would highlight the most used terms, and thus, indicate what might be most important to users. \\[Advanced] Formulas such as =SUM() and =AVERAGE() can be used to aggregate data.",

If students share answers where the connection to self-driving cars isn’t immediately apparent from the video, ask them to say more so that others can hear about the thinking that connects the two.",

The first pattern that they may see is the bullseye-looking one in the upper left/right and bottom left corners. These are called Position Markers. Students might realize that they are there to help align the image when it is scanned so that the scanner knows which end is up and which end is down. On the larger QR Codes, they might also see smaller bullseye patterns repeating at regular intervals. These are designed to help the QR Code scanner normalize an image – that is, correct is perspective if the camera takes an image at an angle and warps the QR square.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-comments\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discuss:** _How do you think QR codes store information?_\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-lightbulb-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discussion Goal:** Discuss the structure of QR codes, including the black and white squares, and how these patterns translate into digital data that can be read by a scanner or smartphone camera. Since there are only filled and non-filled squares, make a connection to the Warm-up in which you discussed bits (binary digits). The squares could represent 1s or 0s if they are filled or not filled. Some students might point out that you need set an order in which to “read” the bits of data, otherwise any binary message that is contained in the QR Code would get scrambled. Therefore, it is important to agree to a set of rules that helps us to encode and decode the bits in a certain order.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-video-camera\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Video:** Show the video \"How do QR Codes Work: Explained in Minutes\".\n\n**Questions to consider with the video:**\n* What surprises you about how QR codes work?\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-lightbulb-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discussion Goal:** Students highlight different aspects of QR codes that surprised them, such as the different elements, error correction, or how it encodes data.",

It may appear as though the filter is instant. However, other more complex filters might have a brief delay before the image is rendered completely. Students might point out that the size of the image affects how long it takes to process – the bigger the image, the slower the processing. It might also depend on the device that is used. Chromebooks, iPads, phones, and MacBook Pros all have different speeds that they can process information. Students might also point out that processing a video takes longer than an image since each frame of a video is essentially an image in and of itself."

This is a good point and we will circle back around to this when students look to revise their algorithms. Students might also point out that differences in brightness might occur horizontally or vertically. Set a threshold value– if a pixel’s value is below (or above) the threshold value, then it is discarded. In this way, we can begin to segment or slice up an image. Finding a good threshold value might be a challenge. Use a grid to overlay the image so that you are focused on a small space at a time."

This greatly boosts performance of filtering algorithms. Reduce the color values - we learned that all pixels contain at least a red, green, and blue value (some also include an alpha, or transparency value). We can average the three values together to form one number which will display as grayscale (0 - black / 255 - white / all other values - shades of gray).\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-comments\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discuss:** _To increase the processing speed of your algorithm, was there a compromise that needed to be made elsewhere?_\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-lightbulb-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discussion Goal:** An important point here is that introducing efficiencies often means reducing the fidelity of the image in some way. In the two examples referenced above, sampling an image permanently gets rid of lots of pixels within an image, and while we can infer what those might be, it is impossible to recover that data. This is similar to working with color. When we convert an image to grayscale, we lose the unique color values that are present in the pixels."

Different Results with Small Changes: They may observe that slight changes (like moving the object closer or further, changing angles, or altering lighting) can lead to different recognition results. Needs Examples to Understand: The machine requires examples to learn what an object looks like; it doesn't \"know\" anything until it's shown examples.

Here are some common questions students might have after a short, five minute session with Teachable Machine: Why does it sometimes get it wrong? Students might be curious about why the machine doesn't always recognize objects correctly, even if they've just shown it similar examples. Does it remember what we showed it? They could wonder if the Teachable Machine retains the information from their session for the next time it's used. Can it learn to recognize me? Some students might be intrigued by the possibility of the machine learning to recognize them personally or specific gestures they make. How does it know what it's seeing so fast? The immediate feedback from the Teachable Machine might lead students to question how it processes information quickly. What else can it learn to do? Curiosity about the scope of Teachable Machine's learning capabilities, wondering if it can learn tasks beyond simple object or gesture recognition.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-check-square-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Do This:** Direct students to discuss what kind of model(s) they want to create with their project group.
