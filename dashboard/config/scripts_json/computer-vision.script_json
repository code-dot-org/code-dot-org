        "description": "<i class=\"fa fa-comments\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discuss:** _How might we create an algorithm so that a computer can see the difference between \"X\" and \"O\"?_\n\n**Discussion Goal:** A simple algorithm that students might come up with is to test whether the corners are filled in; if so, then it must be an X. They might also suggest to test to see if the lines present cross each other. Encourage students to come up with as many rules / steps as they are able to in the amount of time given. Teaching Tip Consider having students talk to a shoulder partner for a minute or two to discuss and work out an algorithm before beginning a whole class discussion.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-comments\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discuss:** _Does your algorithm work for the examples of an \"X\" seen here? Why or why not?_\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-lightbulb-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discussion Goal:** No matter how detailed the algorithm was that students created previously, it is highly likely that it didn’t account for some variation of the 'X' seen here. And even if it did, it was also likely that there could be an 'X' drawn that did not account for the algorithm. Traditional algorithmic thinking has specific conditions to check for, but even in an example as small as this 9x9 grid, we can see that it is difficult, if not impossible, to account for all of the variations. It is important to point out that one of the main goals of computer vision technologies is to be able to train computers to recognize an 'X'-- in addition to other objects– in new and novel implementations.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-video-camera\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Video:** How AI Works: Computer Vision (2:24 to 3:46)\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-comments\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discuss:** _When teaching a computer to \"see\", how does machine learning differ from traditional programming?_\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-lightbulb-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discussion Goal:** With traditional programming, we often hard-code in certain assumptions and conditions– like it might be an X shape if the center pixel filled in. However, that doesn’t account for situations where the X shape is askew or transformed across the canvas. Machine learning allows a computer to use data to develop an algorithm for itself. The more data that the computer has, the more accurate the guess that it can make becomes. Machine learning finds patterns by learning from its mistakes.",

For this, let's return to the example of FarmWise employees volunteering on farms, and interviewing farmers.\n\nWe already discussed some things that the FarmWise employees might have learned from their interviews. Let's break down the process of gathering that information a little bit more, starting with some observations that the designers might have made while volunteering as part of the farming community: lack of access to enough water, trouble finding enough workers to hire, and challenges minimizing the loss of crops due to pests and disease.\n\nThese problems and the needs associated with them might be obvious to members of the community. But, as designers, our job is to find out more about what our users need instead of making assumptions. To do this, we need to dig a bit deeper by talking with users, just like the FarmWise employees interviewed farmers.\n\nTurning these observations into research questions will help you, as a designer, gather more data about your users and help you more clearly define the problem you are trying to solve.\n\nHere is an example of a question that the employees at FarmWise might have asked to learn more about the issue of water scarcity. Can you think of questions they might ask about labor shortages, or pest and disease management?",

Gathering and visualizing data in this way can very quickly point out important areas of focus when designing products. There is an opportunity to make an inference about the second largest bar in the graph which indicates folks that are not concerned about it. You might want to prompt students and ask why people might not be worried (they live in an apartment with one floor, for instance). This will connect to the idea of creating User Personas which will be the focus of the next lesson.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-comments\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discuss:** _What feature might help address this need?_\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-lightbulb-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discussion Goal:** Here, students can speculate as to how robot vacuums might overcome this challenge.

Ideally, this should be something that the robot can determine on its own, rather than having to have users erect barriers or use other means to discourage the robot from tipping over the edge."

Encourage the students to try different chart types within the Editor, seeing which one best fits their data. Creating visualizations for qualitative data in Sheets is difficult! Ways that students could overcome this challenge would be to look at the most important words in the data and to keep track of the frequency with which these words appear.

The first pattern that they may see is the bullseye-looking one in the upper left/right and bottom left corners. These are called Position Markers. Students might realize that they are there to help align the image when it is scanned so that the scanner knows which end is up and which end is down. On the larger QR Codes, they might also see smaller bullseye patterns repeating at regular intervals. These are designed to help the QR Code scanner normalize an image – that is, correct is perspective if the camera takes an image at an angle and warps the QR square.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-comments\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discuss:** _How do you think QR codes store information?_\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-lightbulb-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discussion Goal:** Discuss the structure of QR codes, including the black and white squares, and how these patterns translate into digital data that can be read by a scanner or smartphone camera. Since there are only filled and non-filled squares, make a connection to the Warm-up in which you discussed bits (binary digits). The squares could represent 1s or 0s if they are filled or not filled. Some students might point out that you need set an order in which to “read” the bits of data, otherwise any binary message that is contained in the QR Code would get scrambled. Therefore, it is important to agree to a set of rules that helps us to encode and decode the bits in a certain order.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-video-camera\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Video:** Show the video \"How do QR Codes Work: Explained in Minutes\"\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-comments\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discuss:** _What surprises you about how QR codes work?_\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-lightbulb-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discussion Goal:** Students highlight different aspects of QR codes that surprised them, such as the different elements, error correction, or how it encodes data.",

In that step, we gathered data, made visualizations that helped us extract insight and meaning, and then used those insights to craft user personas that help create a hypothetical users in our target community. From our user personas, we created a problem statement to help clarify what might be in issue of greatest need for those users. Now we are moving onto Ideating.

Students might point out that the size of the image affects how long it takes to process – the bigger the image, the slower the processing. It might also depend on the device that is used. Chromebooks, iPads, phones, and MacBook Pros all have different speeds that they can process information. Students might also point out that processing a video takes longer than an image since each frame of a video is essentially an image in and of itself."

This is a good point and we will circle back around to this when students look to revise their algorithms. Students might also point out that differences in brightness might occur horizontally or vertically. Set a threshold value– if a pixel’s value is below (or above) the threshold value, then it is discarded. In this way, we can begin to segment or slice up an image. Finding a good threshold value might be a challenge. Use a grid to overlay the image so that you are focused on a small space at a time."

This greatly boosts performance of filtering algorithms. Reduce the color values - we learned that all pixels contain at least a red, green, and blue value (some also include an alpha, or transparency value). We can average the three values together to form one number which will display as grayscale (0 - black / 255 - white / all other values - shades of gray).\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-comments\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discuss:** _To increase the processing speed of your algorithm, was there a compromise that needed to be made elsewhere?_\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-lightbulb-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discussion Goal:** An important point here is that introducing efficiencies often means reducing the fidelity of the image in some way. In the two examples referenced above, sampling an image permanently gets rid of lots of pixels within an image, and while we can infer what those might be, it is impossible to recover that data. This is similar to working with color. When we convert an image to grayscale, we lose the unique color values that are present in the pixels."

You can't capture every single detail because your paper is much smaller, so you decide to pick just the most important bits to draw.\n\nWhen we take digital pictures or videos, we're capturing a vast amount of visual information. But sometimes, we need to reduce the size of these images for various reasons—maybe to save space on our phones, or to make websites load faster online. When we do this, we're faced with a challenge similar to shrinking our mural: we need to decide which details are crucial to keep and which ones we can leave out.\n\nWe are continuing our work from the previous lesson with the Ideate stage. As you brainstorm today, discuss if edge detection filtering might be necessary for your computer vision application.",

It is important to point out that there are many different ways of grouping the images – it could be based on similar objects that are detected in the scene (e.g. cooking utensils), on location (e.g. inside of a school), on attributes (e.g. clean vs. dirty / color palette), or context (e.g. it must be lunch time!). An important takeaway is that while there are many ways to group, sort, and label images, the most important consideration is the purpose behind what you are grouping. If we want a dataset that will help a computer vision application to identify objects in a scene, for instance, then labeling and classifying by object type would be the ideal way to group these images.\n\nAnother important conversation thread that could emerge is that it is often difficult (if not impossible!) to sort the images based on a singular object. If you made two categories- books and tables- there are images that contain one or the other, but also images that contain both. Therefore, being able to tag multiple objects within an image becomes important."

Let's imagine you are trying to teach a friend to recognize something they’ve never seen before. But, there’s a catch - you can only use images! This is similar to how we can train machine learning models in computer vision.\n\nWe provide them with examples, or \"training data\", to help them learn.\n\nAs you can see in these images, the same subject can be represented in various ways depending on our viewpoint. Each perspective offers unique information about the subject. These drawings range from a frontal view to a side view, and back perspectives. We could have even had a top-down view or a zoomed in view as well. Notice how each view captures different details? Think about why this diversity in data would be crucial for training algorithms to recognize objects.\n\nIt is now your turn to train your classmates! When you get your object card, make sure you do NOT show anyone! Keep this a secret!",

In the event a student states that they have not had to scrap or iterate on any ideas, encourage the student to think more broadly about the design and development process, emphasizing that iteration doesn't always mean making large, noticeable changes. Sometimes, iteration can be as subtle as tweaking a user interface element, adjusting the wording in instructions, or changing the flow of a process based on potential user feedback. Ask the student to reflect on any aspect of their project that required even minor adjustments or where they faced challenges, even if those challenges didn't lead to drastic changes.
