Using a login will also require parental permission, and being 13+\n* Bard is usable on personal Google accounts that have it enabled; school accounts will not allow it. \nAll three of those chatbots allow speech-to-text, translation, and are usable by a screen reader.\n\n"

Keep students looking for statements like “This might have been said by…” Also, note that sometimes the chatbot doesn’t say something like this but *still might be* making up the information.\n\nSome chatbots will also cite their sources and often provide links to follow. **Not all of the links are what the chatbots say they are.** Also, even when a website says the same thing as the chatbot, it does not guarantee that the information is correct; **it is always important to double-check all information on the internet - whether from an AI or a traditional search engine.**"
