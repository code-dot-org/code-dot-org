The question may also make students aware of their cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias (the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information to confirm preexisting beliefs or hypotheses). Try to get them to recognize how these biases can influence their acceptance of information as true without adequate verification. Encourage students to see the value in discovering they were wrong. This moment of realization is crucial for developing critical thinking and fact-checking skills.\n\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-comments\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discuss:** *Why is it important to verify information?*\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-lightbulb-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discussion Goal:** The central goal of asking students this explicit question is to foster an understanding of the critical role that information accuracy plays in various aspects of personal, academic, and societal life. This discussion aims to instill a sense of responsibility and diligence in handling information, emphasizing that verification is not just a skill but a fundamental aspect of being an informed and responsible member of society. Hopefully, students will have realized that there is a lot of misinformation in the world that they may have taken as fact. They should also realize that when they spread information without checking it, they are part of the problem.

The video discusses that misinformation and misleading information have always existed but that modern tools are making it easier to make and spread this misinformation. In turn, even correct information can plausibly seem like lies. The takeaway message is that the best defense against spreading misinformation is to stop and verify each source."
