Any chatbot that is not domain-specific (ie written specifically for medicine or finance, etc.) should work, though we have written the following guides: [r guide_to_microsoft_copilot/gen-ai-humanities/unversioned],\n[r guide_to_google_gemini/gen-ai-humanities/unversioned], and\n[r guide_to_chatgpt/gen-ai-humanities/unversioned]\n* First and foremost, you should use the chatbot you and your students can access. \n* ChatGPT requires a login and parent permission, and is only for 13+. \n* BingChat can be used without a login, but it will not keep track of discussion history. Using a login will also require parental permission, and being 13+\n* Bard is usable on personal Google accounts that have it enabled; school accounts will not allow it. \nAll three of those chatbots allow speech-to-text, translation, and are usable by a screen reader.\n\n"

How does it help your learning? How does it limit your learning?\n\n**Discussion:** Think/Pair/Share - Give students ~2 minutes to think and write, then ~2 minutes to share with a neighbor. After those two minutes, call on some students to share the answers.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-refresh\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Circulate:** Listen to students as they share with their neighbor. If students are stuck and can’t think of anything, ask them to consider technology like “a calculator” or “search engines” or “typing.” Ask them to consider what the technology might have done for them that they would have to learn, and what it allowed them to learn that might have been harder. Look for students with important or interesting points to pull up, and tell them you’d like them to share that answer when you reconvene as a class.  \n\n**Discussion Goal:** The class is going to be about how AI can be used as a tool in the writing process, and when that use is helpful vs harmful for learning. This discussion is meant to get students thinking about technology more broadly before narrowing in on AI. Generally, technology can replace learning specific skills, which might have a downside, but might also allow students to focus on higher order thinking skills rather than memorization and mechanics. \n\nPossible examples include:\n* Search Engine\n   * Detracts from learning\n      * Using a search engine rather than memorizing facts means that you do not know the facts if you need access to them without the internet. Knowing the facts by heart can help you form conclusions based on other facts.\n      * Not actually knowing the facts might make you more likely to believe misinformation available on the internet.\n      * Some people use search engines to find pre-written essays, which means they do not learn the things that writing the essay would have taught them.\n  * Supports learning\n       * Using a search engine for facts allows classes to focus on synthesizing those facts into higher-order conclusions rather than memorizing them.\n       * Search engines have access to more facts than a person can keep in their memory, which allows for more information.\n       * Search engines make checking the information you believe you know against other sources easier.\n* Typing. \n  * Detracts from learning\n       * Typing instead of handwriting does not help you develop manual dexterity.\n       * Typing instead of handwriting does not provide practice handwriting.\n       * Some studies have shown writing things by hand helps you remember them.\n  * Supports learning\n       * Typing instead of handwriting makes the content of your writing easier to read for others.\n       * Many people can type faster than they can handwrite, allowing them to work on other things faster, and allowing them to keep up with their thoughts as they write.\n"

The question may also make students aware of their cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias (the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information to confirm preexisting beliefs or hypotheses). Try to get them to recognize how these biases can influence their acceptance of information as true without adequate verification. Encourage students to see the value in discovering they were wrong.

Pick out a couple of sticky notes from the 2nd question on the poster to help drive the discussion of when to use a chatbot for research.\n\n**Discussion Goal:** The goal here is for students to recognize situations where a chatbot's conversational interface and thematic search capabilities are advantageous, such as when exploring less mainstream topics, combining ideas, accessing marginalized voices, or seeking a more engaging, interactive research experience. This reflection should enhance their understanding of the unique strengths of chatbots in information gathering.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: Display the slide for Station B. \n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discuss:**Have a quick discussion about the placement of sticky notes on the search engine usage scale.

Pick out a couple of sticky notes from the 2nd question on the poster to help drive the discussion of when (and even how) to use a search engine for research.\n\n**Discussion Goal:**  This short discussion aims to help students appreciate the effectiveness of search engines in quickly providing a vast array of information for straightforward, factual queries.

Pick out a couple of sticky notes from the 2nd question on the poster to help drive the discussion of ethical considerations when using either tool for research.\n\n**Discussion Goal:** The goal is to encourage students to think critically about the ethical dimensions of digital tools. They should reflect on issues like the spread of misinformation, the reliability of AI-generated content, and the challenges in accessing diverse perspectives. This discussion should foster awareness about responsible information consumption and sharing.\n",
