If a student feels stuck, ask them to read the instructions out loud to you and ask them to repeat back what the instructions say in their own words. \n  - <img src=\"https://images.code.org/5b99c663ad6632fe64c9da69d6805c2b-text-to-speech.PNG\" style=\"height: 25px;\"> Students can also click on this text-to-speech icon to hear the instructions read aloud.\n- <img src=\"https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/hint.png\" style=\"height: 35px;\"> **Look for hints**: Most levels include at least one hint with more explicit details about how to pass the level. \n- **Celebrate bugs:** Getting a bug in your code is a natural part of the coding process. If the program isn’t doing what they expected, ask the student to first tell you what they want to happen, click run to observe what is actually happening, then find the place in their code that caused the discrepancy. Remember to celebrate finding bugs and fixing bugs. Getting a bug means students are doing a great job building a more complex program. "
