These new properties impact the visual look of the web page beyond its text and give students more precise control over the layout of their pages. As students expand their knowledge of style properties, many may have questions about how they can do even more with CSS. Curious students can explore more properties at <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/\"> W3 Schools </a>.",

Once elements are in a class, the class can be used as a selector in a style rule. \r\n\r\nNote: Single elements can also be selected by id, but this type of selection is possible with a class applied only to that single element.

Talking about the organization, structure, or role of the content in the page (heading, paragraph, list, etc.) is more accurate than talking about specific aspects of its appearance (such as size or spacing).\n\nAlthough certain structural roles may be associated with appearance (headings are larger), HTML does not specify anything in particular about the appearance. This allows users with different needs, such as the visually impaired, to interact with the structured content in a way that makes the most sense for them. Later in the unit, students will learn about styles and CSS, which allows them to specify the exact size, color, and spacing of their HTML elements.\n\nThe paragraph tag separates text into paragraphs. You may want to follow up this question by asking students how they think a web browser for the blind might deal with paragraphs. For example, while sighted people may use spacing and new lines to separate out paragraphs, what should a screen reader do?"

In either case, use this discussion to motivate the content vs. structure wrap-up point.\r\n\r\nAs students discuss HTML as a solution, make sure that they are using the key vocabulary of the lesson: \r\n\r\n* **website content** - the text and images on a website\r\n* **website structure** - how the content of a website is organized \r\n* **HTML** - Hypertext Markup Language, a language used to create web pages\r\n* **HTML Element** - A piece of a website, marked by a start tag and often closed with an end tag\r\n* **HTML Tag** - The special set of characters that indicates the start and end of an HTML element and that element's type\r\n\r\nThe content is the literal words that are being typed on the page. Using HTML, students are providing structure to the page, explaining how those pieces of content should be interpreted. Later in the unit students will learn CSS, a language that allows them to individually style elements. For now, however, the styles being applied based on their HTML tags are just the default styles of their web browser. Students don't need to fully understand this difference at this point, as it will be much clearer once they learn CSS later in the unit.\r\n"

For debugging advice, students may give dispositional advice (\"Don't give up!\", \"Remember that it's normal\"), recommended resources (\"Ask a friend to look at it\", \"look at the map levels\"), process-based advice (\"describe the bug first, then look for it before you change stuff\", \"look at what's messed up and check the spelling in that part\"), or tools based advice (\"look above where the pink is\", \"use the inspector tool\").
