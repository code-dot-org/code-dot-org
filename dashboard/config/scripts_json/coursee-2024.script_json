If so, who is it and why? If not, why not? Take turns sharing with your partner._ ([Slide 4](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RSug3cMAa8L0oSCC2H7__NnAayjLdktVPWl_H5vArHM/edit#slide=id.g3e441b4e86_1_16))\n\nInvite students to share out. Follow up by asking students to name specific super powers from their favorite superhero. Point out that one thing that all superheroes have in common is that they use their powers to help other people.\n\n**Say**: _Today we're going to talk about how we can all be superheroes and help others. We're going to watch a video about being super digital citizens.

Their answers should be based on what the Super Digital Citizen helps Guts do:\n\n* _Changes his password to be secure._\n* _Protects his tablet with a case and carries it in his backpack so that it won't break._\n* _Asks permission from Heart first before sharing a photo of her online._\n\n**Ask**: _You might have noticed that Guts became a superhero too. How did he do that?_\n\nInvite students to respond. Explain that Guts became a superhero because he took steps to help himself and others be responsible online. Define **digital citizen** as _someone who uses technology responsibly to learn, create, and participate._ ([Slide 6](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RSug3cMAa8L0oSCC2H7__NnAayjLdktVPWl_H5vArHM/edit#slide=id.g3d894fa21b_0_30))",

Point out three ways that cyberbullying can be addressed:\n\n* Defending or supporting the person being bullied\n* Telling a trusted adult\n* Addressing it directly with the bully\n\n**Explain** to students that doing any of these things makes you an upstander.

By creating an interactive poster with SpriteLab, students will apply their understanding of sharing personal and private information on the web. Students will further explore the CS concept of events as they provide feedback to a peer.\n\n*Standards Addressed:*\n\n- **CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.W.4.2.D:** Use precise language and domain-specific vocabulary to inform about or explain the topic.\n\n- **CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.SL.4.4:** Report on a topic or text, tell a story, or recount an experience in an organized manner, using appropriate facts and relevant, descriptive details to support main ideas or themes; speak clearly at an understandable pace.\n\n- **CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.4.MD.C.5.A:** An angle is measured with reference to a circle with its center at the common endpoint of the rays, by considering the fraction of the circular arc between the points where the two rays intersect the circle. An angle that turns through 1/360 of a circle is called a \"one-degree angle,\" and can be used to measure angles.\n\n- **CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.4.MD.C.5.B:** An angle that turns through n one-degree angles is said to have an angle measure of n degrees.\n"

If you are not projecting the slides onto a white board or smartboard that you can write on, just point to the block that matches each action on the list.   \n\n- **Main player sprite** [Answer: Red block- make new unicorn sprite]\n- **Opponent/Enemy Sprites** [Answer: Red block- make 3 new small fireball sprites]\n- **Main character’s movement** [Answer: Blue block- sprite unicorn begins moving with arrow keys]\n- **What happens when sprites touch?** [Answer: remove unicorn sprite and fireball says Game over!]\n- **Mountain scene in the background** [Answer: Purple block set background to mountain scene]\n- **Sprite explains how to play** [Answer: Blue block- unicorn says Avoid the fireballs!]\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: (next) Review slide\n\n**Discuss:** How do you play this game? How do you win/lose? \n\n**Discussion Goal:** By looking at the code, we can make a guess about how to play. We can see the unicorn’s behavior is set to moving with arrow keys so we know we will be controlling the unicorn with arrow keys. We see that the unicorn gives us instructions to “Avoid the fireballs!” so we know we have to try not to let the fireballs touch the unicorn. Under the event when unicorn touches fireball we see the unicorn goes away and the game is over so we can assume that’s how you would lose the game. By looking closely at each line of code, students will gain confidence and experience reading the code blocks and understanding the purpose of each block. ",

Here are some examples you might come up with:**\n- You spun ‘avoid’ & ‘grumpy cat’. In this game the grumpy cat tries to avoid the floating hearts. The variable would be named grumpyLevel and it would decrease when the cat touches the heart.\n- You spun ‘click’ and ‘sassy fox.’ In this game the player tries to click on the sassy fox but she keeps disappearing and changing her location so it’s challenging to catch her.

All of a sudden, our chorus would be a function of repeated actions, rather than words.\r\n- Use the concepts of the arrows from the Graph Paper Programming lesson and create a program with lots of repeating instructions.\r\n\t- Circle those repeating actions so that the class can see where they are.\r\n\t- Define a function called \"Chorus\" above the program.\r\n\t- Cross out everywhere the repeating actions appear in the program and write \"Chorus\" instead.\r\n- Repeat until the class can go through this process with little direction."

In a function declaration, you fill in the function with code and you give the function a name. You must declare a function before you can use it.\n\n2. **The Call**:\n\tFunction calls are what makes the program run the code in the function. To call a function, you place the name of the function in your program. Make sure your function is properly defined before calling it in your program.\n    \nThe class can use songwriting as an example to understand these two components. In the unplugged activity, the function containing the lyrics to the chorus was named \"chorus\". When we first made this function, we circled the lyrics that would go in the function. Once we named the function, we could read through the lyrics and replace the repeated chorus lyrics with a function call to \"chorus\".\n\nContinue the conversation until students have a basic understanding of functions being declared and called. If students don't get to this point, make sure to do one of the bridging activities before moving into the Code.org puzzles."

For example, apps can be used to request rides, recommend movies, or communicate with friends and family. Many people have access to a mobile device (e.g., smartphone) which makes it possible to use apps just about anywhere.\n\nWhile discussing, show screenshots or examples of apps on your smartphone or tablet if possible.\n\nEnsure that all students are on the same page regarding this topic by introducing key terms and concepts with the remarks below.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: Show \"What are apps?\" slide \n\n**Say**: \n\n- *In this course, we have been learning how to code.

Usually, apps more specifically refer to applications running on small computers called* _mobile devices._\n- *Smartphones and tablets are examples of mobile devices.*\n\nIntroduce accessibility with the remarks below.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: Show \"What is accessibility?\" slide\n\n**Say**: \n\n- *As apps become used by more and more people, app developers often come across issues that they had not considered, likely because they have never experienced those issues in their own lives.*\n- *Many of these issues are related to _accessibility._ In the world of computer science, accessibility is about creating technology for people with _disabilities._* \n- *Disabilities include physical, auditory, visual, and many others.*\n- *Disabilities are diverse and impact people in different ways. For example, someone who is slightly visually impaired might wear glasses. Someone who is severely visually impaired might be considered \"blind\" and will need more assistance.* \n\n**Transition**: Tell students you'd like to introduce them to a few kids who are just like them even though they have disabilities.",

While displaying a scenario image, read its accompanying script to the class (see below). Discussion questions are included in relevant slides.\n\n#### Designing for Accessibility Scenarios\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** Show \"Meet Wei\" slide\n\n* Wei is a talented kid who LOVES music. She plays piano and sings very well! \n* Wei is visually impaired. While she is not completely blind, it is very difficult for her to see things, even if they are near her eyes.\n* Wei has had to learn piano differently from kids who aren’t visually impaired, but that hasn’t stopped her from becoming a great musician! \n* Wei recently began creating her own music. She is very proud of it! She would like to record and share her music with her friends.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** Show \"Introducing Grammaphone!\" slide\n\n* Grammaphone is a popular new app that allows people to upload and share their own music with friends. \n\n**Discuss**: What do you think about this app? How do you think this app works?\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** Show \"Wei and Grammaphone\" slide\n\n* Wei needs to use Grammaphone to share her music. After all, it’s the most popular music-sharing app!\n* However, she’s having a difficult time using the app. Why do you think that is? \n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** Show \"Meet Roger\" slide\n\n* Roger is an energetic kid who loves video games! He especially likes playing sports games with his friends.\n* Things have been hard for Roger lately, though. A few years ago, Roger’s hand had to be “amputated” (surgically removed) due to an accident. \n* Thankfully, computer scientists, engineers, and doctors are working hard to provide Roger with a cool-looking robotic “prosthetic hand,” which will be awesome!\n* But for now, Roger wants to play sports video games with his friends! \n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** Show \"Introducing Football Frenzy!\" slide\n\n* Football Frenzy is a new mobile game that everyone loves!\n* It has cool graphics, awesome sound effects, tight controls, and amazing action!\n\n**Discuss**: What do you think about this app? How do you think this game is played?\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** Show \"Roger and Football Frenzy\" slide\n\n* All of Roger’s friends play Football Frenzy. It’s connected online so that you can play it anywhere!\n* Roger wants to play Football Frenzy with them, but he is having a difficult time. Why do you think that is?\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** Show \"Designing for Accessibility\" slide\n\n* Neither of these apps was designed with people like Wei and Roger in mind.\n* When it comes to these apps, what specific features do you think Wei and Roger wish for? \n* Let’s redesign these apps! \n\n####App Redesign Activity (25 min)\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: “Your turn!” slide\n\nThe final scenario allows students to sketch a redesign of one app from the scenarios (\"Grammaphone\" for Wei or \"Football Frenzy\" for Roger). \n\nStudents should primarily focus their efforts on making their redesigned app more accessible for either of them, along with any other accessibility features they can think of. Students can design as many screens for the app as they wish, and they do not need to make their app look anything like the original examples.\n\nIf there is time, students may redesign apps for both characters.\n\n**Distribute**: Pass out crayons/pencils/etc. to each student as they open their reflection journals. \n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: “Share Out” slide\n\n**Share**: After designing, students share their app design with a neighbor, or if there is time, some students can share with the whole class. Each student should answer how their app design addresses the need of the user in question."
