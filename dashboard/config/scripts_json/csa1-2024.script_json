Additionally, you must be a* ***verified teacher*** *to run Java Lab code. If you attended a Code.org 5-day workshop during the summer, you should already have this access.*\n\nTo check if you have access:\n1. Navigate to the [**Unit 1 Overview**](https://studio.code.org/s/csa1).\n2. Do you see the **CSA Pre-Course Survey** at the top of the unit overview page?\n3. If not, you need to verify your teacher account. Please fill out [**this form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdGGAJuaDMBVIRYnimPhAL96w6fCl4UdvhwmynGONM75TWwWw/viewform). Note that it can take 5-7 business days to become a verified teacher, so please do this step early!\n4. If you are *not* a verified teacher account, you can still create a section for your class, but you will not be able to administer the pre-course survey on the first day, and your students will not be able to run code in Java Lab.\n\n**Do This:** Create a class section on Code Studio.\n\n1. Navigate to [**My Dashboard**](https://studio.code.org/home).\n2. Click **New section** under **Classroom Sections**.\n3. Choose **Email Logins**.\n   * If you are logged in through Google, you can choose to sync to your Google Classroom.\n4. Give your section a name, and choose the most appropriate grade level of students in your class.\n5. Set the course to be **CSA**.\n6. Set the unit to be **Unit 1: Object-Oriented Programming**.\n7. *If you're NOT using Google Classroom:* Once the section is created, click the name of the section to show the unique \"join link\" for your section.\n",
