The primary goal of this activity is to broaden students' perspectives about how programming can be used to make fun or entertaining things. Some of the fields that students could research (such as art, animation, and games) can be directly connected to programs they will write later in this unit, while others may serve more as an inspiration for how the skills that they learn here may be applied in different domains.\n\n#### Topics\n\nIn the activity guide there are a number of potential fields for research. These specific fields were chosen to go along with resources that are provided on Code Studio, but you can have students look into other fields if they wish."

        "description": "**Circulate** As students search the web, they may need support in staying focused on the research task. The goal of this exploration is twofold:\r\n\r\n  * First, develop a deeper understanding of how programming is used in the chosen field. How is computer technology changing this field, and what are some of the problems that people are trying to solve with technology?\r\n  * Second, identify some interesting applications of CS or facts to share. What are some cool things that people are doing in this field that make use of CS?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Interesting Information\r\n\r\nOnce groups have learned a bit about how CS is used in their chosen field, they can complete the second page of the activity guide, which asks them to do the following:\r\n\r\n* **What Problem Does It Solve?:** \"Problem\" in this context can be fairly broad. It might be simplifying an otherwise laborious or complex task, doing things that wouldn't otherwise be possible, or any number of things that make this form of entertainment more accessible to end users.\r\n* **How is it an Improvement?:** This could be tightly coupled with the answer to the previous question. Push students to consider how their form of entertainment was created before programming was prevalent.\r\n* **An Interesting Fact or Use:** Share something fun or interesting about how CS is used in this field.\r\n* **An Open Question:** It's likely that students come away with more questions than answers after just some quick research. Encourage them to reflect on what they don't yet know, and what questions they'd still like answered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Share:** Give groups a minute each to share their findings.",

The grid we learned about today is one solution to this problem but there are many others that could've worked. In fact, a lot of you probably noticed that the grid in Game Lab is \"flipped\". Computer screens come in all different shapes and sizes, as does the content we show on them. We need to agree on one point where all the content can grow from. Since we read starting at the top left corner, the grid on a computer screen starts at the top left corner as well. There's also the benefit of not having to use any negative numbers to talk about locations on the screen. Don't worry if this flipped grid is a little tricky still. We'll have plenty more time to work on it in coming lessons.",

Consider having students think of their own prediction and discuss with a partner before typing in their response. Once they're run the code, bring the class together for a full-group discussion to discuss how their predictions were similar or different from the resulting program. Use this as an opportunity to address any misconceptions that students may have had about the code initially.\n\n**Caution: Predict Entries Can't Be Deleted!** Once you enter an answer into the predict box, you are not able to reset it. This can make it difficult to repeat this process with multiple classes. Instead, we recommend entering dummy text like \"Class discussion\" and running the code. This way, the answer isn't \"spoiled\" for future classes. However, this means you will need to keep track of predictions separately such as on a whiteboard or in a document."

The most important aspect for students to understand is that sprites allow them to organize a lot of information about something that they want to draw to the screen.\n\nStudents should make the connection between properties and variables, that both hold information that their program needs to run. Properties are accessed through their sprites, and Game Lab sprites already have specific properties that are automatically created when students create each sprite, such as x position, height, and rotation.\n\nSprites solve the problem of organizing a lot of information about how something should be drawn to a screen. Rather than creating new variables to hold all of that information, sprites use properties to hold all of the information about one thing that is drawn to the screen.\n\n**Content Corner:** The sprite is a type of data called an object. While we aren't yet explicitly introducing the concept of objects, students do need to understand that a sprite is a different type of value from the ones we've seen before, one that can hold references to many more values."

Students may be confused by the use of the word \"animation\" for single images, but in Game Lab, still images are considered \"animations\" with only one frame.\n\nStudents can use an animation already in the animation tab library, upload one from their computer, or create their own using the provided drawing tools. Additionally, students can use the drawing tools to modify the images they have chosen from the library or uploaded.\n\n**Misconception Alert!**\nMany students may now confuse the concepts of a sprite, its animation, and the image that it draws to the screen. In the next few lessons, watch out for this misconception, and reinforce the idea that a sprite's animation is just one of its properties, the one that controls what image is drawn to the screen. Remind students that a single sprite may have different animations throughout the course of the program, just as other properties can change, and that two or more sprites might share the same animation."

You may decide to extend these projects as a way to support or challenge students, which could allow you to revisit difficult concepts or support students who may have missed lessons and are trying to catch up. However, we recommend deciding this ahead of time and being firm with students about how much time they have for each project - otherwise, it's easy for projects to drag-out to multiple days and for student's work to spiral beyond the scope of this project."

To help smooth out the debugging experience, consider the following strategies:\n\n- Review the [Teacher Guide to Debugging](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-mXz53CAQ1dy3-RVGkoUnR0hfAwdWeza4kch6NAvLb8/edit) for some common questions and strategies to help support students in debugging their code\n- Have students follow the steps in the [Student Guide to Debugging](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wNwoKDyoUas5GGkhqGmNN1u0XGQEdeOMWhSziyYIf8o/edit#) and use the [Bug Report Quarter-Sheets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M6mnq73DfyvzasucVAwfL-gjl2JqVPzjy_fRx5j4j7c/preview) as an initial step in the debugging process. This helps students prepare and communicate their issue before asking for help.\n- If students haven't seen it yet, consider showing the [Debugging Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auv10y-dN4s) to the class to reinforce debugging best practices.\n\n**Digging Deeper:** Consider supplying students with an object to talk to as part of the debugging process.

They should understand that the counter pattern allows the programmer to update the value of a variable in a pattern that counts up (or down) on every iteration of the draw loop. This can be used for many different things, such as spinning, growing, shrinking, or timers, but it's most often used to move sprites across the screen.\n\nWhen a sprite's x or y property is updated in a counter pattern, its position changes in a consistent way over time, causing it to move across the screen. Students should be able to explain that movement in an animation is just a change in position, and that changing a sprite's x position will cause it to move horizontally, and changing a sprite's y position will cause it to move vertically."

To help smooth out the debugging experience, consider the following strategies:\n\n- Review the [Teacher Guide to Debugging](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-mXz53CAQ1dy3-RVGkoUnR0hfAwdWeza4kch6NAvLb8/edit) for some common questions and strategies to help support students in debugging their code\n- Have students follow the steps in the [Student Guide to Debugging](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wNwoKDyoUas5GGkhqGmNN1u0XGQEdeOMWhSziyYIf8o/edit#) and use the [Bug Report Quarter-Sheets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M6mnq73DfyvzasucVAwfL-gjl2JqVPzjy_fRx5j4j7c/preview) as an initial step in the debugging process. This helps students prepare and communicate their issue before asking for help.\n- If students haven't seen it yet, consider showing the [Debugging Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auv10y-dN4s) to the class to reinforce debugging best practices.\n\n**Digging Deeper:** Consider supplying students with an object to talk to as part of the debugging process.

This helps students prepare and communicate their issue before asking for help.\n- If students haven't seen it yet, consider showing the [Debugging Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auv10y-dN4s) to the class to reinforce debugging best practices.\n\n**Digging Deeper:** Consider supplying students with an object to talk to as part of the debugging process.

The immediate answer is that the velocity block allows a programmer to set the velocity at the beginning of the program and not have to worry about the counter pattern inside the draw loop (as Game Lab will take care of that). If students are having trouble of thinking of situations in which the velocity block provides a big advantage, assure them that they will tackle some problems in the coming lesson that they will need this block for.\n\nAs students give you examples, try to elicit answers that use both positive and negative numbers, and that use the x and y positions as well as sprite rotation."

This helps students prepare and communicate their issue before asking for help.\n- If students haven't seen it yet, consider showing the [Debugging Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auv10y-dN4s) to the class to reinforce debugging best practices.\n\n**Digging Deeper:** Consider supplying students with an object to talk to as part of the debugging process.

They are designed for 1-2 days of implementation as a way to check-in with how well students understand the course content so far. You may decide to extend these projects as a way to support or challenge students, which could allow you to revisit difficult concepts or support students who may have missed lessons and are trying to catch up. However, we recommend deciding this ahead of time and being firm with students about how much time they have for each project - otherwise, it's easy for projects to drag-out to multiple days and for student's work to spiral beyond the scope of this project."

To help smooth out the debugging experience, consider the following strategies:\n\n- Review the [Teacher Guide to Debugging](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-mXz53CAQ1dy3-RVGkoUnR0hfAwdWeza4kch6NAvLb8/edit) for some common questions and strategies to help support students in debugging their code\n- Have students follow the steps in the [Student Guide to Debugging](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wNwoKDyoUas5GGkhqGmNN1u0XGQEdeOMWhSziyYIf8o/edit#) and use the [Bug Report Quarter-Sheets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M6mnq73DfyvzasucVAwfL-gjl2JqVPzjy_fRx5j4j7c/preview) as an initial step in the debugging process. This helps students prepare and communicate their issue before asking for help.\n- If students haven't seen it yet, consider showing the [Debugging Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auv10y-dN4s) to the class to reinforce debugging best practices.\n\n**Digging Deeper:** Consider supplying students with an object to talk to as part of the debugging process. This is sometimes known as Rubber Duck Debugging - you can learn more on the website https://rubberduckdebugging.com/"
