Students will identify various values for the variables found in food chains (Example: plants, animals, decomposer, etc.) as they document these values on notecards and show the movement of matter through an environment. Students will also learn about the 10% Rule and further describe energy flow with a writing prompt.\n\n*Standards Addressed:*\n * **CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.W.5.2.B:** Develop the topic with facts, definitions, concrete details, quotations, or other information and examples related to the topic.\n\n* **CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.5.NF.B.7.C:** Solve real world problems involving division of unit fractions by non-zero whole numbers and division of whole numbers by unit fractions, e.g., by using visual fraction models and equations to represent the problem. \n\n* **NGSS.5-LS2-1:** Develop a model to describe the movement of matter among plants, animals, decomposers, and the environment. \n"

Answer: Variables can store information like a name or a number. \n- How is a variable like something else we have in class? Answer: Perhaps students have a desk or cubby with their name on it. The desk or cubby is like a “variable” that holds their information or their papers or their lunch. \n- What is a variable label? Answer: It is the name the coder gives the variable. \n- Why do we need a variable label? Answer: To keep track of the variable in case we want to use it again later. \n- In the example program in Level 1, what is being stored in the variable labeled “word1”? Answer: What the user types into the text field under the prompt. \n- Can a variable name have a space in it? No, variable labels can only be one word.\n"

Ask a student who is done with their program to user test their program with a student who is feeling stuck. Ask them to work together to debug any code. \n\n3.  Pair Program: Ask elbow partners who might benefit from talking through their code out loud to work together by methodically working on one person’s program and then the other person’s program. One student should be the driver, while the other is the navigator. [See Preparation Section at the top of this lesson plan for more details].
