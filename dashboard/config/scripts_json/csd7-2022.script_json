        "description": "**Starting with Problem Solving:** We recommend teaching the first three lessons from the [Problem Solving and Computing unit](/s/csd1-2022), which introduces the Problem Solving Process referenced throughout the course. These lessons also include a pre-survey that you can administer to students.\n\n**Getting Started with Code.org:** Consider watching our [Getting Started with Code.org](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNdX7P76yGw7YUM4Csm1ZZmM) video series for an overview of how to navigate lesson plans, setup a classroom section, and other important features of the Code.org platform. Each video also has a support article if you'd prefer to read or print instructions - [click here to learn more](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/4405629586957-New-how-to-walkthrough-videos-for-teachers-).\n\n**Setup a Classroom Section:** You can use a class section in Code.org to manage your students, view their progress, and assign specific curriculum - [click here to learn more](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/115000488132-Creating-a-classroom-section).\n\nIf you are using a learning management system, there may be additional steps to sync your classes with Code.org:\n\n- [Click here](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/115001319312-Setting-up-sections-with-Google-Classroom-sync) for steps to setup your classes with Google Classroom\n- [Click Here](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/115002716111-Setting-up-sections-with-Clever-sync) for steps to setup your classes with Clever\n\n**Become a Verified Teacher:** Lesson plans and levels have additional resources and answer keys for Verified Teachers, which is quick process that verifies your position at an educational institution. [Click here to complete a form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdGGAJuaDMBVIRYnimPhAL96w6fCl4UdvhwmynGONM75TWwWw/viewform) and you should have access to verified teacher resources in ~1 business day. Verified teachers also have access to the [\"Teacher's Lounge\"](https://forum.code.org/c/csd/csd-teachers-lounge/444) section of the forums.\n\n**Get Inspired:** Consider watching our [Teacher Tips video playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNcc7Q-PvUVqV249l2JzhJes), featuring current CS Discoveries teachers.\n\n**Introducing App Lab:**  This unit assumes students are already familiar with App Lab. If you have students who have not worked in App Lab and Design Mode before, consider spending some additional class time introducing just enough App Lab to students for them to be successful in this unit. For example, by having students complete the [App Lab Hour of Code Tutorial](https://studio.code.org/s/applab-intro/reset)",

Students will probably say they primarily use eyes and mouth to help determine expression, but when they click the Information icon on the final screen, A.I.

This exercise also surfaces some important problems that will be important throughout the unit, such as when too much conflicting data can confuse AI Bot and lower accuracy or when AI Bot _thinks_ it knows something with high accuracy but with features that are not practical in the real-world."

Interacting with this version of the survey can be more personalized, since students can see data from other students within the class.\n\n**App Lab Experience:** This is the first lesson where students will use App Lab. If students have not seen App Lab before, you might consider postponing this lesson and instead spending a few extra class periods introducing students to App Lab and Design Mode.

Have the class consider whether gender feels like a necessary question, or if other questions will also lead to accurate recommendations.

Instead of the one or two word description from the pre-generated design elements, students will use the same questions they saw in the survey.\n- **Level 4:** Students will choose a theme to update the design of their app. For now, just have them choose a theme. Later on, they can continue to customize their app with Design Mode\n- **Level 5:** Students add a home screen to their app. The instructions for this level may be difficult to keep track of - encourage students to “check off” each step as they complete it. They can also use the animated example on the level as a guide for how to complete this task.\n- **Level 6:** Students add a button from the home screen to the predict screen, and add an event to connect the two screens together. Support students in reading through the instructions and “checking off” each piece as they go along. They can also click the “Show Me How” lines in the instructions for screenshots of what each step can look like.",

Students can access a resource in the Help and Tips section of Code Studio that explains how to select a label in AI Lab\n\n**Revisiting Past Screens:** Let students know it’s okay to go back and revisit past screens to improve their model or make different decisions - this is an important part of the process and something students should practice in this level. Students may find themselves starting to move fluently between the testing, feature, and label screens as they refine and improve their machine learning model.\n\n**Level 2 - Where Are The Tables?** In level 2, students predict the type of animal that they are looking at (like mammal, reptile, etc). This column has too many possible values, and so many data visualization tables won't appear. This is intentional, since it challenges students to use feature iteration and the Previous Results screens intentionally to find features that work. They need to trust that, if there are patterns in the data, AI Bot will find them and produce an accurate model even when there's too much data to visualize. This also prepares students for more realistic examples where there are typically more than 4 or 5 values for a feature.\n\n**Accuracy and Data Representation**: Students may be able to discover some curious combinations that give 100% accuracy. This may be because the particular features they chose are not well represented in the dataset - for example, only 8 out of the 100 animals are considered Venomous. This could lead to inflated accuracy, especially if those animals are not well represented in the testing set. If you notice students training models like this, ask them to thoroughly test their models and compare the results to their real-world experiences to make sure the model matches reality. Remind them that just because a model has high accuracy on its testing data doesn't mean it will have high accuracy in the real world."

This tends to happen when using more than 6 features in a model.\n\nThis particular problem is addressed in later lessons, but if students encounter it here, there are two strategies you can use to help students fix this:\n\n**Strategy #1: Make New Elements.** Students can use design mode to drag out new elements to use in their app. They may also decide to move the elements to different screens to help make the app easier to use. After adding these new design mode elements, students will need to update their code to use the new elements as well.\n\n**Strategy #2: Reposition Elements.** Even though the elements are off the screen, you can use Design Mode to manually select them and re-position them so they are on the screen. This involves changing the y-position property to 0 so it is on the screen, and then re-arranging the element like you would normally."

This is a step that will be important when students create their own custom apps in later projects.\n- **Level 4 and 5:** Students are only updating the code of their app to use the new design elements for the Number of Cars and Weather features. They can use the hints within the level instructions for clues on what to do in each step.\n- **Level 6:** Students update both the design and the code of their app to collect data for the Temperature feature. Help students keep track of the new text input element they add to the temperature screen, and make sure the ID of the element matches the one they use in the [`getText`(#fff176)](/docs/applab/getText/) block of their code.\n- **Level 7:** Students update both the design and the code of their app to collect data for the Time of Day feature. Adding the design element and updating the code is similar to the last level, but this step has the added requirement of using the Model Card to check the possible values are for this categorical feature. Students may make spelling or capitalization errors that can effect their code - encourage students to be very careful to match their dropdown options exactly with the model card.\n- **Level 8:** Students have a chance to run their app and verify that it works. Students will only need to make changes to the code on this level if their program doesn't work. Otherwise, if the app works correctly, students can continue to the next level."

After adding these new design mode elements, students will need to update their code to use the new elements as well. Students can refer to [Lesson 13](../13), especially level 1, as an example of how to update their code to fix this problem.\n\n**Strategy #2: Reposition Elements.** Even though the elements are off the screen, you can use Design Mode to manually select them and re-position them so they are on the screen. This involves changing the y-position property to 0 so it is on the screen, and then re-arranging the element like you would normally."

Students might suggest that Zoey collects more data before trying to train her model again.\n- **Isaac’s Data:** Isaac’s models will always be low because none of his features have a strong relationship to his label - students should notice that none of the Cross Tab charts have strong hot spots with any question. If students look at the questions themselves, they may notice that they don’t seem to have a strong relationship to the label Isaac is trying to predict. Students may recommend Isaac choose different questions and collecting his data again.\n- **Kim’s Data:** Kim’s models can be very accurate, but when students test the model they may find the questions and answer choices very specific and not inclusive - for example, the “favorite lunch food” question only contains meat options. Students may suggest that, even though the model is accurate, Kim may want to choose different questions that are more broad and inclusive rather than so specific.\n- **Nico’s Data:** Nico’s models can be very accurate, but when students test the model they may find that the majority of the recommendation is for the “Band Club” no matter what they pick. Students may need some prompting to notice this, but the data selection screen shows that Nico collected data primarily from people in a band, which biased his model towards recommending the Band club. Students may recommend Nico can avoid this next time by making sure he has a wide variety of people complete his survey."

There are a variety of factors that could make this difficult, especially if students didn't have a chance to collect enough data or the data doesn't lead to accurate models. Here are some strategies to help students move past these issues:\n\n- **Documenting in the Model Card**: Even if the data doesn't appear to create an accurate model, students can still use this data to complete the project as long as they document their decisions in the Model Card, especially in the Limitations section. Even though this means they are creating an app without an accurate model, it provides an opportunity for reflection on what could have gone differently in a future project.\n- **Use a pre-supplied dataset:** Several datasets are available in AI Lab for students to use if their survey data isn't leading to fruitful results. Students can use one of these datasets instead to complete their project. This may require adjusting the focus of their app, but students will at least be able to complete the project\n- **Exploring Advanced Datasets:** AI Lab is designed to work with machine learning datasets from several common websites, such as [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). Students can explore this website to find a dataset that fits their needs, then use the dataset in AI Lab to train their model. An account is required to download datasets - we recommend having a teacher create an account and manage downloading datasets for students.\n\nIn general, this project focuses on students' ability to plan and execute an AI app that addresses an issue they care about, from ideation to data collection to app creation. Completing this cycle is ultimately more important than having an accurate app, especially since students have previously completed the mini-project which focuses more on training an accurate model and since students can document the intended uses and limitations on a Model Card."

This tends to happen when using more than 6 features in a model.\n\nThere are two strategies you can use to help students fix this:\n\n**Strategy #1: Make New Elements.** Students can use design mode to drag out new elements to use in their app. They may also decide to move the elements to different screens to help make the app easier to use. After adding these new design mode elements, students will need to update their code to use the new elements as well. Students can refer to [Lesson 13](../11), especially level 1, as an example of how to update their code to fix this problem.\n\n**Strategy #2: Reposition Elements.** Even though the elements are off the screen, you can use Design Mode to manually select them and re-position them so they are on the screen. This involves changing the y-position property to 0 so it is on the screen, and then re-arranging the element like you would normally."
