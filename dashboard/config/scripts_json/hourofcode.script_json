Try putting tape on the floor to make it look like the bird’s maze. Model the commands yourself and then pick 1 or 2 student volunteers to model for the class.\r\n- Have students pair program by sitting 2 students at the same computer. Have the person controlling the mouse and keyboard first be a “1” and the other student who makes suggestions, points out errors, and asks questions be a “2.” Every 5 minutes, have the students switch roles.\r\n- Practice clicking and dragging blocks before attempting to solve any of the puzzles. Also, practice dragging blocks to the trash can.",
