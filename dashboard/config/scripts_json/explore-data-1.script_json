        "overview": "This lesson builds off of the concepts for bar charts and histograms that have already been introduced to students. Students will practice making conclusions from charts and learn to use the Data Visualizer in App Lab to create two different kinds of charts: a bar chart, and a histogram. This tool is designed to quickly connect students with real-world datasets and make it easy to create visualizations from data without learning how to navigate a more complex tool. They will also have access to several real-world datasets that they can use to create their charts.\n\n\n\nThe lesson begins with a quick prompt to review the reasons charts are useful for looking at data. Students then practice creating a bar chart in the Data Visualizer in App Lab. Then they learn how to make histograms for building charts in instances where bar charts may not be useful. Students then have a chance to explore different real-world datasets and see how making charts can help communicate information about a topic they care about.\n\n####Prerequisite Skills and Vocabulary\n\nThis lesson is intended to enrich or reinforce existing lessons on bar charts and histograms. It is not meant to introduce new core content to students. Students should come into this lesson with the following prior knowledge and skills:\n\n\n- Know how to read a bar chart, understanding what the values on the x and y axes represent\n- Know how to read a histogram, understanding what the range of values represent\n",
        "preparation": "- Students will need accounts on Code.org to engage with certain aspects of this lesson. If you’ve ever done an Hour of Code activity with Code.org, the steps to set up your class are similar. You can use the following resources to prepare for introducing students to the Code.org platform:\n  - [Creating a Class Section](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/115000488132-Creating-a-classroom-section)\n   - [Creating Accounts for Students](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/202114633-Creating-accounts-for-students-and-adding-them-to-your-section)\n  - [The Student Experience on Code.org](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/115001347791-The-student-experience-on-Code-org)\n\n- Try using the Data Visualizer yourself to make some of the charts students will create as part of completing the lesson.\n\n- If needed, reserve computers to use in class during this lesson.\n",

Each person has a set amount of time to share the chart they created. Once the timer is over, they find a new partner. This can be repeated several times.\n\n- Digital Bulletin Board: Create a shared digital space for students to paste their charts, then encourage students to leave comments on each other’s charts describing the piece of information they notice most about each chart.\n\n\n"
