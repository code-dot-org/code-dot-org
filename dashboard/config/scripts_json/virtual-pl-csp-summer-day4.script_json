Your team's diverse ideas will help make your app even better, because each partner can keep a lookout for bias. \r\n\r\nHere's an example: A team member puts in their app the phrase: \"All teenagers work after school to earn spending money\" because this is their experience - they work after school themselves. However, the other team member may not have an after school job, and because of this can point out the bias in that statement. \r\n\r\nCollaboration is key to catching bias in your work! \r\n\r\nHere's another example, this time in the design of an app. A team wants to make an app to encourage girls to sign up for a summer camp. One team member assumes that because this app is aimed at girls, the background should be pink. A girl on the team points out that she does not like pink, and using that color in the design may represent bias. \r\n\r\nAs you think about your topics and start designing your apps, remember to keep an eye out for bias and use your team mates to keep you accountable!",
