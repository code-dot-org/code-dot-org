Then in the activity, students return to baggies and sticky notes from the previous unit to build a concrete model of a list before seeing how lists are programmed in Javascript. Students are exposed to different ways of interacting with a list like accessing, removing, appending, and inserting elements. The wrap up concludes the lesson with a summary video and a journal vocabulary exercise. ",

Students use an Activity Guide to go through the high level steps they should use to develop their app but leaves it to them to decide how to write the code. At the end students submit their apps which can be assessed using a provided rubric.",

When students mentions specific lines of code actually scroll to that line and read through it together.\r\n\r\n**Save Modifications for the End:** This lesson can be tight on time.

One of the most common errors with lists, therefore, is trying to access indexes that are out of bounds, most notably `list.length`,\r\n* Syntax errors are common with lists, as the bracket notation is new. Encourage students to use the blocks to help if they need.\r\n* When using the patterns students may become overly reliant on simply copying and pasting without thinking through what the code from the patterns does. They may reference variables that don't exist in their program, for example, because it is in the example code of the pattern.\r\n\r\n"

The model is typically that a term or concept is introduced and modeled and then afterwards students are encouraged to try it out on their own. Trying it out typically means they are writing information on a sticky note and sharing it with another group before discussing the results with the whole class.\r\n\r\nSlides with animations have an icon in the bottom left corner to let you know you need to click to reveal more of the slide's content. \r\n\r\nTo help you more easily prepare the activity and keep track of your instructions, detailed instructions have been included as speaker notes in the presentation. Here are some tips to help you throughout the presentation.\r\n\r\n* There are opportunities throughout the presentation for students to actively engage. At these moments students should be making things with their manipulatives or using them to answer questions. Use these opportunities to check progress.\r\n* There is a fair amount of new vocabulary introduced but it is introduced gradually and with intentional repetition. Make a point of actively modeling the use of new terms.\r\n* The most important goal here is building a mental model. It is ok if students have some open questions that will get resolved over the subsequent conditional lessons.\r\n* Both you and students can use the \"Key Takeaways\" to check your understanding at the end."

Other examples of simulations are flight simulators which allows you to practice flying without damaging yourself or a real plane or a city building game where you can play with tweaking multiple values in the economy without real consequences.\n\nThese examples demonstrate the process of developing an abstract simulation where the specific details have been removed, or the functionality simplified. \n   \n   \tWhile simulations are a useful way to model the real-world, we also need to be constantly on the lookout for bias in the real-world elements that are actually included in the simulation.\n\nToday, we are going to look at a simple simulation.\n\nSimulations can be helpful to run when it would take a long time or it would be too impractical to do something physically. For example, what if we wanted to see the results of a coin flip that we flipped a million times? That would take a long time to perform ourselves, but a computer can run that simulation much quicker. Let's look at an app that does just that.",

Here are some tips to help you throughout the presentation.\n\n* There are opportunities throughout the presentation for students to actively engage. At these moments students should be making things with their manipulatives or using them to answer questions. Use these opportunities to check progress.\n* There is a fair amount of new vocabulary introduced but it is introduced gradually and with intentional repetition. Make a point of actively modeling the use of new terms.\n* The most important goal here is building a mental model. It is ok if students have some open questions that will get resolved over the subsequent conditional lessons.\n* Both you and students can use the \"Key Takeaways\" to check your understanding at the end.\n\n"

Make sure you and your partner have all the supplies you see on the screen. <br><br> **Note to Teacher:** If you are concerned about time or material management, the Traversal Machines can be prepared ahead of time. You only need one Traversal Machine per pair of students, and machines can be shared between classes. <br><br> There are three places to make cuts: <br><ul><li>The dotted line at the top of the sheet</li><li>The box with the list index</li><li>The box inside of the variable baggy</li></ul>  |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals2.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"} | **Do This:** On a scrap piece of paper or a sticky note, write down the list on the screen.  |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals3.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"} | **Prompt:** What if I want to know if a value is in a list?

To do this... let's use a for loop.  |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals5.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"} | **Do This:** Set up the Traversal Machine. <br><br> **Note:** Students use scissors make cuts as directed on the Traversal Machines.

Usually we assign it to 0. What else starts with 0? The index of a list! <br><br> **Note:** In Javascript, the index of a list starts at 0. You may want to remind students that on the AP Exam, pseudocode starts the index at 1.|\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals7.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"} | **Say:** This is the Boolean expression that is checked to see if the loop should continue to run. When working with a list, we want to access every element in the list,s o we are going to keep the loop going until we have hit list.length. <br><br> **Note:** You may want to remind students that list.length evaluates to the length of a list, which will be different than the last index number. For example, in a list of three, the length is 3 and the index numbers are 0, 1, 2 |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals8.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"} | **Do This:** replace list with the name of your list. In this case, we would replace it with temps. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/Screen-Shot-2020-11-25-at-9.24.37-AM_C2zpJ9H.png){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"} | **Say:** The counter variable i increases after each loop runs. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals9.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"} | **Say:** To access each element in the list, we are going to store the element in a variable inside the for loop. Let's try this out with your Traversal Machine. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> **Do This:** Set up a variable baggy and give it the name element. <br><br> **Note:** You may opt to not use variable baggies at all in this lesson and instead have students keep track of variables on a scrap piece of paper. In this case, the variable element is tracking the local variable that is inside of the for loop. With every round of the for loop, the variable will update. It's not necessary to build a baggy for the variable i - this will be represented on the Traversal Machine itself as a drawing of a baggy. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals10.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"} | **Do This:** Pull the index sheetu p to assign i to 0. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> **Say:** Notice how the variable in the baggy has changed. Each time the loop is executed, the variable i increases by one. <br><br> **Note:** For the following six slides, students will follow along with what's happening on the screen with their own Traversal Machines. Give students a few seconds to pull up the index sheet at each step. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals11.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"} | **Say:** Look at the list on the screen. Right now i=0. <br><br> **Do This:** Evaluate the statement in the for loop to see what value is stored by the variable element. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click through animation:** There are six steps to click through. <code>temps[0]</code> evaluates to 77 which is stored in the variable <code>element</code> |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals12.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"} | **Do This:** Now pull the index sheet up one spot. i now equals 1.

No - so we exit out of the loop. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals16.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"} | **Say:** Are you starting to see a pattern here? <br><br><ul><li>We are able to access each item in a list by using a for loop.</li><li>This is called traversal. We are traveling or traversing through a list one element at a time.</li></ul>  |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals17.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"} | **Say:** Let's look for a number in the temps list. It's easy for you to scan the list quickly with your own eyes, but for this exercise, let's pretend you are a computer and must use the Traversal Machine to look for the number. <br><br> **Do this:** <br><ul><li>Write down the code to the left on a sticky note and put it in your for loop.</li><li> Pull the index sheet up each time you go through the loop.</li><li>Run the loop until it is finished</li><li>Your \"console\" can be a scrap piece of paper.</li><li>When done, compare your console with another group.</li></ul>  |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals18.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"} | **Say:** Check your console. Does it look like what you see on the screen? The number 85 was found at index 1, the second number in the list. Notice that i currently has the value 4. This is because we stopped after four rounds. Element is currently storing 65, the last element that we accessed, at index 3. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals19.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"} | **Say:** Now I want to find the smallest number in a list. I am going to reduce the list to the smallest number. We are going to leave the baggies behind now. You can use a scrap piece of paper to store the global variable <code>var min = temps[0]</code> <br><br> **Do This:** <br><ul><li>Evaluate that statement to find the value stored in min.</li><li>Run the program</li><li>Update the variable min as needed</li></ul> |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals20.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"} | **Say:** The smallest number in the list is 65. Again, this is easy for you to quickly scan with your eyes when your list is short, but imagine if your list contained 1,000 or 1,000,000 elements? This is where a computer using a loop really shines. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals21.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"} | **Say:** Let's make it more challenging. <br><br> **Do This:** <br><ul><li>With your partner, update the code inside the for loop to now find the largest number (max)</li><li>One partner creates a new list of 8 random numbers and keeps them hidden.</li><li>The other partner runs the Traversal Machine to find the largest number in the list by asking for each number one at a time. </li><li>Before beginning: <br><ul><li>store the global variable on a scrap piece of paper: <code>var max = temps[0];</code><li><li>Evaluate that statement to find the value stored in max. Ask your partner what is stored at \"temps index 0\"</li></ul><li>Run the for loop.</li><li>Check your answer at the end with your partner!</li></ul><br><br> **Note:** Read the example at the bottom of the screen out loud so students understand how they should interact while using the Traversal Machine. Allow students five or so minutes to fully complete the task on this slide. Here's a sample of what their updated code might look like: <br><br><code>if(element>max)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{max = element;<br>}</code>|\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals22_7ovsk3m.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"} | **Say:** Now I have a list of animals from which I want to filter some elements and store them in another list. <br><br> **Note:** Guide the students through the setup listed on the screen. <br><br> **Do This:** <br><ul><li>One partner creates a list of eight random animals, and stores it in the list animals on a scrap of paper. Keep this list hidden.</li><li>The other partner uses a separate scrap of paper to track a new list called animalsListA</li><li>Change the name of the list in the for loop of the Traversal Machine to animals.</li><li>Copy the code to the right on to a sticky note and place it in the for loop of the Traversal Machine.</li></ul>  |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals23.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"} | **Do This:** <br><ul><li>Run the code</li><li>Keep track of your console</li><li>When finished, trade your animal list with another group, run the code, and compare your console outputs</li></ul><br><br> **Note:** Expect this activity to take around 5 minutes.

In particular, students may not receive a grade based on performance on topic questions nor can they be used for teacher evaluation. Beyond these requirements, however, they are primarily intended to formatively assess student progress and learning as they prepare for the end of course exam.\r\n\r\nWithin our own course we recommend that you use them in a variety of ways:\r\n\r\n* Throughout the unit assign topic questions to students related to the topics students are learning about that day or that week\r\n* Prior to the unit assessment assign topic questions to help students practice and prepare for the summative assessment\r\n* After the unit assessment use these topic questions to help students track their progress towards preparation for the AP assessment\r\n\r\n![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/topics5.png)\r\n\r\nClick for more info: [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dqYF5u0AULjw049gaCwAP34ZSe0VuEWbAjWoH1-YMW0/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n"
