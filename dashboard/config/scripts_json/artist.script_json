Check your technology and decide if you need to troubleshoot anything in advance of your Hour of Code.\n\n### One Day Before Your Hour of Code\n\n- Print one or more of the [Exit Ticket examples](https://docs.google.com/a/code.org/document/d/1ylIlO7Pppk6W3Jt58VHS5mjvnshg9URvj3iCU0Ok6qY/edit?usp=sharing) at the end of this lesson plan, or create your own. \n- Each student who completes the activity should receive a [certificate](https://studio.code.org/certificates/batch). Print one for each student in advance to make this easier at the end of your Hour of Code.\n\n \n - Play through the puzzles to find any potential problem areas for your class.\n - (Optional) Obtain protractors for your class to visualize the angles they must use to complete the puzzles.\n - Print one **Turns & Angles - Student Handout** for each student.",

Students work their way through a series of puzzles that teach them to code, and educators have access to engaging lesson plans that help make the learning coming alive. Code.org offers free professional development for these courses, online or in-person.\n- **Visit [You can Teach Computer Science](https://code.org/teach)** for more course suggestions.\n- **Invite a computer science expert to talk to your class about his or her work**. Don’t know any local computer scientists? Reach out to a volunteer on our [volunteer map](https://code.org/volunteer/local)\n\n\nUse the following activity to enhance student learning. It can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.\n\n**The Copy Machine**\n\n- Give students two pieces of paper\n- On one sheet draw a simple image, using straight lines only.\n- On the second sheet draw instructions for recreating that image commands to move straight and turn at various angles.\n- Trade instruction sheets and attempt to recreate the image using only the provided instructions."
