It begins with a discussion on the impact of past technological innovations on society. Students then explore the concept of generative AI through the lens of someone familiar only with its hype, aiming to foster understanding and responsible engagement with AI technology. A key part of the lesson is the introduction of the Input, Storage, Processing, Output (ISPO) framework, essential for understanding generative AI's workings. The lesson concludes with students receiving a graphic organizer for the unit and sharing their anticipations about learning more on generative AI.",

However, not all words (like this one) are represented in that organizer. If you have your own system for tracking vocabulary that you've used in previous units, consider applying it here as well so students have a consistent experience.\n\nIf you don't have a system for managing vocabulary, you might consider the following strategies:\n- Create a Word Wall or posters for these vocabulary terms and hang them up in your classroom as they are introduced throughout the unit. \n- Provide a vocabulary handout that is updated after lessons and lives near desks or computers so students can reference as needed."
