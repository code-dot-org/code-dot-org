        "description": "### Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy\n\n* **Independent Creation and The Hackathon Project:** Much like the project in Unit 4, the \"Hackathon\" project in this unit is designed as an opportunity for students to creatively and independently build something with their programming skills. While students are asked to include some technical requirements in their program to ensure they demonstrate mastery of new programming concepts, they have free rein to choose the goals, design, and implementation of their project. To avoid asking students to complete a major programming project right before the Create PT, this hackathon is the most \"Create-PT-like\" project of the course. It is the best chance for students to practice skills like budgeting time or scoping an open-ended project. In many classrooms, if you maintain the recommended pacing of the course, this project serves as an excellent end to the first semester.\n\n* **Growing Comfort with EIPM:** By Unit 5, students (and teachers!) should be developing greater comfort with the flow of EIPM lessons. Students may begin to anticipate that sequences build towards an independent Make lesson or look forward to stepping away from computers to Explore. A nice feature of EIPM is that you will find strategies and modifications to each lesson type that work best for your students. Keep an eye out for how you and your students are developing comfort with EIPM and note strategies that help meet your classroom's needs.\n\n* **Programming with Real-world Data:** The Data Library is a new feature in App Lab for the 2020-21 school year and was designed to let students program with data from the real world. This tool aims to motivate students to build new kinds of data-powered apps that they find personally interesting. This tool also facilitates programming with lists of information since students will need to manipulate lists of data to incorporate the different data sources. Encourage students to use datasets they find personally relevant as they draw on their creative ideas for bringing data to life.\n\n\n\n### Major Assessment and Projects\n\nThe unit project asks students to spend five days as part of a \"Hackathon\" project that they have nearly complete independence to scope and design. Students must choose one dataset from the Data Library in AppLab to be a component of their project to demonstrate what they have learned about lists and list processing; otherwise, scoping the project is completely up to them. Students submit their app, project guide, and written responses to reflection questions about how the app is designed and the development process they used to make it. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n\n### AP Connections\n\nThis unit and unit project helps build towards the enduring understandings listed below. For a detailed mapping of units to Learning Objectives and EKs, please see the \"Standards\" page for this unit.\n\n* CRD-2: Developers create and innovate using an iterative design process that is user-focused, incorporating implementation/feedback cycles, which leaves ample room for experimentation and risk-taking.\n* AAP-1: To find specific solutions to generalizable problems, programmers represent and organize data in multiple ways.\n* AAP-2: The way statements are sequenced and combined in a program determines the computed result. Programs incorporate iteration and selection constructs to represent repetition and make decisions to handle varied input values.\n* AAP-3: Programmers break down problems into smaller and more manageable pieces. By creating procedures and leveraging parameters, programmers generalize processes that they can reuse. Procedures allow programmers to draw upon existing code that has already been tested, allowing them to write programs more quickly and more confidently.\n\nThis unit includes content from the following topics from the AP CS Principles Framework. For more detailed information on topic coverage in the course review [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RniAGymLBBpIpDaNNR5Ea8CgiiUKv0tMvaDixSj6m_Q/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n* 3.2 Data Abstraction\n* 3.4 Strings\n* 3.8 Iteration\n* 3.10 Lists\n* 3.16 Simulations\n\nThe College Board has supplied formative Create PT questions to help prepare students to complete the Create Task. We recommend that students complete the following prompts with the unit project. More information can be found in Code.org CS Principles Topic Coverage.\n\n* 3.b.i\n* 3.b.ii\n* 3.b.iii\n* 3.b.iv\n* 3.b.v"

At the end students submit their apps which can be assessed using a provided rubric.",

Make sure they share with another group.|\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-20-21-U5-Lists-Explore-Slide-5.svg)| **Say:** Your list is made up of elements. Each element has its own index. Indexes are just numbers that count up from zero. The length of the list is how many elements it contains. This list has 3 elements and indexes from 0 to 2.|\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-20-21-U5-Lists-Explore-Slide-6.jpg)| **Say:** Notice that all the bags can folded up and be placed inside the big variable baggie. Sometimes we want to think about the whole list, sometimes we want to think about individual elements |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-20-21-U5-Lists-Explore-Slide-7.svg)| **Say:** We create a list with this command. It creates a new list and assigns it to a variable. The square brackets indicate we’re making a list. Each value is separated by commas. <br><br> **Do This:** Have students write the command to make their own list and the list of partner group. By sharing their answers with another group they can check that they’re following along.|\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-20-21-U5-Lists-Explore-Slide-8.svg) | **Say:** If we want to access the values in our list we use the square brackets next to the name of our list. <br><br> **Do This:** Have students discuss with other groups. They should see the answers are “nachos” and “soup” |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-20-21-U5-Lists-Explore-Slide-9.svg) | **Say:** We can use list accesses inside of expressions, just like variables. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> **Say:** This first expression evaluates to 23 because myNumbers[1] contains 20. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> **Say:** This second expression evaluates to 35 because myNumbers[0] and myNumbers[2] contain 25 and 10. <br><br> **Do This:** Have students write three expressions using their own lists. Then have them trade with another group to practice evaluating. Circulate the room to make sure students are following the directions correctly. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-20-21-U5-Lists-Explore-Slide-10.svg) | **Say:** We can assign the index of a list just like a variable. <Br><br> **Do This:** Have students discuss what the list will contain after line 02 runs. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> **Say:** This code will assign a new value at index 2 of the list. |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-20-21-U5-Lists-Explore-Slide-11.svg) |**Do This:** Circulate the room while students run this program <br><br>![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br>**Discuss:** Discuss quickly with the class why the program ends with the list shown.|\n|![](https://images.code.org/837c1d6a1d389a300e74cb5b1c4951e3-image-1641233752930.12.31 AM.png)| **Do This:** Circulate the room while students run this program <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br>**Discuss:** Discuss quickly with the class why the program ends with the list shown. <br><br> **Note:** Line 02 is tricky. You need to first evaluate myStuff[0] which is “dog”  to determine the value being assigned. Then evaluate myStuff[2], which is 3. At this point, the command reads myStuff[3] = “dog”. Now it is just a simple assignment. |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-20-21-U5-Lists-Explore-Slide-13.svg)| **Say:** Now let’s learn about three different commands that can change your list. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-20-21-U5-Lists-Explore-Slide-14.svg) | **Say:** The removeItem command will remove an item from a list. The item at the index given is removed, items to the right are shifted over, and the last index is removed.<br><br>**Do This:** Have students discuss what the list will show after this command.<br><br>![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br>**Discuss:** Discuss with the class any questions.|\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-20-21-U5-Lists-Explore-Slide-15.svg)| **Say:** The appendITem command will add an item to a list. A new index is added to the end of the list and the new item is place in it.<br><br>**Do This:** Have students discuss what the list will show after this command.<br><br>![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br>**Discuss:** Discuss with the class any questions.|\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-20-21-U5-Lists-Explore-Slide-16.svg)| **Say:** The insertItem command will add an item to the middle of a list. The item is placed in the index given. Then every item is moved over one space to make room. A new index is aded to the end of the list to make room.<br><br>**Do This:** Have students discuss what the list will show after this command.<br><br>![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br>**Discuss:** Discuss with the class any questions.|\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-20-21-U5-Lists-Explore-Slide-17.svg)|**Do This:** Have students run this program. Circulate the room to support them with any questions.<br><br>![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br>**Discuss:** Discuss with the class any questions.|\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-20-21-U5-Lists-Explore-Slide-18.svg)|**Do This:** Have students run this program.

Students have a number of supports at their fingertips, so a big part of your role is helping build their independence in using those resources.\n\n**Common Errors:** The following are common errors students may encounter in this lesson:\n\n* The last index in a list is at `list.length-1` because the first index is 0. One of the most common errors with lists, therefore, is trying to access indexes that are out of bounds, most notably `list.length`,\n* Syntax errors are common with lists, as the bracket notation is new. Encourage students to use the blocks to help if they need.\n* When using the patterns students may become overly reliant on simply copying and pasting without thinking through what the code from the patterns does. They may reference variables that don't exist in their program, for example, because it is in the example code of the pattern.\n\n"

Here are some tips to help you throughout the presentation.\n\n* There are opportunities throughout the presentation for students to actively engage. At these moments students should be making things with their manipulatives or using them to answer questions. Use these opportunities to check progress.\n* There is a fair amount of new vocabulary introduced but it is introduced gradually and with intentional repetition. Make a point of actively modeling the use of new terms.\n* The most important goal here is building a mental model. It is ok if students have some open questions that will get resolved over the subsequent conditional lessons.\n* Both you and students can use the \"Key Takeaways\" to check your understanding at the end."

You will move a robot around a game board following commands. Here's the first one: [`moveForward()`(#4dd0e1)](/docs/applab/moveForward/). <br><br> **Do This:** Use this command to write a program to move the robot to the purple box. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click through animation to reveal the answer.** |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSPU5_Lists_Loops_Traversals_Loops2.png) | **Say:** This code is repetitive. How can we simplify it? By using a While Loop. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSPU5_Lists_Loops_Traversals_Loops3.png) | **Say:** Here's how a While Loop works. While something is true, the code in the while loop runs, over and over until that thing is no longer true. Let's try it together! |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSPU5_Lists_Loops_Traversals_Loops4.png) | **Say:** Let's run this program together. Set up your board with the robot in the same place as the robot on the screen. We are going to run each step of the loop together. First you will try it on your board, and then we will look at the answers on the screen. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSPU5_Lists_Loops_Traversals_Loops5.png) | **Say:** Read the code with your partner and complete the first round of the loop. You may want a sticky note or a scrap piece of paper out to keep track of the value in the variable. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click through to view the answer after students have had a chance to follow the code on their own board.

Other examples of simulations are flight simulators which allows you to practice flying without damaging yourself or a real plane or a city building game where you can play with tweaking multiple values in the economy without real consequences.\n\nThese examples demonstrate the process of developing an abstract simulation where the specific details have been removed, or the functionality simplified. \n   \nWhile simulations are a useful way to model the real-world, we also need to be constantly on the lookout for bias in the real-world elements that are actually included in the simulation.\n\nToday, we are going to look at a simple simulation.\n\nSimulations can be helpful to run when it would take a long time or it would be too impractical to do something physically. For example, what if we wanted to see the results of a coin flip that we flipped a million times? That would take a long time to perform ourselves, but a computer can run that simulation much quicker. Let's look at an app that does just that.",

Here are some tips to help you throughout the presentation.\n\n* There are opportunities throughout the presentation for students to actively engage. At these moments students should be making things with their manipulatives or using them to answer questions. Use these opportunities to check progress.\n* There is a fair amount of new vocabulary introduced but it is introduced gradually and with intentional repetition. Make a point of actively modeling the use of new terms.\n* The most important goal here is building a mental model. It is ok if students have some open questions that will get resolved over the subsequent conditional lessons.\n* Both you and students can use the \"Key Takeaways\" to check your understanding at the end.\n\n"

Make sure you and your partner have all the supplies you see on the screen. <br><br> **Note to Teacher:** If you are concerned about time or material management, the Traversal Machines can be prepared ahead of time. You only need one Traversal Machine per pair of students, and machines can be shared between classes. <br><br> There are three places to make cuts: <br><ul><li>The dotted line at the top of the sheet</li><li>The box with the list index</li><li>The box inside of the variable baggy</li></ul>  |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals2.svg) | **Do This:** On a scrap piece of paper or a sticky note, write down the list on the screen.  |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals3.svg) | **Prompt:** What if I want to know if a value is in a list? With a partner, discuss the method you would use to look for an item in a list. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation to reveal suggested answer**|\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals4.svg) | **Say:** Computers are really good at checking things one by one. To do this... let's use a for loop.  |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals5.svg) | **Do This:** Set up the Traversal Machine. <br><br> **Note:** Students use scissors make cuts as directed on the Traversal Machines. As noted before, this can all be done before class to save time. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals6.svg) | **Do This:** Direct students attention to their Traversal Machines as you describe the parts. <br><br> **Say:** This is where we assign the starting value to the counter variable i. Usually we assign it to 0. What else starts with 0? The index of a list! <br><br> **Note:** In Javascript, the index of a list starts at 0. You may want to remind students that on the AP Exam, pseudocode starts the index at 1.|\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals7.svg) | **Say:** This is the Boolean expression that is checked to see if the loop should continue to run. When working with a list, we want to access every element in the list,s o we are going to keep the loop going until we have hit list.length. <br><br> **Note:** You may want to remind students that list.length evaluates to the length of a list, which will be different than the last index number. For example, in a list of three, the length is 3 and the index numbers are 0, 1, 2 |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals8.svg) | **Do This:** replace list with the name of your list. In this case, we would replace it with temps. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/Screen-Shot-2020-11-25-at-9.24.37-AM_C2zpJ9H.png) | **Say:** The counter variable i increases after each loop runs. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals9.svg) | **Say:** To access each element in the list, we are going to store the element in a variable inside the for loop. Let's try this out with your Traversal Machine. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> **Do This:** Set up a variable baggy and give it the name element. <br><br> **Note:** You may opt to not use variable baggies at all in this lesson and instead have students keep track of variables on a scrap piece of paper. In this case, the variable element is tracking the local variable that is inside of the for loop. With every round of the for loop, the variable will update. It's not necessary to build a baggy for the variable i - this will be represented on the Traversal Machine itself as a drawing of a baggy. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals10.svg) | **Do This:** Pull the index sheetu p to assign i to 0. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> **Say:** Notice how the variable in the baggy has changed. Each time the loop is executed, the variable i increases by one. <br><br> **Note:** For the following six slides, students will follow along with what's happening on the screen with their own Traversal Machines. Give students a few seconds to pull up the index sheet at each step. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals11.svg) | **Say:** Look at the list on the screen. Right now i=0. <br><br> **Do This:** Evaluate the statement in the for loop to see what value is stored by the variable element. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click through animation:** There are six steps to click through. <code>temps[0]</code> evaluates to 77 which is stored in the variable <code>element</code> |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals12.svg) | **Do This:** Now pull the index sheet up one spot. i now equals 1. Evaluate the statement inside the for loop. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click through animation:** There are seven steps to click through. <code>temps[1]</code> evaluates to 85 which is stored in the variable <code>element</code>  |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals13.svg) | **Do This:** Pull the index sheet up again. i now equals 2. Evaluate the statement inside the for loop. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click through animation:** There are seven steps to click through. <code>temps[2]</code> evaluates to 89 which is stored in the variable <code>element</code>  |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals14.svg) | **Do This:** Pull the index sheet up again. i now equals 3. Evaluate the statement inside the for loop. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click through animation:** There are seven steps to click through. <code>temps[3]</code> evaluates to 65 which is stored in the variable <code>element</code> |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals15.svg) | **Do This:** Now pull up the index sheet one last time. i now equals 4. <br><br> **Prompt:** What happens next? <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click through animation** There are three steps to click through. <br><br> **Say:** Is 4 less than 4 (the length of the list)? No - so we exit out of the loop. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals16.svg) | **Say:** Are you starting to see a pattern here? <br><br><ul><li>We are able to access each item in a list by using a for loop.</li><li>This is called traversal. We are traveling or traversing through a list one element at a time.</li></ul>  |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals17.svg) | **Say:** Let's look for a number in the temps list. It's easy for you to scan the list quickly with your own eyes, but for this exercise, let's pretend you are a computer and must use the Traversal Machine to look for the number. <br><br> **Do this:** <br><ul><li>Write down the code to the left on a sticky note and put it in your for loop.</li><li> Pull the index sheet up each time you go through the loop.</li><li>Run the loop until it is finished</li><li>Your \"console\" can be a scrap piece of paper.</li><li>When done, compare your console with another group.</li></ul>  |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals18.svg) | **Say:** Check your console. Does it look like what you see on the screen? The number 85 was found at index 1, the second number in the list. Notice that i currently has the value 4. This is because we stopped after four rounds. Element is currently storing 65, the last element that we accessed, at index 3. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals19.svg) | **Say:** Now I want to find the smallest number in a list. I am going to reduce the list to the smallest number. We are going to leave the baggies behind now. You can use a scrap piece of paper to store the global variable <code>var min = temps[0]</code> <br><br> **Do This:** <br><ul><li>Evaluate that statement to find the value stored in min.</li><li>Run the program</li><li>Update the variable min as needed</li></ul> |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals20.svg) | **Say:** The smallest number in the list is 65. Again, this is easy for you to quickly scan with your eyes when your list is short, but imagine if your list contained 1,000 or 1,000,000 elements? This is where a computer using a loop really shines. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals21.svg) | **Say:** Let's make it more challenging. <br><br> **Do This:** <br><ul><li>With your partner, update the code inside the for loop to now find the largest number (max)</li><li>One partner creates a new list of 8 random numbers and keeps them hidden.</li><li>The other partner runs the Traversal Machine to find the largest number in the list by asking for each number one at a time. </li><li>Before beginning: <br><ul><li>store the global variable on a scrap piece of paper: <code>var max = temps[0];</code><li><li>Evaluate that statement to find the value stored in max. Ask your partner what is stored at \"temps index 0\"</li></ul><li>Run the for loop.</li><li>Check your answer at the end with your partner!</li></ul><br><br> **Note:** Read the example at the bottom of the screen out loud so students understand how they should interact while using the Traversal Machine. Allow students five or so minutes to fully complete the task on this slide. Here's a sample of what their updated code might look like: <br><br><code>if(element>max)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{max = element;<br>}</code>|\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals22_7ovsk3m.svg) | **Say:** Now I have a list of animals from which I want to filter some elements and store them in another list. <br><br> **Note:** Guide the students through the setup listed on the screen. <br><br> **Do This:** <br><ul><li>One partner creates a list of eight random animals, and stores it in the list animals on a scrap of paper. Keep this list hidden.</li><li>The other partner uses a separate scrap of paper to track a new list called animalsListA</li><li>Change the name of the list in the for loop of the Traversal Machine to animals.</li><li>Copy the code to the right on to a sticky note and place it in the for loop of the Traversal Machine.</li></ul>  |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals23.svg) | **Do This:** <br><ul><li>Run the code</li><li>Keep track of your console</li><li>When finished, trade your animal list with another group, run the code, and compare your console outputs</li></ul><br><br> **Note:** Expect this activity to take around 5 minutes. When students have finished, move on to the Takeaways in the Wrap Up |"

Then as a class address any confusion over how the app works. \n\n* **The goal:** The goal of this investigation is to give students the opportunity to see lists traversed for different reasons and with different outcomes.   Students should look at the code for their assigned function and make sense of what the function does overall and how it does it.  \n* **What to look for:** It may be helpful to re-watch the [video](https://youtu.be/RQ6GJt9f2vg) in the U5L10 - Traversals Explore lesson starting at 3:07 to hear how the speaker describes a section of code that processes a list for a specific purpose.  Listening to that explanation will help give you an idea of what student explanations of their functions should sound like.  \n    \n    For example, when explaining the average function in this investigation, students should describe what the function does.  In this case, the function calculates the average of the values stored in the `mileTimes` list and stores that value in the `avg` variable. In addition to describing what the function does, students should describe how the function works.  This will involve more detail.  \n  * Students should be able to describe that the function contains a local variable of `total` which is initialized at 0.  \n  * Then the function uses a for loop to traverse through the `mileTimes` list.  In the loop, each value inside `mileTimes` list is accessed and added to the current value stored inside the total variable.  \n  * When the loop reaches the end of the list, the loop ends and the total variable contains the sum of all the `mileTimes`.  In the last line of the function, the value stored in `avg` is updated by dividing the value stored in `total` by the total number of elements in the `mileTimes` list.  \n\n    \n \nWhen you bring the class together to talk about how the app works, you should talk both about what the functions do as well as how they work.  There likely is not time to go over all four functions, but discussing one or two of them will ensure the full class has an opportunity to hear how their peers describe code.",

It is not about getting the “right answer” as much as it is about building skills in your students to read, test, and make sense of code that they haven’t seen before.

From that perspective, we also think it's appropriate to make choices about our content & curriculum that best suits your classroom. With that said, the Spotify dataset updates automatically every day according to the latest trends - we hope it provides a real-world social connection for students to engage with datasets, but also understand that we can't control the songs that make it to the top 200 and don't have the bandwidth to filter it on our end. If the songs for a particular day are not appropriate for your students, it may be a good idea to skip that dataset.\n"

Help guide students particularly to how the lists are filled. Students should see a `listSetup` function.  This function calls the `filter` function.  `filter` is where the lists are being filled.  Use the questions listed in CodeStudio to help students make sense of this code. In particular, spend a little extra time discussing the question “How are these lists filled?”. This is an opportunity to go through the `filter` function line by line to understand how the function works.",

We want to sort out the dogs so that when the user picks a size from the dropdown, only dogs of that size show up in the display. \n\nTo do this, we traverse using a filter pattern. Using a loop to go through each item in the `dogHeights` list, if a dog's height matches up to the requirements, we pull the dog's image and name from those original lists (all the indexes will match) and put those in the new filtered lists. \n\nOnce this is done, we have filtered lists that we can pull from to display a random dog's name and image.\n"
