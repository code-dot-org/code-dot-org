Use a poem that none of the students have compressed yet.\r\n* For each poem, have the group(s) who did it figure out the best in the class, and record it on the board or somewhere that people can see.\r\n    * Have a class goal of getting the compression percentages for the four poems as high as possible.\r\n    * The groups with the best compression percentages may be asked to share their strategy with the class.\r\n\r\nStudents may be reluctant to share if they feel they don’t have the best results, but students should see others’ work and offer advice and strategies.\r\n"
