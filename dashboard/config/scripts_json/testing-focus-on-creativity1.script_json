Students work in groups to design aluminum foil boats that will support as many pennies as possible.

The structure of the activity foreshadows different steps of the problem-solving process that students will be introduced to in more detail in the following lesson.

The lesson begins by anchoring the formal problem-solving process in some real-life experiences they already have solving problems by asking students to brainstorm all the different types of problems that they encounter in everyday life. Students are then shown the four steps of the problem-solving process and work together to relate these abstract steps to their actual experiences solving problems. First students relate these steps to the problem activities from the previous lesson, then a problem they are good at solving, then a problem they want to improve at solving. At the end of the lesson, the class collects a list of generally useful strategies for each step of the process to put on posters that will be used throughout the unit and year.\n\n**Question of the Day:** What are some common steps we can use to solve many different types of problems?\n",

Students should take time working in their groups to think of specific things that they did that follow each step of the process. The goal of this discussion is to make the abstract steps more concrete and accessible to students by relating them to a shared activity. The second question gives students a chance to expand their understanding of the process to a different problem, seeing how the different steps may look in different domains. The goal of this discussion is to make sure students have a general enough understanding of the process that they can apply it to a wider variety of problems since the process will be used throughout the course in various domains.\n",

If you take it at face value, your job is to randomly guess and check where to put individual people until you find a solution. It is much easier if you define the problem as place groups of friends instead. Make groups of 2 or 3 you know need to be together and then figure out which groups can't be at the same table. \r\n\r\nThis isn't the only approach to the problem, and you shouldn't rush to introduce it as such. Rather, encourage students to discuss with one another what they know needs to be true at the end and whether different approaches might help.\r\n\r\n**Draw Pictures:** Students will likely do better if they draw pictures. You may wish for students to use a journal or scratch paper as a place to brainstorm ideas.\r\n\r\n**Extending the Problem:** If one group finishes far before others you could give them a blank sheet of paper and ask them to solve the problem again but with a new condition of your choosing (e.g. pick two people sitting at the same table in their solution and ask whether they can solve the problem now that those two people are also in a fight.)\r\n"

Be ready to report out on the following questions\n\n* For each step in the problem-solving process, what is its purpose? Why is it included?\n* Are there any kinds of problems that the problem-solving process is particularly helpful at solving?\n\n**Discuss:** After tables have discussed their responses for several minutes invite the whole class to share their rationale for including each step in the process. Once each step has been discussed, move on to the second question. This question may have many responses and you should allow students to share their thoughts and experiences. If it doesn't arise naturally as you leave the conversation offer some or all of the ideas mentioned in the discussion goals.\n\n**Discussion Goal:** Students have practiced using the problem-solving process on a number of different problems. Help them synthesize the notes they have been keeping to better understand the role of each step and the value of the problem-solving process in general. A sample set of conclusions is below but you should allow students to share their own insights before offering your own.\n\n* **Define:** without defining a problem you might solve the wrong problem, not know where to start, or not know when you're finished\n\n* **Prepare:** Even well-defined problems usually have many possible approaches. Make each try more likely to succeed by first examining your options and anticipating challenges\n\n* **Try:** Without trying you'll never get anywhere. It's important to be persistent and patient so long as your plan still may work\n\n* **Reflect:** You'll likely not solve the problem the first time or there will be a better way to solve it. Learn from your past attempts and get ready to start the process again.\n\n* **The Problem Solving Process:** While you may notice you're using it even for small and trivial problems, this process is incredibly useful for large, complex, poorly-defined, or open-ended problems.
