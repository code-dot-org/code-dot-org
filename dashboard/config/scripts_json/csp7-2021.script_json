Here is a short list\r\n\r\n* Testing: Before sharing a library it is critical to make sure your functions actually work as intended. The best way to do this is to write tests that try out different cases of your program. By doing this like testing positive and negative numbers, or testing out edge cases, it's possible to assure yourself that your code works as you expect.\r\n* Debugging: Closely related to the point above, debugging libraries can be tricky once the program is shared with another student. While students can test functions that were shared with them, it will be up to the original author of the code to make the changes and ensure their library is bug free.\r\n* Abstraction: Libraries allow you to make blocks that are \"higher level\" than other blocks in the toolbox. The result is that the actual programs you write either will be shorter, since library code does the heavy lifting, or more complex, because library code allows you to focus on bigger problems. In either case, libraries help you focus on the high level problem you're solving rather than focus on the low level details, and this is an example of abstraction in programming.",

Students need to identify common situations or problems that they and other programmers may encounter, and help build commands to address that problem.\r\n\r\nThis project also caps off a unit that is all about abstraction. On one level students are thinking about procedural abstraction, and simply learning how to design functions. On another level, however, they're learning to think abstractly. They're not merely designing a function, but they're thinking about the entire process of how programs are developed and common problems or situations that arise.

Hold off on distributing the Activity Guide until later in the activity. |\r\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-7_-Parameters,-Returns,-and-Libraries2.svg) | **Say:** Let's pretend that I want to make a cake. I need to decide how many tiers the cake will have, and what flavor the cake will be. I've decided to make a 3 tiered cake.<br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** |\r\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-7_-Parameters,-Returns,-and-Libraries3.svg)| **Say:** If I flip over the envelope, and open it up there's a recipe inside. This recipe is going to tell me how to make the cake I've specified. |\r\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-7_-Parameters,-Returns,-and-Libraries4.svg)| **Say:** To do this, I'm going to replace `tiers` with `3` and `flavor` with `lemon`, every time those words show up in the recipe. But notice - this recipe is pretty general. I could use it to make lots of different types and sizes of cake. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> **Do This:** Read through the recipe as a class. Make sure everyone understands how it works before moving on. |\r\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-7_-Parameters,-Returns,-and-Libraries5.svg)| **Say:** Ok, let's make our cake. Remember, each time I come across `tiers` or `flavor`, I'm going to replace that word with the appropriate value. Once I'm done, I will have baked a 3 layer lemon cake! <br><br>![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation:** There are several steps to click through here. Take it slow so students can see each part. |\r\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-7_-Parameters,-Returns,-and-Libraries6.svg)| **Say:** This is a function! It should look familiar, but it has a few extra parts. This function has parameters. Parameters are used as plaeholders for values that will be passed through the function. <br><br>![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> **Say:** Those values passed to the parameter are called arguments. <br><br>![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** |\r\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-7_-Parameters,-Returns,-and-Libraries7.svg)| **Say:** Let's think through how changing the arguments affects the output. Now I want a four layer chocolate cake. With a partner, discuss what my arguments will look like. <br><br>![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> **Say:** I pass through the arguments `4` and `chocolate` to the parameters `tiers` and `flavor`. Then my function is ready. What will my cake look like? <br><br>![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** |\r\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-7_-Parameters,-Returns,-and-Libraries8.svg)|**Do This:** Distribute Activity Guides and direct students to Challenge #1. Students will create their own function envelopes and write a simple function that uses parameters which can be used to draw a house. When students are finished building their function envelopes, a partner tests out the code and draws the house on a spare sticky note. |\r\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-7_-Parameters,-Returns,-and-Libraries9.svg)| **Say:** Here's another function. This function is used to calculate the total cost of making a cake. Take note again of the arguments and parameters. <br><br>![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation**   |\r\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-7_-Parameters,-Returns,-and-Libraries10.svg)| **Say:** Let's open the envelope and check out how this function works. |\r\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-7_-Parameters,-Returns,-and-Libraries11.svg)| **Say:** There are a few new things here. First, we've created two local variables. Remember, the local variables are contained within the function and can't be updated or accessed outside of the function. We learned about this when we discussed variable scope. <br><br>![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> In this function, a decision (in this case, how much to charge per flavor) is made based on the argument passed through the parameter. <br><br>![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> Finally, the total is returned, but returned where? What does that mean? <br><br>![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation**  |\r\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-7_-Parameters,-Returns,-and-Libraries12.svg)| **Say:** Before we talk more about that return, let's calculate the total cost of our original cake. <br><br> **Do This:** With a partner, determine what `flavorCost` and `total` equal after the function is run. <br><br>![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** |\r\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-7_-Parameters,-Returns,-and-Libraries13.svg)| **Say:** Now let's think about the return. If the program hits a return at any point in running a function, it will stop and a value will be \"returned\". Where is it returned? To the place in the program where the function was called.  |\r\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-7_-Parameters,-Return,-and-Libraries20.svg)| **Say:** So to get back to our example, the value 12 is returned, but where is it returned to? Where is it stored? <br><br> **Do This:** Take a moment to brainstorm with a partner. |\r\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-7_-Parameters,-Returns,-and-Libraries15.svg)| **Say:** Let's return to variable baggies! A function return value can be stored in a variable. Notice how the envelope is placed inside of a baggie. That means that the function would be evalued and whatever is returned would be stored in the variable `cakeCalculator`. <br><br>![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** |\r\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-7_-Parameters,-Returns,-and-Libraries16.svg)| **Say:** Here's how this looks in JavaScript. It's ok if it's a little confusing. You'll get to play with this in Code Studio in the next lesson. For now, notice how the statement is set up. A variable is set up with the name `cakeCalculator`. This gets the value that is returned from the function `cakeCost` which has two arguments `3` and `lemon` passed through the parameters. After the function is evaluated, `cakeCalculator` now stores the value 12. |\r\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-7_-Parameters,-Returns,-and-Libraries17.svg)| **Say:** We can also print to the console like so. <br><br> **Do This: Read through as a class. |\r\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-7_-Parameters,-Returns,-and-Libraries18.svg)| **Do This:** Direct students to complete Challenge #2 in their Activity Guides. Students create a new envelope function which calculates the cost of the house from Challenge #1. After students are finished, they share the envelopes with a partner who tests the code. |",

Naming functions helps students write programs that read more like descriptions of what they do, and they also help students reuse code.\n\nThis quick discussion sets up many of these realizations. Students will not leave this lesson able to \"do more\" than previously. Instead they'll be able to write programs that are cleaner, better organized, and better able to be used elsewhere. Long term, writing programs like this will actually help students write more complex code, but because they as programmers will better be able to understand their programs and reuse the code they write. This quick discussion does not need to cover all of those points and should just be a reminder of things they've already seen.

Today they're going to be taking on \"blank functions\" rather than \"blank screens\". This is because with parameters and return values you can chunk out your programs into pieces that have well-defined behavior. Remind students that this is known as procedural abstraction.

Or maybe you've got a collection of functions in one program that you want to use in another program. Today we are going to explore the answer to this question: How can we easily share functions between programs?|\r\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-7_-Parameters,-Return,-and-Libraries22.svg) |![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation:** Stop once all three envelopes are on the screen. <br><br> **Say:** These are functions. We recently learned about functions with parameters and return values. <br><br>![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation:** Click until the library definition appears on the screen. <br><br> **Say:** The envelopes have been grouped together in a folder. This represents a library. A library is a collection of functions that can be used in many different programs.|\r\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-7_-Parameters,-Return,-and-Libraries23.svg) |**Say:** Let's take a look at what's inside the library. If we open up the folder, we see the functions and some documentation. A library should have documentation for each of the included functions. The documentation should include: <ul><li>how each function works</li><li>a complete list of the parameters</li><li>what (if anything) will be returned</li></ul>|\r\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-7_-Parameters,-Return,-and-Libraries24.svg) |**Say:** This detailed type of documentation is also known as **Application Program Interface(API)**. APIs are specifications for how the functions in a library behave and can be used. <br><br> **Discuss:** With a partner, review the parts of the documentation. |\r\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-7_-Parameters,-Return,-and-Libraries25.svg) |**Discuss:** What potential problems could come up if I tried to use a function without knowing what it does or how to interact with it? This would be similar to looking at the front of a function envelope and having to guess: <ul><li>what the function does</li><li>what data type the parameters need</li><li>what is returned</li></ul>**Note:** If students are struggling to come up with ideas, give a few hints: <ul><li>what if there's an error when you run the code which calls this function?</li><li>what happens to a return if you don't store it in a variable or print it to the console?</li></ul> |\r\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-7_-Parameters,-Return,-and-Libraries26.svg) |**Discuss:** My friend wants to use my `findSmallest()` function in her program. Is this function ready to be shared in a library?<br><br>![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation**<br><br>**Say:** Watch out for global variables! If a function accesses or updates a variable elsewhere in your program, that function shouldn't be shared as is.<br><br>![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation**<br><br>**Do This:** With a partner, rewrite the function so it could be shared in a library.<br><br>![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br>**Note:** The problem here, is that the function uses a global variable. Students should try to rewrite the function so only local variables and a return are used. The answer is shown later on in the slides.|\r\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-7_-Parameters,-Return,-and-Libraries27.svg) |**Say:** These are the things you should consider before adding a function to a library: <ol><li>Check for any use of a global variable within the function. If there is, rework the function using local variables and a return. </li><li>Check if another function is called in this function. If so, both functions should be included in the library. </li><li>Write the documentation for the function.</li></ol> |\r\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-7_-Parameters,-Return,-and-Libraries28.svg) |**Say:** Here's the same function, now written to be shared in a library. How does it look compared to yours? It may look a little different - and that's ok, as long as the function works as expected. Now my function is almost ready to be shared in a library. With a partner, write the API for this function: <ul><li>how the function works</li><li>all the parameters, their data types, and a short description of each</li><li>what (if anything) will be returned</li></ul>![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** When the class is ready, click through to see a possible answer. |\r\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-7_-Parameters,-Return,-and-Libraries29.svg) |**Say:** A library needs a name. For our libraries in this class, we are going to follow the following rules: <ul><li>No spaces</li><li>Capitalize the first letter</li></ul>![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** |\r\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-7_-Parameters,-Return,-and-Libraries30.svg) | **Say:** This library can now be shared with others. They can use the functions within their own programs as long as they follow the rules set forth in the documentation.<br><br>![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation**|\r\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-7_-Parameters,-Return,-and-Libraries31.svg) |**Say:** You've seen libraries in action before. The Math library is built into App Lab. Notice the name of the library first, then after a dot, the name of the function and finally the parameters. This is the same formatting you will use to call functions in libraries: Library name, followed by function name, and finally the parameter(s) |\r\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-7_-Parameters,-Return,-and-Libraries32.svg) |**Do This:** Brainstorm with a partner a few functions that might show up in the following libraries: Calculator, DisplayLists, FiterDatabase. <br><br>**Note:** Here are some ideas:<ul><li>**Calculator:** functions similar to what you would find in a common calculator</li><li>**DisplayLists:** functions that help you display a list on a screen in different ways, such as one list item per line or divided with bullet points</li><li>**FilterDatabase:** functions that allow you to filter a database for different things, like all the items that start with the letter \"a\"</li></ul> |"

Here are the steps:\n\n* Re-read the documentation for each library function\n* Add a `console.log()` statement to the end of the program and call a function. Put in a reasonable argument in the space for the parameter.\n\t* For example: `console.log(StringsLibrary.firstLetter(\"pizza\"));`\n* Hit run to see the output. \n* Now add `console.log()` statements to test the rest of the functions. Is the output what you would expect? Try several different inputs.\n\n**Discussion Goal:** Testing the functions allows the end user to understand the behavior of the function. It's helpful for debugging functions, in addition to looking at the code in the library. \n\nFor example: If I call a function whose documentation indicates that it will return the first letter of a string, and instead it returns the last number of a string, I know that there is a problem with the library function and not my project code. \n"

These questions are mapped to topics with each topic having a handful of questions available.\r\n\r\nThe College Board has a few strict guidelines about how topic questions can be used. In particular, students may not receive a grade based on performance on topic questions nor can they be used for teacher evaluation. Beyond these requirements, however, they are primarily intended to formatively assess student progress and learning as they prepare for the end of course exam.\r\n\r\nWithin our own course we recommend that you use them in a variety of ways:\r\n\r\n* Throughout the unit assign topic questions to students related to the topics students are learning about that day or that week\r\n* Prior to the unit assessment assign topic questions to help students practice and prepare for the summative assessment\r\n* After the unit assessment use these topic questions to help students track their progress towards preparation for the AP assessment\r\n\r\n![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/topics7.png)\r\n\r\nClick for more info: [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dqYF5u0AULjw049gaCwAP34ZSe0VuEWbAjWoH1-YMW0/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n"
