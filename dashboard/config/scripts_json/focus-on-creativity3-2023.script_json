In the main activity, students explore a Game Lab tool that allows students to interactively place shapes on Game Lab's 400 by 400 grid. They then take turns instructing a partner how to draw a hidden image using this tool, accounting for many challenges students will encounter when programming in Game Lab.

        "overview": "This lesson introduces students to the process they will use to design games for the remainder of the unit which is centered around a project guide that asks students to define their sprites, variables, and functions _before_ they begin programming their game. Students begin by playing a game on Game Lab where the code is hidden, discussing what they think the sprites, variables, and functions would need to be to make the game. For the purposes of heavily scaffolding the software development process, students are then given a completed project guide that provides starter code and shows one way to implement the game. Students are then walked through this implementation process through a series of levels and have an opportunity to make improvements to the game to make it their own in the final level. In the subsequent lessons, students will need to complete a greater portion of the guide independently, and for the final project, they will follow this process largely independently.\n\n**Question of the Day:**  How does having a plan help to make a large project easier?\n",

Students begin the lesson by looking at an example of a platform jumper, then define what their games will look like. Next, they use a structured process to plan the backgrounds, variables, sprites, and functions they will need to implement their game.

In Code Studio, a series of levels prompts them on a general sequence they can use to implement this plan. Partway through the process, students will share their projects for peer review and will incorporate feedback as they finish their game.

What are the pros and cons of each strategy?\n\n**Discuss:** Allow students to silently record their ideas in writing for a minute. Afterward, invite them to share what they wrote with a neighbor and then finally bring the whole class together to develop a classwide list of strategies.\n\n**Discussion Goal:** This is a quick, low-stakes brainstorm that asks students to bring in their own experiences with word searches and identify strategies they may have used or could use. Student responses may vary but may include the following strategies:\n* Scan each row from left to right followed by scanning each column from top to bottom.\n* Check surrounding letters. Once you found the first letter or a key letter in a word you’re searching for, check the letters around it to see if you should keep going. For example, if you have a word with Q in it, if there’s no U next to it, then you need to keep searching.\n* Look for words that have less-common letters in them such as words with a Q, X, J, or Z\n* Look for words with letter pairs, such as double letters or QU\n* Look for more than one word at a time.\n* Turn the puzzle upside down\n\n**Do This:** Direct students to pick ONE strategy from the list that they want to try and put a “#1” next to it in their journals to indicate it was their first strategy used. Once they pick a strategy, direct students to use that strategy in their word search.\n",

Eventually, we will think about applying the problem-solving process to help us actually program our animations and games, but today, we are going to focus on how to apply the problem-solving process when *designing* animations and games to meet the needs of our users and ourselves.\n",

While completing a drawing the instruction-giver should also not be able to see the computer screen.\r\n\r\n**Drawing 1:** Each member of the pair should complete their first drawing, taking turns giving instructions and using the tool. These drawings do not feature any overlapping shapes, but students may need to grapple with the fact that circles are drawn from the middle and squares from the top left corner. Additionally, students may just struggle with the direction of the Y-axis.\r\n\r\n**Discuss:** Give pairs a couple of minutes to discuss any common issues they're noticing in trying to complete their drawings.\r\n\r\n**Drawing 2:** Each member of the pair should describe their second drawing to their partner. These drawings feature overlapping shapes and so students will need to consider the order in which shapes are being placed as well as when they should change the color of the pen."

Computer screens come in all different shapes and sizes, as does the content we show on them. We need to agree on one point where all the content can grow from. Since we read starting at the top left corner, the grid on a computer screen starts at the top left corner as well. There's also the benefit of not having to use any negative numbers to talk about locations on the screen. Don't worry if this flipped grid is a little tricky still.

This creates an animation effect by changing what is drawn by a small amount each time the draw function runs. This can be compared to a physical flip book, which can animate an image by changing it slightly on each page.\n\n**Misconception Alert!**\n\nWhen the draw loop runs, it does not \"clear\" out the previous drawing, so it will continue to show anything that has not been covered up by the new draw loop. If students do not add a \"background\" at the beginning of the draw loop, they will still see all the images drawn to the screen previously."

Make sure that they go beyond just stating the blocks or code that the counter pattern uses. \n  - They should understand that the counter pattern allows the programmer to update the value of a variable in a pattern that counts up (or down) on every iteration of the draw loop. \n  - This can be used for many different things, such as spinning, growing, shrinking, or timers, but it's most often used to move sprites across the screen.\n- *How does the counter pattern move sprites across the screen?*\n  - When a sprite's x or y property is updated in a counter pattern, its position changes in a consistent way over time, causing it to move across the screen. \n  - Students should be able to explain that movement for an animation is just a change in position and that changing a sprite's x position will cause it to move horizontally, and changing a sprite's y position will cause it to move vertically.\n",

To help smooth out the debugging experience, consider the following strategies:\n\n- Review the [Teacher Guide to Debugging](https://docs.google.com/document/d/145lvpomqz0tUuzXLbkAFgP9zMDpECMwFYiEIG1_hQFg/view) for some common questions and strategies to help support students in debugging their code\n- Have students follow the steps in the [Student Guide to Debugging](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wNwoKDyoUas5GGkhqGmNN1u0XGQEdeOMWhSziyYIf8o/edit#) and use the [Bug Report Quarter-Sheets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M6mnq73DfyvzasucVAwfL-gjl2JqVPzjy_fRx5j4j7c/preview) as an initial step in the debugging process. This helps students prepare and communicate their issue before asking for help.\n- If students haven't seen it yet, consider showing the [Debugging Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auv10y-dN4s) to the class to reinforce debugging best practices.\n\n**Digging Deeper:** Consider supplying students with an object to talk to as part of the debugging process. This is sometimes known as Rubber Duck Debugging - you can learn more on the website https://rubberduckdebugging.com/"

That means that when the computer processes a Boolean expression, it checks to see whether the expression describes a situation that is true or false, and then uses the value of either true or false wherever the expression is found.\n- *What’s an expression that would evaluate to true?*\n  - Some examples of Boolean expressions that evaluate to true are `3 > 1` and `4 <= 7`, but press students to think of expressions that might be better represented by variables, such as `studentAge < 70` or `sizeOfClass > 2`.\n- *What’s an expression that would evaluate to false?*\n  - Some examples of Boolean expressions that evaluate to false are `4 == 7`, `schoolName == \"Hogwarts\"`, and `currentYear < 1000`.\n",

This helps students prepare and communicate their issue before asking for help.\n- If students haven't seen it yet, consider showing the [Debugging Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auv10y-dN4s) to the class to reinforce debugging best practices.\n\n**Digging Deeper:** Consider supplying students with an object to talk to as part of the debugging process.

This helps students prepare and communicate their issue before asking for help.\n- If students haven't seen it yet, consider showing the [Debugging Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auv10y-dN4s) to the class to reinforce debugging best practices.\n\n**Digging Deeper:** Consider supplying students with an object to talk to as part of the debugging process.

It is important to point out that the `drawPlanet` function was called twice which is why there are two planets drawn on the screen, each one a different color and location. Students should also notice the `drawStar` function being called *within* the `drawBackground` function multiple times rather than at the top of the program like the other function calls. You can take this opportunity to discuss how this helped organize and simplify the code since the stars are part of the background.",

This helps students prepare and communicate their issue before asking for help.\n- If students haven't seen it yet, consider showing the [Debugging Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auv10y-dN4s) to the class to reinforce debugging best practices.\n\n**Digging Deeper:** Consider supplying students with an object to talk to as part of the debugging process.
