In this first lesson, students get an overview of what data is and how it is used to solve problems. Students start off with a brief discussion to come to a common understanding of data. They then split into groups and use a data set to make a series of meal recommendations for people with various criteria. Each group has the choices of meals represented in a different way (pictures, recipes, menu, nutrition) that gives an advantage for one of the recommendations. Afterward, groups compare their responses and discuss how the different representations of the meal data affected how the students were able to solve the different problems and see that the same objects can be represented in a number of different ways.\n\n**Question of the Day:** How does data affect decisions we make every day?\n",

The cards used have one of 6 different possible drawings (6 animals, 6 colors, etc.) and so to represent the entire alphabet students will need to work with their groups to use patterns of multiple cards to represent each letter. Students create messages with their systems and exchange them with other groups to ensure the system worked as intended. In the wrap-up discussion, the class reviews the pros and cons of the different systems, discussing commonalities between working systems and recognizing that there are many possible solutions to this problem and what's important is that everyone uses the same arbitrary system to communicate.\n\n**Question of the Day:** How can we create a system for representing information?\n",

Students are given the task of creating an algorithm that could suggest a vacation spot. Students then create rules that a computer could use to make this decision automatically. Students share their rules and what choices their rules would make with the class data. They then use their rules on data from their classmates to test whether their rules would make the same decision that a person would. The lesson concludes with a discussion about the benefits and drawbacks of using computers to automate the data problem-solving process.\n\n**Question of the Day:** How can computers help us make decisions about data?\n",

Students are presented with three scenarios that could be solved using data and brainstorm the types of data they would need and how they could collect the data. Each problem is designed to reflect a real-world service that exists. After brainstorming, students watch a video about a real-world service and record notes about what data is collected by the real-world service and how it is used. At the end of the lesson, students record whether data was provided actively by a user, was recorded passively, or collected by sensors.\n\n**Question of the Day:** How is our data collected and why is it useful?\n",

We've also seen that data can be collected about us constantly, leading to a larger amount of data to analyze - more than a human can handle! In this lesson, students are introduced to the concepts of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning using the AI for Oceans widget. First students classify objects as either \"fish\" or \"not fish\" to attempt to remove trash from the ocean. Then, students will need to expand their training data set to include other sea creatures that belong in the water. In the second part of the activity, students will choose their own labels to apply to images of randomly generated fish. This training data is used for a machine-learning model that should then be able to label new images on its own.\n\n**Question of the Day:** How can machines \"learn\"?\n",

They then interpret the data and use what they have learned to create the recommendation algorithm. Last, they use their algorithms to make recommendations to a few classmates.

For their image representation, they may wonder whether it is even useful to interpret the binary sequences as numbers. In the end, the purpose of defining all data as numbers is less about the \"reality\" of what the ones and zeros represent, and more about how binary is traditionally interpreted.\n\n- For the second question, allow students to think of different ways that the computer would distinguish between different types of data. While it's not necessary for students to come up with any specific answer, challenge them in any ways that involve human interpretation of context, such as knowing that a name is most likely text and age is most likely a number.

        "description": "* What is a disadvantage of using an algorithm to make decisions?\n* What types of decisions would you not want a computer to make automatically?\n\n**Discussion Goal:** Students should understand that automating decisions is convenient in many situations but may lose some elements that humans would consider in a decision. For example: \n\n* Collecting data that's already clean limits what you might collect.\n* Automating decisions means sometimes you get a decision you wouldn't have made on your own\n\nThere are cases where we might want to automate a decision though. For example:\n\n* Where a human might forget / get bored (e.g. automatically re-ordering food when your fridge is low, turning on / off A/C as temperature changes)\n* When there's lots of data to consider for a simple decision (e.g. looking through lots of products to find the one with the lowest price)",

You can even choose to use it entirely on-device, without any webcam or microphone data leaving your computer.* \n\t* If your classrooms devices have cameras, Teachable Machines offers an engaging way to create training sets. Encourage students to teach the machine to represent rock, paper, or scissors with hand gestures. What are some possible ways for bias to enter in?\n\n\n* [Machine Learning for Kids](https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/#!/about) - *This free tool introduces machine learning by providing hands-on experiences for training machine learning systems and building things with them. It provides an easy-to-use guided environment for training machine learning models to recognise text, numbers, images, or sounds.*\n\t* Machine Learning for Kids is a great option if your students want to work with text samples.

The app helps the user to choose a vacation spot, and it uses data about the user's food, superpower, and animal preferences.\n\nThe next question asks students to think about how algorithms are chosen. In a previous lesson, students designed an algorithm for this app by looking at cross-tabulation tables for people who had expressed different preferences. Remind students that the creators can use data they have collected to create their algorithm, rather than just making up their rules from their assumptions about the world."
