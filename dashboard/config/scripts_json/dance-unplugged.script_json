This lesson has been designed for learners of all ages. Students will learn that events are a useful way to control when an action happens, and can even be used to make make multiple things act in sync. In programming, you can use events to respond to a user controlling it (like pressing buttons or clicking the mouse). Events can make your program more interesting and interactive.",

Does anyone have a favorite dance move?*\n\t- *Have you ever watched a dance team perform to music together? How do they stay in sync?*\n\t\t- *One way to do this might be to plan out all of the moves in advance. It's almost like the dancers are programmed! Computer scientists would call this an algorithm because it's a list of steps to get something done.*\n\t\t- *Another way to keep in sync is to have a cue that tells everyone when to change to a different move. Everyone would still need to know what moves to perform and agree on what the cues mean.*\n\t- *If I want everyone in class to clap at the exact same time, I could do that by giving you a countdown from 3.* (Try it!) \n\t- *When I reached \"1\", that was the event that gave you all the signal to clap.*\n- Ask the class if they can think of any other events that could give signals.\n\t- You may need to remind them that you're not talking about an event like a birthday party or a field trip.\n\t- If they have trouble, you can remind them that an event is an action that causes something to happen.\n\t\t- Blowing a whistle\n\t\t- Waving a flag\n\t\t- Saying a magic word\n\t\t- Pressing a button\n- *Today, we're going to organize our class dance party using events.*",
