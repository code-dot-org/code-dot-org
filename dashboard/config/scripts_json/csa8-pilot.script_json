        "description": "This unit assessment is a semester capstone assessment that has a five-day, three-day, and one-day version. The [**Inclusive Playground Project 5 Day Lesson Plans**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14OX2NyeGOrVukSL42XWbTcIrUmkmhj4ktpdEPKc9qaI/edit?usp=sharing) achieve the targeted learning objects and goals while giving students additional time to develop their project. The three-day is the version that is on Code Studio. If there is not enough time for the three-day project, the [**Inclusive Playground Project 1 Day Lesson Plan**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fzY4o36fddjvvj0er420N1kRyOyiY6mr3a5qId-smTM/edit?usp=sharing) is available. In the one-day option, direct students to develop their program on Code Studio in Lesson 13 to submit their project. While the one-day option covers the learning objectives and goals, it shortens development, testing, and reflection time. Consider this tradeoff when deciding which version to use.\n\nIn the three-day version, the unit assessment project assesses proficiency in the knowledge and skills developed in this unit. Students will have three class periods to develop and test the program. Students participate in feedback and testing activities to improve their programs and solve problems. They also reinforce software development practices and their self-image as a software engineer. Lessons 11, 12, and 13 collectively include instructions for the three-day project."
