        "overview": "####**Overview**\n\nThis lesson builds on the coding concepts your students learned in the previous lessons. This micro:bit project lesson allows them to transfer knowledge from the screen into physical projects they can code and hold in their hands.\n\n####**Lesson Plan**\nThis lesson plan is not available on Code.org's website - instead, follow along with the <a href=\"https://code.org/maker/assets/CSF-Booklet-Course-F-Nov2023.pdf#page=29\" target=\"_blank\">lesson plan on pp. 29-31</a> in the micro:bit course booklet. Click <a href=\"https://mbit.io/csf-f4-classroom\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> to start a classroom session for Max-min thermometer with micro:bit.\n\n####**Assessment**\nAfter completing the lesson, assess students' knowledge of the concepts covered by assigning them a content assessment hosted on the JuiceMind platform. To assign the assessment to your students, click <a href=\"https://play.juicemind.com/dashboard/explore/class/codeorg-microbit/unitNumber/4/topicNumber/2/quizId/jeU0ooLL5dfz1eYiXeHW\" target=\"_blank\">here.</a>\n\n::: details [**Setting up a micro:bit classroom session**]\nBefore teaching this lesson, make sure to set up a new classroom on the BBC micro:bit platform. Watch this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QD8kpuSC0Vc\" target=\"_blank\">video</a> to learn how to set up a classroom. \n:::\n\n::: details [**Setting up a JuiceMind assessment**]\nClick \"Assign\" on the assessment page, then have students join your unique class session. Students have a link to the Join page on level 2, and will need to enter the class session code. After students complete the assessment, you can view their results on the JuiceMind teacher dashboard.\n\n**Note**: You will need to <a href=\"https://play.juicemind.com/signup\" target=\"_blank\">sign up</a> for an account on JuiceMind to assign the assessment.\n:::"

Does anyone have a favorite dance move?*\n\t- *Have you ever watched a dance team perform to music together? How do they stay in sync?*\n\t\t- *One way to do this might be to plan out all of the moves in advance. It's almost like the dancers are programmed! Computer scientists would call this an algorithm because it's a list of steps to get something done.*\n\t\t- *Another way to keep in sync is to have a cue that tells everyone when to change to a different move. Everyone would still need to know what moves to perform and agree on what the cues mean.*\n\t- *If I want everyone in class to clap at the exact same time, I could do that by giving you a countdown from 3.* (Try it!) \n\t- *When I reached \"1\", that was the event that gave you all the signal to clap.*\n- Ask the class if they can think of any other events that could give signals.\n\t- You may need to remind them that you're not talking about an event like a birthday party or a field trip.\n\t- If they have trouble, you can remind them that an event is an action that causes something to happen.\n\t\t- Blowing a whistle\n\t\t- Waving a flag\n\t\t- Saying a magic word\n\t\t- Pressing a button\n- *Today, we're going to organize our class dance party using events.*",

To solve this puzzle, place a `set size` block anywhere in your program and use it to change the size of some of your dancers. \n* Dancers created as a group have a default size of 30. Other dancers have a default size of 100.\n\n##### Level 12\n\n* As with the previous level, make sure to only use the `set tint to (color)` block after you have made the dancers in your program. For example, placing it as the first step in the `setup` area of your program will have no effect.\n\n##### Level 13\n\n* With the right code, you should see the dancer cycle through different colors, sizes, or dance moves.\n* Make sure there is a teal `change`, a teal `randomize` block, or a purple `do forever` block connected inside the `every 2 measures` block. \n* Make sure `do forever` blocks are set to either (Next), (Previous), or (Random). Otherwise, the dancer will just perform the set move repeatedly.\n* Note that the **code students write in this level is not checked for correctness**. This means they will always pass the level, even if they do not change the program. Students should feel free to experiment with their code in ways that are interesting to them. Click the “Finish” button to move on.\n* Making new dancers inside the `every 2 measures` block will cause your program to create multiple identical dancers at the same location(s) and may lead to unintended consequences!\n",

(Three additional slides have been provided for this part of the activity if needed.)\n\n\n\n\nOnce the class has had some practice, you can encourage students to nest conditionals inside one another. Make sure they understand that if the card is red, YOUR team is awarded 1 point, and then _nothing else happens_, since the condition was met:\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: Show \"Let's nest conditionals” slide\n\n\n\n\tIf (CARD is RED)\n\t\tAward YOUR team 1 point\n\t\n\tElse\n\t\tIf (CARD is higher than 9)\n\t\t\tAward OTHER team 1 point\n\t\tElse\n\t\t\tAward YOUR team the same number of points on the card\n\n\n\nHere is the same program in pseudocode:\n\n\tIf (card.color == RED ){\n\t\tpoints.yours = points.yours + 1;\n\t}\n\tElse {\n\t\tif (card.value > 9){\n\t\t\tpoints.other = points.other + 1;\n\t\t}\n\t\tElse {\n\t\t\tpoints.yours = points.yours + card.value;\n\t\t}\n\t}"

This lesson is designed to give students an opportunity to tinker with their code and find the visual effects that they like best. \n\nWhile circling the room, encourage students to:\n- **Take Your Time:** Most of the levels require students to find the perfect effects to match their interpretation of the mood of the poem. Staying on a level and tinkering with their code is highly encouraged. \n- **Find a poem you like:** The poem that displays for a student at a new level is just a suggestion. There is a poem dropdown menu with pre-loaded poems at the top of the playspace. Ask students to read through a few and find one that speaks to them. They can then start animating the poem they chose with code. \n\n- **Show off a completed level:** Any level bubble that is fully green means the student successfully completed all the requirements for that level. Ask a student to click on a green bubble to show off what they created. \n\nFor the times when a student feels stuck: \n- **Read the Instructions:** The instructions are bulleted points on how to complete the level. If a student feels stuck, ask them to read the instructions out loud to you and ask them to repeat back what the instructions say in their own words. \n  - <img src=\"https://images.code.org/5b99c663ad6632fe64c9da69d6805c2b-text-to-speech.PNG\" style=\"height: 25px;\"> Students can also click on this text-to-speech icon to hear the instructions read aloud.\n- <img src=\"https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/hint.png\" style=\"height: 35px;\"> **Look for hints**: Most levels include at least one hint with more explicit details about how to pass the level. \n- **Celebrate bugs:** Getting a bug in your code is a natural part of the coding process. If the program isn’t doing what they expected, ask the student to first tell you what they want to happen, click run to observe what is actually happening, then find the place in their code that caused the discrepancy. Remember to celebrate finding bugs and fixing bugs. Getting a bug means students are doing a great job building a more complex program. \n\n",

This can be done in many ways, but here are a few:\n\n* **Public Demo**: Select a few exemplary volunteers to briefly demo their projects in front of the class. As they do so, have them touch on what the planning-to-coding experience was like for them, including ideas they'd still like to implement.\n\n* **Pair Playtesting**: Have students or groups pair up and playtest each other's projects. As they do, ask them to provide positive and constructive feedback to each other. The benefit here is that students will have the opportunity to provide and respond to feedback in a smaller setting.\n\n* **Gallery Walk**: Ensure all students have their projects ready for testing. Have students move \"musical chairs\"-style to another computer and play/test the project there for a few minutes, until they receive a signal from you to move to another computer. Repeat this every few minutes. While there is less opportunity for structured communication here, this ensures students get to demo as many of their peers' projects as possible.",
