Students generate all possible messages with three place values, then create rules that explain how they ordered each message. Emphasis is placed on creating clear rules so that, if another group were to follow the rules, they would generate the same list in the same order.

        "description": "Students should brainstorm individually before sharing in small groups. It is important to allow ample brainstorming time - students may generate familiar responses at first, but may stretch their thinking and get more creative with additional time. Some examples may include:\n\n* Linguistic examples - \"seven\", \"siete\" (spanish), \"sept\" (french), \"sieben\" (german), etc\n* Picture examples - dots, tallys, emojis, etc\n* Math & Geometry examples - 5 + 2, 8 - 1, a seven-sided shape, etc\n\nAfter a short time, ask students to share some responses with the whole class. Use these responses to quickly generate a wide variety of representations.\n\n**Discussion Goal:** Introduce the idea that the numeral '7' is just one commonly used symbol to represent the number seven. There are many ways to communicate this same number that may use different symbols or representations, all of which are valid. Sharing the variety of responses helps motivate the following activity that asks students to discover a system for using the circles and squares to represent numbers, including the number 7.\n"

You might see students representing one pattern at a time, then discussing the rules for “replacing” shapes to generate each of the next patterns. Students might not use the manipulatives at all, using pen & paper or whiteboards instead.\n\n**Many Possible Answers:** It is okay for different groups to come up with different orders for their lists of patterns - this will help with the share-out discussion as you highlight different strategies.\n\n**Facilitating With Groups:** You should act as a facilitator during this part of the activity, guiding students in describing the rules & strategies that they used to create their list. These strategies may be implicit and unconscious to the student, but you can ask questions to help students realize their own thinking that went into generating their list. Aim to help students clarify their thinking to make it easier for other groups to follow.\n\n**Group Dynamics:** Be mindful of groups that appear to be dominated by a single student.
