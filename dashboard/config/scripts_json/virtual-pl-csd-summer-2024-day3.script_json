This creates the effect of drawing an ellipse somewhere on the right side of the screen.\n\nWhen facilitating the class discussion, ensure that students look at their neighbors screen and compare - this helps them see that different behaviors are occuring for different people. Also encourage students to run the code multiple times to see the result."

What about its outline?\n* What if you wanted to change any of those values during your program, or control other things like rotation?"

It's okay if students also bring in some of their own experiences with animations and sprites, but emphasize that in Game Lab: a sprite isn't the animation or image itself, but the container that we can attach an image to. This helps manage expectations in the next few levels, where a sprite is just a gray rectangle until we learn to add animations to it.\n\n\n",
