It's okay if students also bring in some of their own experiences with animations and sprites, but emphasize that in Game Lab: a sprite isn't the animation or image itself, but the container that we can attach an image to. This helps manage expectations in the next few levels, where a sprite is just a gray rectangle until we learn to add animations to it.\n\n\n",
