        "overview": "This lesson builds off prior activities involving spelling and recognizing capital letters. Spelling with the bee helps students in kindergarten and first grade practice following and counting sequences of letters that form words. They use a series of coding commands to move a spelling bee across a grid of letters in order to spell words. Students learn how to use drag-and-drop coding blocks to move their character, and the importance of sequencing commands in the correct order so they can spell a word.\n\n####Prerequisite Skills\nThis lesson is not intended to introduce students to the alphabet, sequences of letters to form words, or counting. Students should come into this lesson with prior knowledge and the skills to be able to:\n\n- recognize uppercase letters of the alphabet.\n- recognize and count numbers up to 10 using fingers, objects, or manipulatives.\n- recognize that words are made up of a sequence of letters.\n",
        "preparation": "- Students will need accounts on Code.org to engage with certain aspects of this lesson. If you’ve ever done an Hour of Code activity with Code.org, the steps to set up your class are similar. You can use the following resources to prepare for introducing students to the Code.org platform:\n  - [Creating a Class Section](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/115000488132-Creating-a-classroom-section)\n   - [Creating Accounts for Students](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/202114633-Creating-accounts-for-students-and-adding-them-to-your-section)\n  - [The Student Experience on Code.org](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/115001347791-The-student-experience-on-Code-org)\n\nOnce these steps are complete, students will be able to access the resources that are a part of this lesson. You may need to plan for a little extra time to help students log in for the first time so they can access the puzzles in this lesson.\n- Play through the levels to find any potential problem areas for your class.\n",

Staying on a level and tinkering with their code is highly encouraged. \n- **Collaborate with Neighbors:** Encourage students to check in with a neighbor when they're getting stuck. Depending on the age and ability of your students, you might consider formally breaking your class into pairs to complete the tutorial using [pair programming](https://youtu.be/vgkahOzFH2Q).\n- **Read the Instructions:** The instructions are bulleted points on how to complete the level. If a student feels stuck, ask them to read the instructions out loud to you and ask them to repeat back what the instructions say in their own words. \n  - <img src=\"https://images.code.org/5b99c663ad6632fe64c9da69d6805c2b-text-to-speech.PNG\" style=\"height: 25px;\"> Students can also click on this text-to-speech icon to hear the instructions read aloud.\n- <img src=\"https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/hint.png\" style=\"height: 35px;\"> **Look for hints**: Most levels include at least one hint with more explicit details about how to pass the level. \n- **Celebrate bugs:** Getting a bug in your code is a natural part of the coding process. If the program isn’t doing what they expected, ask the student to first tell you what they want to happen, click run to observe what is actually happening, then find the place in their code that caused the discrepancy. Remember to celebrate finding bugs and fixing bugs. Getting a bug means students are doing a great job building a more complex program. \n\n",
