They annotate the question as a class, then implement a full `SpiralPainter` class in pairs through an \"Around the World\" style activity.\n\nThe goals of this lesson are threefold: \n* Create a sense of excitement and accomplishment around completing FRQs\n* Practice an FRQ style question (written by hand)\n* Serve as a summative assessment of the content from Unit 1\n\nWhile the format of this FRQ is not the same as an FRQ on the AP exam, it is a building block to help students prepare to tackle these types of questions. As students progress through the course, the FRQ questions they encounter slowly become closer to the real thing.\n",

It is completed in three class periods to plan and create the program, including implementing a new class that extends `PainterPlus` with a new behavior. Student participation in planning and feedback activities to improve their programs and solve problems reinforce software development practices and self-image as a software engineer. Lessons 16, 17, and 18 collectively include instructions for the three-day project.\n\nIf there is not enough time for the three-day project, a one-day option is available that achieves the targeted learning objectives and goals. If using this option, refer to the [**Asphalt Art Project 1 Day Lesson Plan**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pAL3TeKjgDpwqNGo1rSfXjohTXlhJB7rjtFpUT78ID8/edit#) , which includes a one-day version of the [**Asphalt Art Project Planning Guide**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vO1opBEGne6rC2OzyulevXK6pfRH9NURyAlpITN3l4w/edit#). Direct students to develop their program on Lesson 18 so they can submit their project. While the one-day option covers the learning objectives and goals, it shortens planning and reflection time. Consider this tradeoff when deciding which version to use."
