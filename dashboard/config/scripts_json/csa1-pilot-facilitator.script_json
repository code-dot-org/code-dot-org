They annotate the question as a class, then implement a full `SpiralPainter` class in pairs through an \"Around the World\" style activity.\n\nThe goals of this lesson are threefold: \n* Create a sense of excitement and accomplishment around completing FRQs\n* Practice an FRQ style question (written by hand)\n* Serve as a summative assessment of the content from Unit 1\n\nWhile the format of this FRQ is not the same as an FRQ on the AP exam, it is a building block to help students prepare to tackle these types of questions. As students progress through the course, the FRQ questions they encounter slowly become closer to the real thing.\n",
        "preparation": "* Print out the station instructions and the manipulatives in the Print Outs resource.\n* Cut out the manipulatives.\n* Gather a blue, orange, and pink colored pencil or marker for each student (optional)",
