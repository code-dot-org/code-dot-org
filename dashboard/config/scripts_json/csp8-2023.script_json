        "description": "### Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy\n\n* **Learning Through Full-class Simulation:** The simulation project that runs through this unit serves several important goals. It helps contextualize what students are learning by moving from abstract ideas of privacy or security to concrete potential innovations. Since the simulation is based on modernizing schools, students can consider the consequences of computing innovations in a familiar setting. By taking on an assigned role and interacting with a group of teammates who have done the same, students must consider a breadth of interests and goals beyond their own when it comes to innovating in schools. \n\n* **Ending the Year as \"Deciders\":** A major theme students engage with throughout this unit is the need to consider both sides of technological innovation. Computing technology has led to both benefits and harms to culture, economy, and society at large. Responding to important questions facing our world requires understanding technology and an ability to identify and interpret the impacts it causes. This unit is not designed to advocate for any particular point of view on the impact of technology. Still, it should empower students to adeptly see and weigh the consequences of the technology around them. While the Create PT may feel like the most significant project of this course, the Explore Curricular requirement and the questions faced in this unit are arguably more crucial. Many of the young people who take CS Principles may pursue studies or careers in which they are \"creators\" with technology, but all of them will need to be thoughtful \"deciders\" in a world profoundly shaped by computing. \n\n\n### Major Assessment and Projects\n\nStudents complete the Future School Convention simulation throughout this unit. Working in teams of roughly five people, students are assigned a role and a set of interests they'll need to investigate. They research real-world innovations that could improve schools and align with the interests of their character. Throughout the unit, they are given opportunities to refine their proposals as a team and debate the benefits and risks of different computing innovations. Eventually, their team submits an overall proposal for the Future School, and all students vote for the team and innovation they believe to be the best. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with the CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n\n### AP Connections\n\nThis unit and unit project helps build towards the enduring understandings listed below. For a detailed mapping of units to Learning Objectives and EKs please see the \"Standards\" page for this unit.\n\n* IOC-1: While computing innovations are typically designed to achieve a specific purpose, they may have unintended consequences.\n* IOC-2: The use of computing innovations may involve risks to your personal safety and identity.\n\nThis unit includes content from the following topics from the AP CS Principles Framework. For more detailed information on topic coverage in the course review [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RniAGymLBBpIpDaNNR5Ea8CgiiUKv0tMvaDixSj6m_Q/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n* 5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects\n* 5.6 Safe Computing"

The goal here is to move individual students to think broadly about their opinions, not force every student to have the same opinion. It's not necessary that students agree, but prompt them to think critically about this important question posed by modern technology. Some ways to do this:\n\n* Ask them why they hold their opinions and ask them to tie them to today's lesson\n* Ask them to give specific examples\n* Ask students who disagree to politely debate their opinions\n* Ask students to tie their opinions to their own experiences\n\n\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Review:** Review the key takeaways at the end of the lesson."

There is one layer of protection, that is centered around something you know: your password. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click through animation** |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-10---Cybersecurity-and-Global-Impacts2.svg) |**Say:** Two factor authentication adds another layer. <br><br> **Prompt** What do you think is another way of protecting your data? <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click through animation** <br><br> **Say:** In addition to something you know, another layer is something you possess like a phone. Have you ever been required to put a phone number in when getting a password authenticated? Sometimes a text will be sent to your phone with a code to enter in, proving that you are the person who has the phone. This layer means someone who just guesses your password can't get in to your account - they would also need access to your phone. |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-10---Cybersecurity-and-Global-Impacts3.svg) |**Prompt:** What are the problems with this system? How could it be hacked? <br><br> **Goal:** Guide the discussion towards the answer that a phone could be stolen or a sim card lost. |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-10---Cybersecurity-and-Global-Impacts4.svg) |**Prompt:** There's another layer that can be used to protect your data. Can anyone guess what it is? <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click through animation** <br><br> **Say:** If you guessed something physical or perhaps \"biometrics\", you are correct! <br><br>![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click through animation** <br><br> A fingerprint is an example of this. A retina scan of your eye is another example. These three options: something you know, something you possess, and something you are make up multifactor authentication, which involves at least two of these options and preferably all three. If someone tried to access your account, they would be required to know your password, have access to your phone and your fingerprint! |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-10---Cybersecurity-and-Global-Impacts5.svg) |**Prompt:** Why is this better than Single Factor Authentication? What are the challenges with the system? Is it worth any of the risks? <br><br> **Note:** Allow students time to think through these prompts, perhaps in small groups before having a whole class discussion. Multifactor authentication can keep data more protected than single factor authentication, but it requires extra steps which add time and often money (the cost of a phone, etc.). There are also privacy concerns with having your fingerprints or retina scanned. |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-10---Cybersecurity-and-Global-Impacts6.svg) |**Say:** Another way to protect your data involves updating your software. | \n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-10---Cybersecurity-and-Global-Impacts7.svg) |**Say:** Let's review. What is a virus? <br><br> **Note:** Give students an opportunity to glance through the notes and review computer viruses from lesson 7. |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-10---Cybersecurity-and-Global-Impacts8.svg) |**Say:** Do you remember how to protect your device from a computer virus? <br><br> **Note:** Allow students to suggest different forms of protection before clicking through the animation. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click through animation** <br><br> **Say:** Two things you can do: use virus scanning software and update system software. You could also say, keep all software updated! |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-10---Cybersecurity-and-Global-Impacts9.svg) |**Say:** Data protection is a moving target. It's not a one and done process. It's not enough to install virus protection software and never thing about it again! New viruses and threats are constantly being developed - you need to keep your software up to date and use the best authentication practices you can in order to keep your data safe! |",

SSQRP is designed to assess how well you understand the various issues surrounding computing innovations. The good news is, you aren't expected to have any prior knowledge about the computing innovations discussed in these questions - they are all made up. You will have a short reading passage followed by five multiple choice quesions that focus on data, purpose and effect, benefits and harms, and security concerns. SSQRP is present on the AP CSP exam, and there will be two in the end of unit assessment.",
