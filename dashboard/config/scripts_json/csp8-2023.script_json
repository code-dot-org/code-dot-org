This will create a new copy of the program that can be accessed from the list of individual student projects found at [https://studio.code.org/projects](https://studio.code.org/projects). Students should indicate using comments what parts of the program are copied from older projects. \n\n**For students who are creating an entirely new program:**\n\nCreate a new App Lab project by visiting [https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/new](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/new)\n\n**How Can You Help as a Teacher:** Review the [Course and Exam Description](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf), in particular pages 170-171  to understand how you as a teacher can and cannot assist on the Create Performance Task.\n"

This is a general checklist of things you should do to prepare for the AP Performance Task.  Let's see how we did. With a partner - one person reading from the top down, the other reading from bottom up - check off things we've done to prepare so far.  Identify anything we haven't done. Discuss together before discussing as a class. Also, Read Page 11: AP Computer Science Principles Policy on Plagiarism. With a partner carefully read this section. Discuss together before discussing as a class.*\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Do This:** Make sure everyone understands expectations.\n\n* For example: if you use a library that someone else created, you need to include a comment citing this source as code you yourself did not write\n* If using images, media or other copyrighted material found on the web, you should cite those sources in comments in your program code - usually at the top.  Something like:\n\n```\n// The images used in this app came from:\n// [1] bird image - http://name-of-site.com/path/to/image.jpg\n// [2] flower image - http://site.com/path/to/flower.jpg\n```",
