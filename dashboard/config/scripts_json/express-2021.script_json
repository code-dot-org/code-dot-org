Connect it inside the `setup` block.\n* You have now written your first program. Make sure to press Run to see what happens. You should hear music and see a character start to move in the display area.\n\n#### Level 4\n\n* Levels 4-5 are about making the dance interactive. \n* The green blocks are event blocks. These blocks start a new sequence of code and do not need to be connected inside the `setup` block. \n* Connecting the purple block under the green event block allows you to make the character perform a dance by pressing the orange arrow buttons or keys on your keyboard.\n* Make sure to press the arrow buttons after pressing Run or the dancer(s) won’t move.\n\n#### Level 5\n\n* Make sure to bring out a second purple `do once` block. You should have a `bears do once` block and a `cats do once` block in your workspace. Both should be connected to a green `when pressed` event block.\n* Make sure to press the arrow buttons after pressing Run or the dancers won’t move.\n\n#### Level 7\n\n* Levels 7-8 are about synchronizing the dance to the music. \n* The `after measures` event blocks also start a new sequence of code and should not be connected inside the `setup` block.\n* Connecting the purple `do forever` block under the green `after measures` event block should make the character perform a dance move after the number of measures you indicate.\n* The `do forever` block works differently from the `do once` blocks seen in the previous levels.\n\n#### Level 8\n\n* Make sure to bring out a second green event block.  You should have a `after 4 measures` block and a `after 6 measures` block in your workspace. Both should have purple block connected underneath.\n\n#### Level 9\n\n* Level 9 is about creating groups of dancers quickly.\n* Use the new block provided into the toolbox to create a set of smaller dancers.\n*You should also use the normal `make a new` block to create a larger “lead” dancer.\n* Many students will be familiar with the idea that you can make something seem to be further away by drawing it a smaller scale. In the next level you’ll be able to fine tune this effect.\n\n#### Level 11\n\n* Levels 11-13 are about adjusting the properties (e.g. size, color) of the dancers.\n* It is important to make sure that the teal `set` block is placed somewhere in the program *after* the dancers have been created. To solve this puzzle, place a `set size` block anywhere in your program and use it to change the size of some of your dancers. \n* Dancers created as a group have a default size of 30. Other dancers have a default size of 100.\n\n#### Level 12\n\n* As with the previous level, make sure to only use the `set tint to (color)` block after you have made the dancers in your program. For example, placing it as the first step in the `setup` area of your program will have no effect.",

Otherwise, the dancer will just perform the set move repeatedly.\n* Note that the **code students write in this level is not checked for correctness**. This means they will always pass the level, even if they do not change the program. Students should feel free to experiment with their code in ways that are interesting to them. Click the “Finish” button to move on.\n* Making new dancers inside the `every 2 measures` block will cause your program to create multiple identical dancers at the same location(s) and may lead to unintended consequences!\n\n\n#### Level 15\n\n* This last level is very open-ended. The tutorial itself is designed to give students ample time to keep working on their own dance.\n* **Encourage Sharing:** If students have cell phones with a data plan they can quickly text a link to their projects to their own phone or a friend's. If your school policy allows it, encourage them to do so here.\n* **Encourage Creativity:** Creativity is important throughout this lesson, but this is true here more than anywhere else!"

During online activities, the role of the teacher is primarily one of encouragement and support. Online lessons are meant to be student-centered, so teachers should avoid stepping in when students get stuck. Some ideas on how to do this are: \r\n\r\n - Utilize [r pair-programming-vid] whenever possible during the activity.\r\n - Encourage students with questions/challenges to start by asking their partner.\r\n - Unanswered questions can be escalated to a nearby group, who might already know the solution.\r\n - Remind students to use the debugging process before you approach.\r\n - Have students describe the problem that they’re seeing. What is it supposed to do? What does it do? What does that tell you?\r\n - Remind frustrated students that frustration is a step on the path to learning, and that persistence will pay off.\r\n - If a student is still stuck after all of this, ask leading questions to get the student to spot an error on their own.\r\n\r\n**Discuss:** After providing students with end-of-class warnings, grab everyone's attention and get them to reflect on the experiences that they just had.\r\n\r\n - Did anyone feel frustrated during any of the puzzles?\r\n - Did anyone notice the need to be persistent?\r\n\r\n**Transition:** Have students grab their Thinkspot Journals and take a moment to leave lessons for themselves.",

If you make sure that everything is working line by line, then when you get to the place that your code isn't doing what it's supposed to, you know that you've found a bug.

If you were to say \"while there is a hole, fill it with dirt\" what would they do? How long would they do that?\r\n\r\nWhen you use a word like “while”, you are relying on a condition to tell the computer how long the loop should run. A condition is a statement that is tested and found to be true or false. In the case above, the condition is if there is a hole. It’s only possible for there to be a hole or for there not to be a hole, thus the statement is only ever true or false.\r\n\r\nTell the students they will be learning about a new kind of loop. Previously, students only used loops to repeat a command a certain number of times. Here, they won't always know how many times to repeat the command, however, they will know when to stop or when to keep going. `While` loops allow the programmer to repeat a command as long as a condition is still true. In the previous example, the condition is the existence of a hole.\r\n\r\nIf there's time, have the students discuss other times using a `while` loop would be useful. Examples include:\r\n\r\n - Running toward a ball **while** it is in front of you.\r\n - Filling a glass **while** it has space for more liquid.\r\n - Walk forward **while** there is a path ahead.",

        "description": "To celebrate students' work, spend the last 10 minutes or so allowing them to showcase their projects. This can be done in many ways, but here are a few:\r\n\r\n* **Public Demo**: Select a few exemplary volunteers to briefly demo their projects in front of the class. As they do so, have them touch on what the planning-to-coding experience was like for them, including ideas they'd still like to implement. \r\n* **Pair Playtesting**: Have students or groups pair up and playtest each other's projects. As they do, ask them to provide positive and constructive feedback to each other. The benefit here is that students will have the opportunity to provide and respond to feedback in a smaller setting. \r\n* **Gallery Walk**: Ensure all students have their projects ready for testing. Have students move \"musical chairs\"-style to another computer and playtest the project there for a few minutes, until they receive a signal from you to move to another computer. Repeat this every few minutes. While there is less opportunity for structured communication here, this ensures students get to demo as many of their peers' projects as possible.",
