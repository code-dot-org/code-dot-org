        "overview": "In this lesson, students apply the problem-solving process to three different problems in order to better understand the value of each step. They will solve a maze, organize a team to race as fast as possible, and design a game. The problems grow increasingly complex and poorly defined to highlight how the problem-solving process is particularly helpful when tackling these types of problems. The lesson concludes with students reflecting on their experience with the problem-solving process. They will justify the inclusion of each step and will brainstorm questions or strategies that can help them better define open-ended problems, as this is often the most critical step.\n\nThis lesson will likely take two class periods or more to complete. The first two problems may fit into a single class period but the third will need to be moved to a second day.\n\n**Question of the Day:** How can we apply the problem-solving process to many different kinds of problems?\n\n\n**This is an alternate activity to [Exploring Problem Solving](/s/fcs1c-beta-2024/lessons/3/)**",
        "preparation": "* Print the activity guide for each student\n* Scratch paper for the Partner Race Relay problem\n* Poster to record strategies for defining problems in wrap up discussion",

Run this conversation as a brainstorm, recording ideas on the board. Note and call out similarities in characteristics.  Students may come up with counter examples for some of the common characteristics.  Remind them that you are brainstorming and that it's important to consider all of the possible ideas, and that they will have more time to think about this question in the lesson.\n\n**Discussion Goal:** This warm-up starts students thinking about what the defining characteristics of a computer are. Students do not need to have a definition of a computer, but they should start to think about the different types of computers in their lives and what they have in common.\n\n**Note:** The programmers pictured are Elizabeth Jean Jennings Bartik and Frances Bilas Spence. The computer pictured is the ENIAC."

This does not need to be a final draft and is just there to help them brainstorm ideas and communicate to another group how their app would look. On the right side they have space to label each individual piece of information on the screen.\n\nUsing the outputs that students selected as a guide, students should pick the inputs they'll need to create them. Only 6 spaces are provided though students could opt to choose more. This is somewhat intentional to help students scope the functionality of their app.\n\nStudents will describe the way their app processes data using as a model the way they would process it themselves. The goal here is primarily just to ensure students have selected inputs that could be processed to produce the outputs. For example, if they're finding a list of friends with birthdays this month then both a computer and human would need to know a list of friends' birthdays and the current month.\n\nLastly students are asked to decide what information, if any, it makes sense to store long term.\n\n**Distribute:** Apps and Problem Solving - Peer Review, one copy to each pair of students\n\n**Step 7: Peer Review**: Each group should trade their project guides with another. They should fill out the first line of the peer review which asks what specific part of their project they'd like feedback on. Afterward, there are a number of directed questions as well as a chance to provide more open-ended feedback on the idea.\n\nStudents should be given their project guides back as well as their peer feedback.

Once each step has been discussed, move on to the second question. This question may have many responses and you should allow students to share their thoughts and experiences. If it doesn't arise naturally as you leave the conversation offer some or all of the ideas mentioned in the discussion goals.\n\n**Discussion Goal:** Students have practiced using the problem-solving process on a number of different problems. Help them synthesize the notes they have been keeping to better understand the role of each step and the value of the problem-solving process in general. A sample set of conclusions is below but you should allow students to share your own insights before offering your own.\n\n**Define:** without defining a problem you might solve the wrong problem, not know where to start, or not know when you're finished\n\n**Prepare:** Even well-defined problems usually have many possible approaches. Make each try more likely to succeed by first examining your options and anticipating challenges\n\n**Try:** Without trying you'll never get anywhere. It's important to be persistent and patient so long as your plan still may work\n\n**Reflect:** You'll likely not solve the problem the first time or there will be a better way to solve it.

It helps you make progress when the way forward may not always be clear.\n",

(And why does that problem exist?) Keep asking to get to the heart of the problem.\n* How could I be able to tell the problem had been solved? What could I observe or measure?\n\n"
