During online activities, the role of the teacher is primarily one of encouragement and support. Online lessons are meant to be student-centered, so teachers should avoid stepping in when students get stuck. Some ideas on how to do this are: \n\n - Utilize ***Pair Programming** whenever possible\n - Encourage students with questions/challenges to start by asking their partner\n - Unanswered questions can be escalated to a nearby group, who might already know the solution\n - Remind students to use the debugging process before you approach\n - Have students describe the problem that they’re seeing. What is it supposed to do? What does it do? What does that tell you?\n - Remind frustrated students that frustration is a step on the path to learning, and that persistence will pay off.\n - If a student is still stuck after all of this, ask leading questions to get the student to spot an error on their own."

We suggest:\n\t- Counting to 10\n\t- Singing “Old MacDonald”\n- Once their plan is underway, interject button presses sporadically.\n- Continue the blend until they understand the difference between actions that are guided by a plan and those that are event driven."

As they do so, have them touch on what the planning-to-coding experience was like for them. \n* **Pair Storytelling**: If you have a big class or are shorter on time, have students or groups pair up and demo their projects that way. \n* **Gallery Walk**: Ensure all students have their projects ready for testing. Have students move \"musical chairs\"-style to another computer and run the project there and read the story. When they receive a signal from you, they should move to another computer.
