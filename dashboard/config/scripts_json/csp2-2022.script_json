        "description": "### Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy\n\n* **Inventing the Internet with the Internet Simulator:** This unit features many different versions of the Internet Simulator, a digital widget that simulates how different features or \"layers\" of the Internet work. As students move from lesson to lesson, the version of the Internet Simulator they use will have slightly more functionality than the last. Lessons will present students with challenges that closely mimic those that the internet's original inventors needed to solve. Students will collaboratively design and test solutions to those problems to develop an intuitive understanding of how the internet works and why it was designed that way. By the end of the unit, students will have \"invented the internet\" themselves! \n\n* **Continuing to Establish a Strong Classroom Culture:** Much like the Digital Information unit that comes before it, this unit emphasizes collaborative problem solving and developing a supportive and inclusive classroom culture. \n\n### Major Assessment and Projects\n\nThe unit project asks students to design a policy position for an imaginary political candidate related to an \"Internet Dilemma.\" Students must analyze news stories about their topic to identify impacted groups, explain those groups' interests, explain technical background about the dilemma, and then recommend a policy solution that the candidate should advocate for. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n\n### AP Connections\n\nThis unit and its associated project help build towards the enduring understandings listed below. For a detailed mapping of units to Learning Objectives and EKs, please see the \"Standards\" page for this unit.\n\n* CSN-1: that computer systems and networks facilitate how data are transferred\n* IOC-1: and that while computing innovations are typically designed to achieve a specific purpose, they may have unintended consequences\n\nThis unit includes content from the following topics from the AP CS Principles Framework. For more detailed information on topic coverage in the course review [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dqYF5u0AULjw049gaCwAP34ZSe0VuEWbAjWoH1-YMW0/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n* 4.1 The Internet\n* 4.2 Fault Tolerance\n* 5.2 Digital Divide"

They look at the router logs again to notice that messages are being passed between routers in order to reach their destination.

        "purpose": "Information on the Internet is not sent all at once, but is instead broken into smaller chunks of data called packets. Each packet is sent through the Internet individually and may actually take different paths or arrive at different times than others. Once they arrive the receiver will use the packets to recreate the original file.\n\nTwo protocols used to send data as packets are UDP and TCP. The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) simply sends all the packets. If some arrive out of order or are entirely missing there's no system to fix the errors. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) numbers packets before sending them so that the receiver can correctly reorder the packets and request missing packets be resent. \n\nOnly one of these two protocols will be used, depending on the situation. TCP takes longer than UDP because of the error-checking done to guarantee every packet was received. TCP is used to send information like emails, images, websites, and more where saving fractions of a second is less important than accuracy. In instances like live-streaming television or online gaming where speed is most important, UDP will be used since it is faster and there's less benefit to correcting errors.\n\nThis lesson gives students a hands-on experience with the ideas behind both protocols and helps them understand the implications of splitting large files into packets when sending them online.\n\nNote: UDP is not covered in the video at the end of the lesson.\n",

So why not get to know it?\" But you don't have to take Vint Cerf's word for it. Some of the largest issues facing society hinge on an understanding of how the Internet functions.\n\nAt the end of this unit you will do a project focusing on a societal issue. As you go through these lessons keep you ears and eyes open for how things work.\n\nMany of the issues are related to people taking advantage of the open protocols that make the Internet function and present us with tricky dilemmas. We will learn about protocols later in this unit. \n\nFor example, there are two major issues to think about:\n\n* Net Neutrality is a raging legal debate about the principle that Internet service providers should enable access to all content and applications regardless of the source, and without favoring or blocking particular products or websites.\n\n* Internet Censorship is the attempt to control or suppress what can be accessed, published, or viewed on the Internet by certain people. This can be used to protect people (i.e. to not allow access to child pornography) but can also be used to limit free speech.\n\nIn order to have an informed opinion, it helps to understand the technical underpinnings of how the internet works.\n\nFinally, a major issue that our society faces is that far too few people actually understand how the Internet works!

Instead, the router sends the message along a different path.\n* One of the paths may have been ‘cut’ like in the activity from Unit 2-Lesson 2, requiring the message to take a different path.\n\nStudents should use these new vocabulary words to describe these reasons, especially how the different paths can help make the network fault-tolerant.

What matters is speed.\n* In the second case there'd need to be some kind of record keeping to make sure that every book was recorded as well as the order it was placed in.\n* In both cases you wouldn't move the entire library at once, you would move boxes or chunks of books at a time.\n\nNote this is a tight lesson with a significant wrap up.
