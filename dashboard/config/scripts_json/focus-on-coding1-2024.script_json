The lesson begins by anchoring the formal problem-solving process in some real-life experiences they already have solving problems by asking students to brainstorm all the different types of problems that they encounter in everyday life. Students are then shown the four steps of the problem-solving process and work together to relate these abstract steps to their actual experiences solving problems. First students relate these steps to the problem activities from the previous lesson, then a problem they are good at solving, then a problem they want to improve at solving. At the end of the lesson, the class collects a list of generally useful strategies for each step of the process to put on posters that will be used throughout the unit and year.\n\n**Question of the Day:** What are some common steps we can use to solve many different types of problems?\n",

You might consider administering it on an admin day at school, or as an early homework.\n\n**When should I give the survey?** Because it is a pre-course survey it is important that students take it as early in the course as possible before they have had much (or any) exposure to the class so that we may accurately gauge changes in attitudes and beliefs caused by the course.",

The [r how-to-administer-a-locked-assessment/csd/2021] document provides details on how to do that when you are ready. Note that the instructions for administering an assessment and a survey are the same.    \n\n**How much time does it take?** The survey does take some time - it is roughly 30 questions.  You might consider administering it on an admin day at school, or as an early homework.\n\n**When should I give the survey?** Because it is a pre-course survey it is important that students take it as early in the course as possible before they have had much (or any) exposure to the class so that we may accurately gauge changes in attitudes and beliefs caused by the course.",

If you attended a Code.org professional learning workshop during the summer, you should already have this access.\n\nTo check whether you have access:\n\n1. Navigate to the [Unit 1 course overview page](https://studio.code.org/s/csd1-2023)\n2. Do you see the CS Discoveries Pre-course Survey as the first \"stage\" of the course?\n3. If not, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdGGAJuaDMBVIRYnimPhAL96w6fCl4UdvhwmynGONM75TWwWw/viewform). Note that it can take a day or so to become a verified teacher account, so please do this step early!\n\nIf you are *not* a verified teacher account, you can still create a section for your class, but you will not be able to administer the pre-course survey on the first day.\n\n\n#### Create a class section on Code Studio.\n\nTo create a section:\n\n1. Navigate to the [Teacher Home Page](https://studio.code.org/home)\n2. Click 'New section' under 'Classroom Sections'\n3. Choose 'Email Logins' \n4. In the space provided, give your section a name (e.g. CSD Period 1), the grade of your students, Course: 'Computer Science Discoveries', Current Unit: 'Unit 1: Problem Solving', and click 'Save'\n5. Once the section is created, click the name of the section\n6. On the new page, you will see a unique Join URL that you will distribute to your students in the class. \n\nFor a video walkthrough of these steps and more on navigating your Code.org account, go to the [Code.org How-to Video Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7-6SpcrToamXzSMUKkEYZfKTzi6gJos5)",

You might consider administering it on an admin day at school, or as an early homework.\n\n**When should I give the survey?** Because it is a pre-course survey it is important that students take it as early in the course as possible before they have had much (or any) exposure to the class so that we may accurately gauge changes in attitudes and beliefs caused by the course.",

If you attended a Code.org professional learning workshop during the summer, you should already have this access.\n\nTo check whether you have access:\n\n1. Navigate to the [Unit 1 course overview page](https://studio.code.org/s/csd1-2023)\n2. Do you see the CS Discoveries Pre-course Survey as the first \"stage\" of the course?\n3. If not, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdGGAJuaDMBVIRYnimPhAL96w6fCl4UdvhwmynGONM75TWwWw/viewform). Note that it can take a day or so to become a verified teacher account, so please do this step early!\n\nIf you are *not* a verified teacher account, you can still create a section for your class, but you will not be able to administer the pre-course survey on the first day.\n\n\n#### Create a class section on Code Studio.\n\nTo create a section:\n\n1. Navigate to the [Teacher Home Page](https://studio.code.org/home)\n2. Click 'New section' under 'Classroom Sections'\n3. Choose 'Email Logins' \n4. In the space provided, give your section a name (e.g. CSD Period 1), the grade of your students, Course: 'Computer Science Discoveries', Current Unit: 'Unit 1: Problem Solving', and click 'Save'\n5. Once the section is created, click the name of the section\n6. On the new page, you will see a unique Join URL that you will distribute to your students in the class. \n\nFor a video walkthrough of these steps and more on navigating your Code.org account, go to the [Code.org How-to Video Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7-6SpcrToamXzSMUKkEYZfKTzi6gJos5).",
