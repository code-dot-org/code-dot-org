        "overview": "This **project** lesson takes students through the process of designing, developing, and showcasing new projects!",
        "preparation": " - Spend time making your own project with both the Artist and Sprite Lab. Familiarize yourself with the capabilities and limitations of each tool.\r\n - Modify the rubric to fit your class goals and print out a copy for each student.\r\n - Modify the project design worksheet to fit your class and print one packet for each student.",
        "purpose": "Students may be ready to jump straight into building their projects, but this lesson will help shape their ideas into plans. This structure will keep the dreamers grounded and illuminate a path for those feeling left in the dark. Provide students with ample time to build and revise their projects. The trial and error inevitably involved in this lesson will teach problem solving and persistence.",
        "student_overview": "Projects this big take time and plenty of planning. Find your inspiration, develop a plan, and unleash your creativity!"

        "description": "* **empathy**: to imagine the feelings that someone else is experiencing\n* **interpret**: to understand something based on our point of view\n\n**Before the lesson**: As an optional activity before the lesson, have students play the [E-volve](https://www.digitalpassport.org/evolve.html) game in Digital Passport™ by Common Sense Education. This will help introduce key concepts of this lesson. To see more, check out the [Digital Passport Educator Guide](https://d1e2bohyu2u2w9.cloudfront.net/education/sites/default/files/tlr-asset/document-bundled-educator-guide-92018.pdf).\n\n**Project** [Slide 4](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kUVxRuQ_CUDpeSm3Sqg4yyueITjc3qQMUpSTi0WP4so/edit#slide=id.g3da8846a99_1_0) and ask students: *Imagine when you walked in, I said to you* [in a friendly tone, with a big smile] *\"Hello!\" Which emoji would fit?*\n\nHave students show their answer by holding up fingers (1, 2, 3, or 4). If anyone holds up a number other than 1, ask them to share out why.\n\n**Repeat** this two more times, saying *Hello* differently each time: once with an angry tone and a scowl, and once with a nervous or scared tone.\n\n**Project** [Slide 5](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kUVxRuQ_CUDpeSm3Sqg4yyueITjc3qQMUpSTi0WP4so/edit#slide=id.g3da8846a99_2_13) and ask: *What about if you're just reading it? How does it make you feel now?*\n\nPoint out how when something is just in text, it can be even more difficult to interpret what someone means. Explain that their responses might be different depending on who they are because we all interpret the world a little differently. Clarify that interpret means *to understand something based on our point of view.* ([Slide 6](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kUVxRuQ_CUDpeSm3Sqg4yyueITjc3qQMUpSTi0WP4so/edit#slide=id.g3d844aea9e_1_4))\n\n**Say**: *Because words can be interpreted differently by different people, it's important to think about the words we use and how they affect people. We might say something just to be funny, but someone might take it seriously, and it might hurt their feelings. This can happen in person, and it can also happen online. It may even happen more online, because the words are just text -- we're not actually face-to-face with other people.*",

Define empathy as *imagining the feelings that someone else is experiencing*.

As they do, ask them to provide positive and constructive feedback to each other. The benefit here is that students will have the opportunity to provide and respond to feedback in a smaller setting.\n- **Gallery Walk:**  Ensure all students have their projects ready for testing. Have students move \"musical chairs\"-style to another computer and play/test the project there for a few minutes, until they receive a signal from you to move to another computer. Repeat this every few minutes. While there is less opportunity for structured communication here, this ensures students get to demo as many of their peers' projects as possible.\n",

As they do so, have them touch on what the planning-to-coding experience was like for them, including ideas they'd still like to implement.\n\n* **Pair Playtesting**: Have students or groups pair up and playtest each other's projects. As they do, ask them to provide positive and constructive feedback to each other. The benefit here is that students will have the opportunity to provide and respond to feedback in a smaller setting.\n\n* **Gallery Walk**: Ensure all students have their projects ready for testing. Have students move \"musical chairs\"-style to another computer and play/test the project there for a few minutes, until they receive a signal from you to move to another computer. Repeat this every few minutes. While there is less opportunity for structured communication here, this ensures students get to demo as many of their peers' projects as possible.",

Since this tutorial includes videos and students may be wearing headphones it can get easy to \"go into a bubble\". Help break those barriers by actively pairing students.\n* **Read the Instructions:** The instructions usually provide helpful information about what is happening behind the scenes. \n* **Go back and try different things:** If students finish quickly, encourage them to go back to \"Train More\". In the last part of the activity, students can also go back and choose a \"New Word\". More training data tends to make the machine learning model more accurate and consistent.

What do you suppose the process would be like for me to send a message to request that page?_\n\t- _What do I do as a user?_\n\t- _What do you think happens inside the internet?_\n\nSending a message over the internet is a lot like sending a message through the mail...if every letter we sent required thousands of envelopes!\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** Show “Packets” slide\n\nEvery message we send through the internet gets chopped up and each piece is wrapped in its own version of an envelope. We call those packets. Packets are specially formed chunks of information that are able to easily flow through any of the internet's channels.\n\nSometimes, a few of those packets will get lost, because the internet is a crazy place. In that case, the packets need to be resent, and the whole message has to get put on hold until they arrive.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** Show “Servers” slide\n\n_Where do you think those packets are headed?_\n\n- Even if you're sending messages to another person, they first have to go to at least one server.\n\t- A server is a special computer that is supposed to be always on and ready to send and receive information.\n\t- Every website has a server.\n\t- Even email goes through servers.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** Show “IP Addresses” slide \n\nServers don't have names like you and I do. They're actually addressed using numbers. These numbers are called IP addresses, and they look a little strange.\n\n- For example: One of Code.org's IP addresses used to be 54.243.71.82\n\t- (Please be sure to check this out in advance. Most IP addresses change from time to time and they are then reused for other sites.)\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** Show “DSL, Cable, Fiber Optic, or WiFi” slide\n\nThere are many ways to reach the internet from your house, school, or place of business.\n\n- You can connect directly using a cable (that might be DSL, Cable, or Fiber Optic)\n- Or you can connect using radio waves over the air through Wi-Fi.\n\nDirect connections are most reliable, but they can be inconvenient.\n\n- *Can you figure out why?*\n\t- (You have to be attached to a cable!)\n\nWi-Fi connections are super convenient, but the aren't always reliable.\n\n- *Can you figure out why not?*\n\t- (Radio waves bounce all over the place and can get lost.)"
