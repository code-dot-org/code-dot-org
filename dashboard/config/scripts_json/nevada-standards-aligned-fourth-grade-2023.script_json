In this activity, students will read aloud instructions as they learn to code with events in Bounce to make a game. Once the game is complete, students will provide play-by-play commentary as their classmates predict which way the ball will bounce in order to score. Students will also complete a Frayer model about bar graphs prior to creating a scaled bar graph using the data collected during their game.\n\n*Standards Addressed:*\n\n- **CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RF.3.4:** Read with sufficient accuracy and fluency to support comprehension.\n\n- **CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.SL.3.4:** Report on a topic or text, tell a story, or recount an experience with appropriate facts and relevant, descriptive details, speaking clearly at an understandable pace.\n\n- **CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.3.MD.B.3:** Draw a scaled picture graph and a scaled bar graph to represent a data set with several categories. Solve one- and two-step \"how many more\" and \"how many less\" problems using information presented in scaled bar graphs. \n\n- **NGSS.3-PS2-2:** Make observations and/or measurements of an object’s motion to provide evidence that a pattern can be used to predict future motion. \n\n"

Before giving students the answer, ensure they've carefully looked at the instructions, hints, videos, and any starter code carefully.\n\n\n- <img src=\"https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/hint.png\" style=\"height: 35px;\"> **Stuck?

All of a sudden, our chorus would be a function of repeated actions, rather than words.\r\n- Use the concepts of the arrows from the Graph Paper Programming lesson and create a program with lots of repeating instructions.\r\n\t- Circle those repeating actions so that the class can see where they are.\r\n\t- Define a function called \"Chorus\" above the program.\r\n\t- Cross out everywhere the repeating actions appear in the program and write \"Chorus\" instead.\r\n- Repeat until the class can go through this process with little direction."

In a function declaration, you fill in the function with code and you give the function a name. You must declare a function before you can use it.\n\n2. **The Call**:\n\tFunction calls are what makes the program run the code in the function. To call a function, you place the name of the function in your program. Make sure your function is properly defined before calling it in your program.\n    \nThe class can use songwriting as an example to understand these two components. In the unplugged activity, the function containing the lyrics to the chorus was named \"chorus\". When we first made this function, we circled the lyrics that would go in the function. Once we named the function, we could read through the lyrics and replace the repeated chorus lyrics with a function call to \"chorus\".\n\nContinue the conversation until students have a basic understanding of functions being declared and called. If students don't get to this point, make sure to do one of the bridging activities before moving into the Code.org puzzles."

Since this tutorial includes videos and students may be wearing headphones it can get easy to \"go into a bubble\".

In the last part of the activity, students can also go back and choose a \"New Word\". More training data tends to make the machine learning model more accurate and consistent.

What do you suppose the process would be like for me to send a message to request that page?_\n\t- _What do I do as a user?_\n\t- _What do you think happens inside the internet?_\n\nSending a message over the internet is a lot like sending a message through the mail...if every letter we sent required thousands of envelopes!\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** Show “Packets” slide\n\nEvery message we send through the internet gets chopped up and each piece is wrapped in its own version of an envelope. We call those packets. Packets are specially formed chunks of information that are able to easily flow through any of the internet's channels.\n\nSometimes, a few of those packets will get lost, because the internet is a crazy place. In that case, the packets need to be resent, and the whole message has to get put on hold until they arrive.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** Show “Servers” slide\n\n_Where do you think those packets are headed?_\n\n- Even if you're sending messages to another person, they first have to go to at least one server.\n\t- A server is a special computer that is supposed to be always on and ready to send and receive information.\n\t- Every website has a server.\n\t- Even email goes through servers.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** Show “IP Addresses” slide \n\nServers don't have names like you and I do. They're actually addressed using numbers. These numbers are called IP addresses, and they look a little strange.\n\n- For example: One of Code.org's IP addresses used to be 54.243.71.82\n\t- (Please be sure to check this out in advance. Most IP addresses change from time to time and they are then reused for other sites.)\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** Show “DSL, Cable, Fiber Optic, or WiFi” slide\n\nThere are many ways to reach the internet from your house, school, or place of business.\n\n- You can connect directly using a cable (that might be DSL, Cable, or Fiber Optic)\n- Or you can connect using radio waves over the air through Wi-Fi.\n\nDirect connections are most reliable, but they can be inconvenient.\n\n- *Can you figure out why?*\n\t- (You have to be attached to a cable!)\n\nWi-Fi connections are super convenient, but the aren't always reliable.\n\n- *Can you figure out why not?*\n\t- (Radio waves bounce all over the place and can get lost.)"
