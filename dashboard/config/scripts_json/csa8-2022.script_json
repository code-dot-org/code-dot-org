Students recall that the insertion sort algorithm inserts the element into the correct position and shifts the rest of the elements over. Students note that the merge sort algorithm is a recursive algorithm that repeatedly divides the list into smaller lists until each list contains only one value and then merges the elements back together into one list.

Students work on the project throughout the unit to brainstorm, plan, and begin developing their program. Students then have three dedicated class periods to refine and complete their projects. Lessons 11, 12, and 13 collectively include instructions for the three-day project.\n\nIf there is not enough time for the three-day project, a one-day option achieves the targeted learning objectives and goals. If using this option, refer to the [**Creative Coding with the Console Project 1-Day Lesson Plan**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WXSawrRLw9sb1EBnCU2SwYBNPuWvAKKx58v0ZUlpqaU/edit?usp=sharing). Direct students to develop their program on Lesson 13 to submit their project. While the one-day option covers the learning objectives and goals, it shortens planning and reflection time. Consider this tradeoff when deciding which version to use."
