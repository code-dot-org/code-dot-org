Interactive models and simulations are used in the real world to help engineers and scientists identify patterns, understand nature, make predictions about future changes, and design solutions to prepare for and/or combat major disruptions. \n\nStudents will explore examples of evolution, adaptation, migration, natural selection, and survival in groups. The lesson concludes with a creative project where students create a hypothesis for a potential future aquatic animal adaptation to survive overfishing.\n",

Then, you will limit the area in which the boat is allowed to fish. Third, you’ll create a fishing season and a no fishing season to allow the fish time to recover.
