It is completed in three class periods to plan and create the program, including reading and analyzing data and creating a drawing or animation to visualize the data. Students participate in planning and feedback activities to solve problems, reinforce software development practices and self-image as software engineers, and improve their programs.\n\nIf there is not enough time for the three-day project, a one-day option achieves the targeted learning objectives and goals. If using this option, refer to the [**Abstract Data Art Project 1-Day Lesson Plan**](https://studio.code.org/s/csa4-2023/lessons/15). While the one-day option covers the learning objectives and goals, it shortens planning and reflection time. Consider this tradeoff when deciding which version to use."
