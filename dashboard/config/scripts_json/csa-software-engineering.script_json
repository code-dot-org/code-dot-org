Through hands-on exploration and practice, they learn to clone repositories, make commits, push changes, manage branches, and work with pull requests in GitHub to expose students to the collaborative practices and tools common in the software development industry.",

These are super important tools that software developers use all the time, and you're about to get the inside scoop. We'll learn how to track changes in our code, work together on projects, and keep our code neat and tidy. You'll get to play around with creating your own code repositories, making updates, and even merging different versions of code – just like real software developers! Plus, we'll get to see how code reviews work IRL, which are all about helping each other write the best code possible. This isn't just textbook stuff; it's real-world skills that will make you a coding superstar in no time."

So for instance, on March 16, we added some code to our project with a note in the version control system that we added a User class. Then on April 21, we added more code to our project with a note that we added the Menu class. On May 3, we changed some code in our project and added a note in the version control system that we changed the Menu options._\n* _Git is a type of version control system that allows software engineers to create their own copies of the main project and make modifications separately from the main project. When they are ready to merge those changes back to the main project, they can then push those changes up to the main project. So for instance, Tasha makes a copy of the main code, makes some changes that are separate from the main code, then makes some more changes, then pushes those changes to the main code. Malik also makes a copy and makes his own changes separate from the main code AND Tasha's code and pushes those changes to the main project when he's ready._"
