For this and the next slide, you might choose to say something like:\n\n* _Version control systems allow us to create snapshots of our project at specific times. So for instance, on March 16, we added some code to our project with a note in the version control system that we added a User class. Then on April 21, we added more code to our project with a note that we added the Menu class. On May 3, we changed some code in our project and added a note in the version control system that we changed the Menu options._\n* _Git is a type of version control system that allows software engineers to create their own copies of the main project and make modifications separately from the main project. When they are ready to merge those changes back to the main project, they can then push those changes up to the main project. So for instance, Tasha makes a copy of the main code, makes some changes that are separate from the main code, then makes some more changes, then pushes those changes to the main code. Malik also makes a copy and makes his own changes separate from the main code AND Tasha's code and pushes those changes to the main project when he's ready._"
