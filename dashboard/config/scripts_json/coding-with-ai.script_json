Some people think that use of AI will make programming obsolete, others think it will merely make programmers better at their jobs. Some may think that any job AI can do is freeing people from labor, others may worry what happens to the workers in our labor-based economy if AI takes over jobs. Find a student with their thumb down (who thinks programmers will lose their jobs over this technology) to call on and explain their answer. Find a student with their thumb up to do the same. "

When it is time to rotate, have one of the lines move over by one person while the other line stays put when the time is up for each round.\n* If your student desks are arranged in rows, direct every other row to turn their seat around, facing the row behind them. When the time is up for each round, rotate the students sitting at the backward-facing desks. \n\nIf students are close enough to hear what the pairs next to them are saying, you might also consider having them move 2-3 people over after each round rather than move to the next person. This might help students hear new thoughts than those right next to them. \n\n**Prompt Tip**: The first three prompts on the activity guide are the ones that students should answer during this activity. If you think your students would benefit more from discussing any of the other prompts, feel free to provide guidance on which prompts to answer. Going through three prompts should take 6 minutes (2 minutes each). However, if you have extra time and you would like your students to continue reflecting and discussing with more classmates during this Speed Chat Reflection activity, you can also have your students use more than the first three prompts. \n\n**Timing Tip**: A 2-minute timer with music has been provided for you in the activity slides to help you keep track of when to have students rotate. If you have a different, preferred way to keep track of time, or you can extend the rounds beyond 2 minutes, please feel free to delete the 2-minute timer video.\n"
