        "description": "The unit assessment project assesses proficiency in the knowledge and skills developed in this unit. It is completed in three class periods to plan and create the program, including reading and analyzing data and creating a visual or animation to visualize the data. Students participate in planning and feedback activities to solve problems, reinforce software development practices and self-image as software engineers, and improve their programs. Lessons 11, 12, and 13 collectively include instructions for the three-day project.\n\nIf there is not enough time for the three-day project, a one-day option achieves the targeted learning objectives and goals. If using this option, refer to the [**Abstract Data Art Project 1 Day Lesson Plan**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19BDqcw742tyflnFUkT8xd-0OvDkIVxkGNKOb68lZBKM/edit?usp=sharing), which includes a one-day version of the [**Abstract Data Art Project Planning Guide**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cbA6Fvp9TpCSI7G_KybWcpNAXE6w_nV1qN6HQZFcrpM/edit?usp=sharing). Direct students to develop their program on Lesson 13 to submit their project. While the one-day option covers the learning objectives and goals, it shortens planning and reflection time. Consider this tradeoff when deciding which version to use."

For students who did not meet the learning expectation, follow up so they have the opportunity to learn from errors made on the assessment."
