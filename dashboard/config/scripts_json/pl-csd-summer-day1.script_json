You could consider creating a \"Resource Chart\" to keep track of these options and support students to be self-sufficient as they progress through levels.\n\n* **Level Instructions:** Instructions may introduce small pieces of new content. Each level features a \"Do This\" section explaining what students are supposed to do in that level. Set the expectation early that reading these instructions, not just the \"Do This\" section, is important.\n* **Help and Tips Tab** This tab contains all of the relevant videos and reference guides for a particular level.\n  - **Videos:** Watched as a class, but students can always return to them.\n  * **Reference Guides:** Contain text and diagrams explaining content. These are intended as helpful student resources, not class readings. They are a good place to go for review after learning content or when students get stuck in levels. You may decide to print these and have them available for students as they work through levels.\n* **Documentation** A link to Web Lab's documentation is available in the upper-right corner of the instructions panel. Students can use this to refresh their memory on important tags introduced in the unit."

Talking about the organization, structure, or role of the content in the page (heading, paragraph, list, etc.) is more accurate than talking about specific aspects of its appearance (such as size or spacing).\n\nFor the second prompt, there's a direct answer: the paragraph tag separates text into paragraphs. You may want to follow up this question by asking students how they think a web browser for the blind might deal with paragraphs. For example, while sighted people may use spacing and new lines to separate out paragraphs, what should a screen reader do?\n\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Key Vocabulary:**\n\n- HTML - Hypertext Markup Language, a language used to create web pages\n- HTML Element - A piece of a website, marked by a start tag and often closed with an end tag\n- HTML Tag - The special set of characters that indicates the start and end of an HTML element and that element's type\n",

So, for example, the structure could include different headings and paragraphs but would say nothing about the color of text or how big it is displayed. The style of the page is the specifics of its appearance. Without a particular style, each web browser would decide how to display different web page elements on its own.\n\nStyles are important to allow web developers to decide exactly how a web page looks on the screen. Because styles are separate from structure and content, web developers can change the style of an entire page very easily, without having to make any changes to the structure and content of the web page. This means that it's very easy for web pages to have an individual look and feel that is unified across the entire page.\n\n**Circulate:** Support students as they continue through the first set of skill building levels."
