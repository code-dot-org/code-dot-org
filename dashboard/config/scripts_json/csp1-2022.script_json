        "description": "### Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy\n\n\n* **Establishing a Strong Classroom Culture:** This unit is designed to be hands-on, collaborative, and exploratory. A major focus of the unit is building a positive classroom culture in which students work together, explore problems, and communicate about their thinking. Most lessons either feature physical manipulatives or a digital widget, and the bulk of lesson time should be spent with students exploring these tools together to develop an understanding of the concepts they highlight. The course intentionally does not start with programming since, in many classrooms, some students have experience with programming and others do not. Choosing to begin with digital information and the internet lets you build community in the room while exploring a topic that is likely to be accessible to all students. The supportive and inclusive classroom environment built in this unit should help set a positive tone that can be carried through the school year.\n\n\n* **Empowering \"Deciders\":**  An important goal of the course is not merely to teach students technical knowledge, but to put those skills to work in meaningful ways. This unit builds towards the unit project, which provides an opportunity for students to be \"deciders\" about the impacts of computing on modern life. Other units will emphasize empowering units as \"creators.\"\n\n### Major Assessment and Projects\n\nThe unit project asks students to consider and debate issues that arise in modern society due to the digitizing of information. Students will analyze an article that addresses the intersection of digitizing information and current events. They will evaluate what data is being digitized and evaluate the benefits and harms caused by making this information digital. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n\n### AP Connections\n\nThis unit and its associated project help build towards the enduring understandings listed below. For a detailed mapping of units to Learning Objectives and EKs, please see the \"Standards\" page for this unit.\n\n* DAT-1: The way a computer represents data internally is different from the way the data is interpreted and displayed for the user. Programs are used to translate data into a representation more easily understood by people.\n* IOC-1: while computing innovations are typically designed to achieve a specific purpose, they may have unintended consequences\n\nThis unit includes content from the following topics from the AP CS Principles Framework. For more detailed information on topic coverage in the course review [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dqYF5u0AULjw049gaCwAP34ZSe0VuEWbAjWoH1-YMW0/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n* 2.1 Binary Numbers\n* 2.2 Data Compression\n* 5.5 Legal and Ethical Concerns."

        "description": "Students should brainstorm individually before sharing in small groups. It is important to allow ample brainstorming time - students may generate familiar responses at first, but may stretch their thinking and get more creative with additional time. Some examples may include:\n\n* Linguistic examples - \"seven\", \"siete\" (spanish), \"sept\" (french), \"sieben\" (german), etc\n* Picture examples - dots, tallys, emojis, etc\n* Math & Geometry examples - 5 + 2, 8 - 1, a seven-sided shape, etc\n\nAfter a short time, ask students to share some responses with the whole class. Use these responses to quickly generate a wide variety of representations.\n\n**Discussion Goal:** Introduce the idea that the numeral '7' is just one commonly used symbol to represent the number seven. There are many ways to communicate this same number that may use different symbols or representations, all of which are valid. Sharing the variety of responses helps motivate the following activity that asks students to discover a system for using the circles and squares to represent numbers, including the number 7.\n"

These strategies may be implicit and unconscious to the student, but you can ask questions to help students realize their own thinking that went into generating their list.

Students should notice that the resulting decimal values are all powers of 2.</li><li>**Challenge 3 - Conversion Practice:** This section gives students more practice converting between number bases. The last two decimal numbers, 256 and 513, are too big to represent using the Flippy Do, however students should make the connection that more bits could be added to the left of the Flippy Do using increasing powers of 2.</li><li> **Challenge 4 - Putting it all Together:**   The last four questions on the Activity Guide ask students to apply their understanding to new situations. The first two questions ask students to describe what happens to the value when 0’s are added to the left or right of a binary number. The last two questions ask students to think about how many bits are required to represent specific values in binary.</li></ul> <br><br> **Note:** As you circulate, take an opportunity to be a Lead Learner. Help students discover the items below using the suggested questions:<br><br><ul><li>**Reading a number vs. Placing a Number:** Do we fill in the places on the Flippy Do starting on the left or right? Does it matter? (Yes. If we have a 5-bit number, we actually use the 5 bits on the far right. If we were to use the bits on the far left, this changes the value of the number. This is similar to adding more zeros to a decimal number.)</li><li>**Highest value possible with a given number of bits:** What is the largest number we can make with 4 bits? Is the last number we can make always odd? (A meaningful pattern is that we can count as high as one less than the next bit on the left. If we have four bits, we can count up to the number 15, because the next bit has a value of 16.) </li><li>**Number of numbers we can make:** How many total unique numbers are possible with 4 bits? (This is a base 2 number system. With each new bit, we double the amount of unique numbers we can make. With four bits, we can make the decimal numbers 0 to 15 (0000 to 1111), for a total of 16 unique numbers.)</li></ul>   \n"

With ten digits on our hands and feet, the decimal (base 10) number base was natural for humans to develop.  The ten symbols we use for this number base are the digits 0-9.   For a computer, however, it makes more sense that data be represented in binary (base 2), as this can easily be interpreted with electrical switches set to two states: ON or OFF.  The two symbols we use for this number base are the digits 0 and 1.\r\n\r\nBoth number bases take advantage of the concept of place value.  In decimal, numbers are composed of powers of 10, increasing in value from right to left.  Binary is similar, however we use powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.).  Expressed in binary, these values are 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, and so on.  These make up the incremental place values in the binary number system.\r\n\r\n**Why Binary?**\r\n\r\nStudents will see in a later lesson how computers use binary numbers as a representation of electrical signals on a wire. The wire is always set to one of two different options: on or off. Off can be reprsented with a 0 and on with a 1. \r\n"

Each pencil line smoothly connects to the next, no matter how much you zoomed in on the picture with a magnifying glass. \r\n\r\nWhen we represent an analog image digitally, we will have to make some choices on how to sample the image to get the smoothest representation possible while keeping in mind the number of bits it takes to build that image. \r\n\r\nWhat does it mean to sample? We are choosing how small to make section of the picture we look at when deciding whether to make it black or white. The smaller the sample, the more pixels required to represent that image.
