Be prepared to address the following situations in this discussion:\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t<br />3) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherimoya\">cherimoya</a> is a fruit common to South America, but may not be a common fruit your students have heard of. It’s possible many students may say “this isn’t a word”, but one or two students may speak up because they’re familiar with this fruit. Be sure to elevate those voices and highlight how our own knowledge is sometimes limited by lack of exposure to different words or phrases. Or, if no one raises this point, be sure to point this out to students explicitly such as showing them the Wikipedia page. In either case, make sure cherimoya is classified as a “word” before leaving the discussion\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t<br />8) ullaakkut and 10) yá'át'ééh are both words in other languages - <a href=\"https://www.adventurecanada.com/canadian-high-arctic-and-greenland/ullaakkut-a-guide-to-inuktitut-for-beginners\">ullaakkut means hello in Inuktitut</a>, a language spoken by Inuit peoples in Canada and Greenland; and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h0tbtlZx0A\">yá'át'ééh means “hello” in the Navajo / Diné language</a>. Similar to above, students may initially classify these as not words because they are unfamiliar with them, but it is important to surface the meaning and use of these words to students either with a quick google search or elevating the voice of a student in class who is already familiar with these words. As a result, make sure these terms don’t end up in the “Not Words” category by the end of the discussion.\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t<br />4) wierd is a misspelling of either the word “weird” or the word “wired”. Students may initially say that this is “not a word”, but another student or yourself should challenge them by pointing out that if this is typed into a device with autocorrect, it will automatically correct it to one of these other words. Even in this slide deck, the word has a red squiggly underline representing that the computer recognizes it as something, even if it’s not a correctly spelled word. This may inspire the class to create a new category to represent this term - it’s not a correctly spelled word, but it’s also not a made-up word, so maybe there’s a new category for “misspelled words” or “important terms that aren’t words”. Let students guide how they want to handle this situation, even if they decide not to make a new category and it remains in “not word”.\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t<br />At some point, students who are more familiar with the Scrabble game may try to invoke the “rules of Scrabble” which restrict words in other languages, proper nouns, or abbreviations. From this perspective, words (8) and (10) above would be restricted, as would 5) Reykjavik (the capital of Iceland) and 9) ATM (since it is an abbreviation for Automatic Teller Machine). If this comes up, use this as an opportunity to question the effect that arbitrary rules have on what we consider valid language, since these are all definitely words that are used in society even if not officially allowed in Scrabble. You could consider creating new categories to represent these phrases, such as “Still words but not allowed in Scrabble” or “Part of language, but not allowed in Scrabble”. Or, the class could decide these belong in the Words category, regardless of what Scrabble thinks, and that’s the end of the story.\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t<br /><i class=\"fa fa-lightbulb-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> <strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> Ultimately, this is an exercise to surface that the way we identify words versus nonsense - much like Calvin and Hobbes in the comic panel - can be contextual to our lived experiences and influences what we consider important information versus random noise that can be ignored. It’s okay if the discussion ends without closure, so long as students have wrestled with how what they initially considered “words” may have been expanded as they were exposed to new contexts in the discussion. However, be very intentional that the discussion ends with very few items in the “Not Words” category, especially making sure ullaakkut and yá'át'ééh are not in this category and are instead classified as either a Word or a new category the class has created."

Students may pick up on this and ask what the models really “know” or “understand” at this point, or you may hear students saying the model “knows what this word means” which isn’t quite correct. At this stage, all we’re doing is building a “word bank” that a model can recognize and eventually reproduce. But the model doesn’t have any inherent understanding of the meaning of these words - this happens in later steps and later lessons. If we asked a model to respond to a prompt just with the training done today, it could generate any of the words students are putting on their posters, but the results would be random and nonsensical since it doesn’t have any tools to help it make decisions about which words are best used in which situations. Nevertheless, this is a necessary step in understanding how a language model works - a model can’t even begin to “understand” a word if it’s not even included in it’s training data."

If you were to teach the lesson below, here's what we would suggest (it may make more sense to read the lesson plan first, then return to this list):\n- The current introduction to the activity is unclear. When introducing the activity, emphasize that the job is to curate data sources that will be used to train an AI. If students are familiar with a \"web crawler\" that automatically downloads websites on the internet: we're like a version of that, where we can decide which websites to download and use as examples to train a new AI model.\n- There are too many choices. Have the entire class look up the same topic - we recommend using either recipes or movie reviews.\n- Only have students look up one article instead of two.\n- Remove the bottom portion of the activity guide. Just have students focus on headlines, author, date, and 1-2 sentence summary\n- The second half of the lesson can be run as a full class, with students sharing out articles they found. Then you (and the class) can start to notice similarities amongst all of the articles\n  - Focus on similar authors (male vs female), similar timeframe (just from the last year), and similar summaries (did everyone look up recipes for fast food? Did everyone look up movie reviews for the same kinds of movies?)\n- The takeaway from the lesson is unclear. It can be helpful to say this explicitly: \"Bias in large language models happens at a large scale - it's not just one data source that contributes to bias, but when you have a collection of sources that implicitly emphasize or exclude certain things\"\n- Help students see their role in this process, as someone who chooses what sources to include in a language model (similar to the warm-up, where we can choose where to live which influences the new words we learn).

Another common way to make this comparison is visually, by graphing certain dimensions of words in a 2D or 3D space. If you’d like to explore this further, we recommend the <a href=\"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/WordEmbeddingDemo/\">Word Embedding Demo from Carnegie Mellon University</a>. When the page loads, it provides a visualization of several words mapped onto a 3D space. They have a <a href=\"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/WordEmbeddingDemo/tutorial.html\">tutorial available</a> that explains more about how this works. This can be an option to show students if they are interested, but graphing words on 2D or 3D spaces is not something students are expected to do in this course so we have avoided it in the lesson and instead present it as an option."

This particular discussion focuses on safety concerns and what an acceptable level of risk is when making decisions with machines like this. Some students may think the consequences - a life-threatening reaction - may necessitate removing this risk from the system altogether. Others may think that, since this is something where personal judgement can be applied by just a subset of users, it may be fine to let this network keep designing meals with peanuts. Focus the conversation on wrestling with both sides of the debate, elevating student voices to think critically and carefully about the scenario. It’s likely - and acceptable - for the discussion to end in a place of non-closure - instead, aim for students having come to their own decision that they can justify from the scenario and their lived experiences.\n\t\t<br />\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n\n</table>    \n    ",

Some kitchens avoid nuts altogether so consumers can be sure they won’t have an allergic reaction. Others apply warnings saying “These items were baked in a facility that includes nuts” as a warning for people to use their own judgement and discretion. From a machine-learning perspective, this scenario is relatable to stories where an AI model or chatbot was released and then needed to be adjusted after the release to account for a bias or harm they had not considered or intended.

        "description": "**For the Teacher:** In this game, you know the secret rules (explained below) and are reacting to the suggestions that the class makes. As the class suggests words, you tell them whether or not words are accepted or rejected. This game requires students to notice patterns in the words that are accepted or rejected, and use those patterns to inform the guesses they make. The goal of the activity is for students to eventually discern the rules of the game from these patterns.\n\n**The Rules:** The secret of the game is: words with double letters are accepted and all others are rejected. This is why Teeth is accepted (because of the double e’s) while Mouth is not (because no letter is repeated). This is also where the name of the game comes from - Green Glass Door all have double letters.\n\n**Playing the Game:** Ask students to suggest words and write them down somewhere visible, then tell the class whether the Green Glass Door accepts or rejects each word. Instead of doing this one-at-a-time, it can be helpful to take words in batches - like 3 to 5 at a time - and then mark each one as accept or reject in a batch. It’s important to leave all guesses in a visible spot so students can look at the data to inform their next guesses. Over time, students may start to notice the pattern - that words with double-letters are accepted - and start guessing those more frequently. If students are struggling to catch on, it can be helpful to rewrite the list so several accepted words are together and several rejected words are together. You can also provide your own examples, or reference the name of game - Green Glass Door - as a hint.\n\n**Managing Expectations:** This activity has a specific type of engagement that some students may struggle with: the activity deliberately starts with 0 knowledge, so most answers are likely to be incorrect rather than correct. Some students may struggle with randomly guessing and getting it incorrect more often in the beginning. However, this is exactly the mindset that is necessary to carry forward into the rest of the lesson and is an important part of how machine learning really works: machines make an enormous amount of incorrect guesses that are gradually refined over time before eventually getting more and more accurate.\n\n**Ending the Game:** As the game continues, some students will discovered the rule while others may not. Encourage the students who think they know to keep it a secret until others have caught on. Using your judgement, when enough students feel like they know the rule, continue to the next slide to reveal the rule of the game",

To help facilitate this initial conversation and gather our initial data, don’t take it too seriously and consider leaning into the playful aspect of just making guesses and seeing what happens. It also helps to move quickly through this round, since any correct answers will likely be due to luck rather than strategy.\n\n**Laughing in a Conversation:** Some students may be very skeptical that it’s possible to try and have a conversation when you don’t understand any of the words. As a potential talking point, consider asking students if they’ve ever had trouble hearing someone and instead of asking them to clarify, they just laugh or smile or nod. Conversation strategies like this make it possible to continue conversations without having full context. In some ways, we are doing something similar in this first conversation of this activity."

There will still be instances where students may be surprised, but by using patterns from the previous conversation, their accuracy should increase."

If students aren’t able to think up these vocabulary words in response to these questions, consider finding time for students to review the big ideas and vocabulary from this unit in a later class period, but avoid the instinct to dwell on it in this moment."

It introduces this Attention Mechanism, wrapped up in a special kind of computing architecture called a Transformer (essentially the combined Storage and Processing components in our model). Before presenting these slides, you should consider exploring the interactive website [“Generative AI exists because of the transformer” from the Financial Times](https://ig.ft.com/generative-ai/). This interactive website offers a similar explanation as the one to follow, with very engaging graphics and visuals. You can also consider showing it to students to reinforce the concepts on the next few slides, although it does go into more depth than is required in this unit."

It can be very easy for this to slip into the realm of “favorites” or “preferences”, where groups might argue one word is better than others for a variety of reasons. Ideally, the structure of this lesson steers away from these conversations by leaving that choice up to mathematics and probability - we aren’t making any kind of “value judgement” on the words, but instead comparing them to the data and seeing how frequently those words appeared in the data we collected. Hopefully this helps ground this decision away from ideas of “favorite” or “best”, and more towards “most probable from the data”. However, the underlying point - that there is some kind of preference or favoritism happening - is still fair, but the real place to have that conversation is when collecting the initial data used in the app. If students want the app to make different choices, they should collect more data and see how it influences the app."
