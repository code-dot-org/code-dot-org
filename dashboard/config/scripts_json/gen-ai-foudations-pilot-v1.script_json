For example, “didn’t bat an eyelash” is a phrase meaning “not surprised”. Or combining, “bat-man” describes a certain superhero. There may be other new slang meanings that didn’t exist at the time this lesson was written that you can rely on. However, if no one suggests it, make sure to explicitly call out “bat” as a verb meaning a swatting motion like when a cat plays with toys.

It can be very easy for this to slip into the realm of “favorites” or “preferences”, where groups might argue one word is better than others for a variety of reasons. Ideally, the structure of this lesson steers away from these conversations by leaving that choice up to mathematics and probability - we aren’t making any kind of “value judgement” on the words, but instead comparing them to the data and seeing how frequently those words appeared in the data we collected. Hopefully this helps ground this decision away from ideas of “favorite” or “best”, and more towards “most probable from the data”. However, the underlying point - that there is some kind of preference or favoritism happening - is still fair, but the real place to have that conversation is when collecting the initial data used in the app. If students want the app to make different choices, they should collect more data and see how it influences the app."

Specifically, the presenters discuss how probability is the primary way language models choose which words to use next when generating output. The truth is more complicated, as discussed throughout this unit, but if looking at just the output layer: this video can be a good supplement to this lesson. The only reason it’s not included is for timing - the video is long at 7 minutes in length.

When airbags were first taken to market and installed in cars, data began to show that women were being severely injured or dying at much higher rates than men. It turns out this is because all of the testing for airbags was done by men or assuming weight and height averages associated with men - so, when folks outside this norm would drive, the airbags would cause damage that had been undetected in the tests. This scenario underscores the need to have a wide variety of users involved in the design and testing of products."
