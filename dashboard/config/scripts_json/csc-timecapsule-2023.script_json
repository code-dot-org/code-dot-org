Students will have various examples of time capsule poems to choose from, ranging from 1905-2023. Students will practice using code blocks to set a background, set text effects, create sprites with behaviors, play sounds, and trigger events to occur during certain lines of the text.",

By choosing backgrounds, text effects, sprites, and sounds you can add details that create a powerful time capsule for someone in the future. "

This can include things like pictures, letters, toys, books, and other items that are important to them.\n\nOnce everything is inside, the time capsule is buried in a special place, like a park or a school, with instructions that it should not be opened for a certain amount of time, like 10, 20, or even 50 years!\n\nThe idea is that when the time capsule is eventually opened in the future, people can learn about what life was like during the time it was created.

This lesson is designed to give students an opportunity to tinker with their code and find the visual effects that they like best. \n\nWhile circling the room, encourage students to:\n- **Take Your Time:** Most of the levels require students to find the perfect effects to match their interpretation of the mood of the time capsule poem. Staying on a level and tinkering with their code is highly encouraged.\n\n- **Show off a completed level:** Any level bubble that is fully green means the student successfully completed all the requirements for that level. Ask a student to click on a green bubble to show off what they created. \n\nFor the times when a student feels stuck: \n- **Collaborate with Neighbors:** Encourage students to check in with a neighbor when they're getting stuck. Depending on the age and ability of your students, you might consider formally breaking your class into pairs to complete the tutorial using pair programming.\n- **Read the Instructions:** The instructions are bulleted points on how to complete the level. If a student feels stuck, ask them to read the instructions out loud to you and ask them to repeat back what the instructions say in their own words. \n  - <img src=\"https://images.code.org/5b99c663ad6632fe64c9da69d6805c2b-text-to-speech.PNG\" style=\"height: 25px;\"> Students can also click on this text-to-speech icon to hear the instructions read aloud.\n- <img src=\"https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/hint.png\" style=\"height: 35px;\"> **Look for hints**: Most levels include at least one hint with more explicit details about how to pass the level. \n- **Celebrate bugs:** Getting a bug in your code is a natural part of the coding process. If the program isn’t doing what they expected, ask the student to first tell you what they want to happen, click run to observe what is actually happening, then find the place in their code that caused the discrepancy. Remember to celebrate finding bugs and fixing bugs. Getting a bug means students are doing a great job building a more complex program. "

Show students how to drag & drop the blocks. Explain that the blocks are like puzzle pieces that must fit together to run. Explain the difference between the different background block options. Show students how to use the drop down menu to select a background and a text color.\n\n**Level 5**: Students may use just the text effect and set text color blocks and have the option to change the font, highlight, and more. Explain to students the different text effect block options. Again, support time management. Consider setting a 2 minute timer when all students must move on to the next level.\n\n**Level 6**: Students may need headphones to listen to the various sound options. If there are no headphones available, remind students to use a low volume that is respectful of the other students.\n\n**Level 7**: Students will explore sprites in this level. Remind them of the meaning of this vocabulary word. Students will require continued time management support. Consider that this is about halfway through the level progression.\n\n**Level 8**: Decide whether to watch this video all together as a class or allow students to watch it independently at their computers. The skill building with events blocks shown in this Poem Art video is applicable to how students will be coding their digital time capsule poem. This is a good stopping point for students to share with a partner what they have done so far.\n\n",

No one might know to go look inside the apartment. \n\n**Plymouth Belvedere Sport Coupe**\n\nPros - A lot of people love vintage cars; this is an interesting item to preserve.

Depending on the age and ability of your students, you might consider formally breaking your class into pairs to complete the tutorial using pair programming.\n- **Read the Instructions:** The instructions are bulleted points on how to complete the level. If a student feels stuck, ask them to read the instructions out loud to you and ask them to repeat back what the instructions say in their own words. \n  - <img src=\"https://images.code.org/5b99c663ad6632fe64c9da69d6805c2b-text-to-speech.PNG\" style=\"height: 25px;\"> Students can also click on this text-to-speech icon to hear the instructions read aloud.\n- <img src=\"https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/hint.png\" style=\"height: 35px;\"> **Look for hints**: Most levels include at least one hint with more explicit details about how to pass the level. \n- **Celebrate bugs:** Getting a bug in your code is a natural part of the coding process. If the program isn’t doing what they expected, ask the student to first tell you what they want to happen, click run to observe what is actually happening, then find the place in their code that caused the discrepancy. Remember to celebrate finding bugs and fixing bugs. Getting a bug means students are doing a great job building a more complex program. "

(NOTE: Make sure students click the \"Share\" button on their project and not the link in their browser's address bar.)

Have students move \"musical chairs\"-style to another computer and play test the project there for a few minutes, until they receive a signal from you to move to another computer. Repeat this every few minutes. While there is less opportunity for structured communication here, this ensures students get to demo as many of their peers' projects as possible. As students go around the room, they should be writing a note for each classmate whose project they test out. \n"
