Students will learn the basics of Sprite Lab by coding the mood and imagery of a short poem written about a specific, important moment in time. Students will have various examples of time capsule poems to choose from, ranging from 1905-2023. Students will practice using code blocks to set a background, set text effects, create sprites with behaviors, play sounds, and trigger events to occur during certain lines of the text.",

By choosing backgrounds, text effects, sprites, and sounds you can add details that create a powerful time capsule for someone in the future. "

It can be any container sturdy enough to last a long time, like a metal box or a plastic container.\n\nPeople usually put things inside the time capsules representing their life and the world around them. This can include things like pictures, letters, toys, books, and other items that are important to them.\n\nOnce everything is inside, the time capsule is buried in a special place, like a park or a school, with instructions that it should not be opened for a certain amount of time, like 10, 20, or even 50 years!\n\nThe idea is that when the time capsule is eventually opened in the future, people can learn about what life was like during the time it was created. It's a way for people to connect with each other across time and share their experiences, hopes, and dreams.\n",

This digital time capsule can preserve your memories for much longer than a physical box could last. A digital time capsule is also easier to share with a big group of friends or family members. All you need to do is give them a link to your project. \n\nIn your digital time capsule, you will write a short time capsule poem and you can choose pictures, animations, music, and sound effects that represent your life right now.\n\nThen, you can set a date in the future for when you want your time capsule to be opened. It could be next year, in five years, or even twenty years from now!\n\nWhen the time comes, people will be able to see what your life was like back then, and it will be like a window into the past. It's a fun way to preserve memories and share them with others!\n\nLet’s look at an example of a **<a href=\"https://studio.code.org/projects/poetry_hoc/vWM8NbLtagEc3DVX_kzkjgr8gYS-W8kuaxJ_TjOfQHw\" target=\"_blank\">Time Capsule</a>**.

This lesson is designed to give students an opportunity to tinker with their code and find the visual effects that they like best. \n\nWhile circling the room, encourage students to:\n- **Take Your Time:** Most of the levels require students to find the perfect effects to match their interpretation of the mood of the time capsule poem. Staying on a level and tinkering with their code is highly encouraged.\n\n- **Show off a completed level:** Any level bubble that is fully green means the student successfully completed all the requirements for that level. Ask a student to click on a green bubble to show off what they created. \n\nFor the times when a student feels stuck: \n- **Collaborate with Neighbors:** Encourage students to check in with a neighbor when they're getting stuck. Depending on the age and ability of your students, you might consider formally breaking your class into pairs to complete the tutorial using pair programming.\n- **Read the Instructions:** The instructions are bulleted points on how to complete the level. If a student feels stuck, ask them to read the instructions out loud to you and ask them to repeat back what the instructions say in their own words. \n  - <img src=\"https://images.code.org/5b99c663ad6632fe64c9da69d6805c2b-text-to-speech.PNG\" style=\"height: 25px;\"> Students can also click on this text-to-speech icon to hear the instructions read aloud.\n- <img src=\"https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/hint.png\" style=\"height: 35px;\"> **Look for hints**: Most levels include at least one hint with more explicit details about how to pass the level. \n- **Celebrate bugs:** Getting a bug in your code is a natural part of the coding process. If the program isn’t doing what they expected, ask the student to first tell you what they want to happen, click run to observe what is actually happening, then find the place in their code that caused the discrepancy. Remember to celebrate finding bugs and fixing bugs. Getting a bug means students are doing a great job building a more complex program. "

You don’t know when someone will find it; it is hard to predict when the bottle would wash up on shore again. \n\n**Paris Apartment**\n\nPros - This time capsule was able to show a lot of what life was like; it is a house full of preserved items. The items were all kept safe from damage because they were kept indoors.\n\nCons - It costs a lot of money to rent an apartment for 70 years. No one might know to go look inside the apartment. \n\n**Plymouth Belvedere Sport Coupe**\n\nPros - A lot of people love vintage cars; this is an interesting item to preserve. It would be interesting to compare old cars to cars today.\n\nCons - This time capsule was completely ruined by water. It hasn’t been possible to restore it and museums don’t even want to show it because of too much water damage.\n\n**Space Time Capsule**\n\nPros - They used images to communicate with someone in any language. They used strong materials so that it could withstand traveling through space.\n\nCons - It is unknown whether anyone will ever receive this time capsule.\n"

Depending on the age and ability of your students, you might consider formally breaking your class into pairs to complete the tutorial using pair programming.\n- **Read the Instructions:** The instructions are bulleted points on how to complete the level. If a student feels stuck, ask them to read the instructions out loud to you and ask them to repeat back what the instructions say in their own words. \n  - <img src=\"https://images.code.org/5b99c663ad6632fe64c9da69d6805c2b-text-to-speech.PNG\" style=\"height: 25px;\"> Students can also click on this text-to-speech icon to hear the instructions read aloud.\n- <img src=\"https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/hint.png\" style=\"height: 35px;\"> **Look for hints**: Most levels include at least one hint with more explicit details about how to pass the level. \n- **Celebrate bugs:** Getting a bug in your code is a natural part of the coding process. If the program isn’t doing what they expected, ask the student to first tell you what they want to happen, click run to observe what is actually happening, then find the place in their code that caused the discrepancy. Remember to celebrate finding bugs and fixing bugs. Getting a bug means students are doing a great job building a more complex program. "
