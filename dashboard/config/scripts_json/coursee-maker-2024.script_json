Does anyone have a favorite dance move?*\n\t- *Have you ever watched a dance team perform to music together? How do they stay in sync?*\n\t\t- *One way to do this might be to plan out all of the moves in advance. It's almost like the dancers are programmed! Computer scientists would call this an algorithm because it's a list of steps to get something done.*\n\t\t- *Another way to keep in sync is to have a cue that tells everyone when to change to a different move. Everyone would still need to know what moves to perform and agree on what the cues mean.*\n\t- *If I want everyone in class to clap at the exact same time, I could do that by giving you a countdown from 3.* (Try it!) \n\t- *When I reached \"1\", that was the event that gave you all the signal to clap.*\n- Ask the class if they can think of any other events that could give signals.\n\t- You may need to remind them that you're not talking about an event like a birthday party or a field trip.\n\t- If they have trouble, you can remind them that an event is an action that causes something to happen.\n\t\t- Blowing a whistle\n\t\t- Waving a flag\n\t\t- Saying a magic word\n\t\t- Pressing a button\n- *Today, we're going to organize our class dance party using events.*",

To solve this puzzle, place a `set size` block anywhere in your program and use it to change the size of some of your dancers. \n* Dancers created as a group have a default size of 30. Other dancers have a default size of 100.\n\n##### Level 12\n\n* As with the previous level, make sure to only use the `set tint to (color)` block after you have made the dancers in your program. For example, placing it as the first step in the `setup` area of your program will have no effect.\n\n##### Level 13\n\n* With the right code, you should see the dancer cycle through different colors, sizes, or dance moves.\n* Make sure there is a teal `change`, a teal `randomize` block, or a purple `do forever` block connected inside the `every 2 measures` block. \n* Make sure `do forever` blocks are set to either (Next), (Previous), or (Random). Otherwise, the dancer will just perform the set move repeatedly.\n* Note that the **code students write in this level is not checked for correctness**. This means they will always pass the level, even if they do not change the program. Students should feel free to experiment with their code in ways that are interesting to them. Click the “Finish” button to move on.\n* Making new dancers inside the `every 2 measures` block will cause your program to create multiple identical dancers at the same location(s) and may lead to unintended consequences!\n",

He especially likes playing sports games with his friends.\n* Things have been hard for Roger lately, though. A few years ago, Roger’s hand had to be “amputated” (surgically removed) due to an accident. \n* Thankfully, computer scientists, engineers, and doctors are working hard to provide Roger with a cool-looking robotic “prosthetic hand,” which will be awesome!\n* But for now, Roger wants to play sports video games with his friends! \n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display:** Show \"Introducing Football Frenzy!\" slide\n\n* Football Frenzy is a new mobile game that everyone loves!\n* It has cool graphics, awesome sound effects, tight controls, and amazing action!\n\n**Discuss**: What do you think about this app?

Students can design as many screens for the app as they wish, and they do not need to make their app look anything like the original examples.\n\nIf there is time, students may redesign apps for both characters.\n\n**Distribute**: Pass out crayons/pencils/etc. to each student as they open their reflection journals. \n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: “Share Out” slide\n\n**Share**: After designing, students share their app design with a neighbor, or if there is time, some students can share with the whole class.

(Three additional slides have been provided for this part of the activity if needed.)\n\n\n\n\nOnce the class has had some practice, you can encourage students to nest conditionals inside one another. Make sure they understand that if the card is red, YOUR team is awarded 1 point, and then _nothing else happens_, since the condition was met:\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: Show \"Let's nest conditionals” slide\n\n\n\n\tIf (CARD is RED)\n\t\tAward YOUR team 1 point\n\t\n\tElse\n\t\tIf (CARD is higher than 9)\n\t\t\tAward OTHER team 1 point\n\t\tElse\n\t\t\tAward YOUR team the same number of points on the card\n\n\n\nHere is the same program in pseudocode:\n\n\tIf (card.color == RED ){\n\t\tpoints.yours = points.yours + 1;\n\t}\n\tElse {\n\t\tif (card.value > 9){\n\t\t\tpoints.other = points.other + 1;\n\t\t}\n\t\tElse {\n\t\t\tpoints.yours = points.yours + card.value;\n\t\t}\n\t}"

All of a sudden, our chorus would be a function of repeated actions, rather than words.\r\n- Use the concepts of the arrows from the Graph Paper Programming lesson and create a program with lots of repeating instructions.\r\n\t- Circle those repeating actions so that the class can see where they are.\r\n\t- Define a function called \"Chorus\" above the program.\r\n\t- Cross out everywhere the repeating actions appear in the program and write \"Chorus\" instead.\r\n- Repeat until the class can go through this process with little direction."

In a function declaration, you fill in the function with code and you give the function a name. You must declare a function before you can use it.\n\n2. **The Call**:\n\tFunction calls are what makes the program run the code in the function. To call a function, you place the name of the function in your program. Make sure your function is properly defined before calling it in your program.\n    \nThe class can use songwriting as an example to understand these two components. In the unplugged activity, the function containing the lyrics to the chorus was named \"chorus\". When we first made this function, we circled the lyrics that would go in the function. Once we named the function, we could read through the lyrics and replace the repeated chorus lyrics with a function call to \"chorus\".\n\nContinue the conversation until students have a basic understanding of functions being declared and called. If students don't get to this point, make sure to do one of the bridging activities before moving into the Code.org puzzles."
