        "description": "> <i class=\"fa fa-microphone\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Say:** Today marks the beginning of our explorations with computer vision. We’re going to peel back the curtain and see how computers use images & video to “see” the world around them, turning pixels into patterns, and patterns into predictions. It’s a field of study that is ongoing, current, and with many applications now and in the near future that promise to change the way that society looks and functions.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-comments\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discuss:** _How might we create an algorithm so that a computer can see the difference between \"X\" and \"O\"?_\n\n**Discussion Goal:** A simple algorithm that students might come up with is to test whether the corners are filled in; if so, then it must be an X. They might also suggest to test to see if the lines present cross each other. Encourage students to come up with as many rules / steps as they are able to in the amount of time given. Teaching Tip Consider having students talk to a shoulder partner for a minute or two to discuss and work out an algorithm before beginning a whole class discussion.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-comments\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discuss:** _Does your algorithm work for the examples of an \"X\" seen here? Why or why not?_\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-lightbulb-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discussion Goal:** No matter how detailed the algorithm was that students created previously, it is highly likely that it didn’t account for some variation of the 'X' seen here. And even if it did, it was also likely that there could be an 'X' drawn that did not account for the algorithm. Traditional algorithmic thinking has specific conditions to check for, but even in an example as small as this 9x9 grid, we can see that it is difficult, if not impossible, to account for all of the variations. It is important to point out that one of the main goals of computer vision technologies is to be able to train computers to recognize an 'X'-- in addition to other objects– in new and novel implementations.\n\n> <i class=\"fa fa-microphone\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Say:** Throughout this module we will be learning how computer scientists are developing sophisticated computer vision algorithms utilizing AI and data. By training these models with loads of data, the computer itself begins to write and tweak its own algorithms to help it decode and understand what an \"X\" might be. Even if it sees a version that it has never seen before, if the training was thorough enough, it should be able to recognize the letter. That is one of the goals of computer vision: to train computers to see and interpret the world around them just like we are able to do as human beings.\n\n> <i class=\"fa fa-microphone\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Say:** Let’s take a look at an introductory video that details the basics of what computer vision is, how it differs from traditional programming / algorithm development, and what some uses might be.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-video-camera\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Video:** How AI Works: Computer Vision (2:24 to 3:46)\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-comments\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discuss:** _When teaching a computer to \"see\", how does machine learning differ from traditional programming?_\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-lightbulb-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discussion Goal:** With traditional programming, we often hard-code in certain assumptions and conditions– like it might be an X shape if the center pixel filled in. However, that doesn’t account for situations where the X shape is askew or transformed across the canvas. Machine learning allows a computer to use data to develop an algorithm for itself. The more data that the computer has, the more accurate the guess that it can make becomes. Machine learning finds patterns by learning from its mistakes.",

To start the process, we need to figure out who we are designing for, which involves finding a community with a need. To help with this, we are all going to brainstorm a list of communities that we belong to in our Unit Guides. Here is an example of how this brainstorm might look:\n\n<img src=\"https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png\" /> Click the animation\n\n> <i class=\"fa fa-microphone\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Say:** These can be general communities related to characteristics such as age…\n\n<img src=\"https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png\" /> Click the animation\n\n> <i class=\"fa fa-microphone\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Say:** Interests…\n\n<img src=\"https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png\" /> Click the animation\n\n> <i class=\"fa fa-microphone\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Say:** Location…\n\n<img src=\"https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png\" /> Click the animation\n\n> <i class=\"fa fa-microphone\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Say:** Pets…\n\n<img src=\"https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png\" /> Click the animation\n\n> <i class=\"fa fa-microphone\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Say:** Or any number of other characteristics.

Use the musical cue on the slides to facilitate the timing of students walking around the room to share responses with each other.\n\n> <i class=\"fa fa-microphone\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Say:** Next, we are going to practice turning observations about problems facing a community into questions that will allow us to gather more information about our users’ needs. For this, let’s return to the example of FarmWise employees volunteering on farms and interviewing farmers.\n>\n> We already discussed some things that the FarmWise employees might have learned from their interviews. Let’s break down the process of gathering that information a little bit more, starting with some observations that the designers might have made while volunteering as a part of the farming community: Lack of access to enough water Trouble finding enough workers to hire Challenges minimizing the loss of crops due to pests and disease.\n>\n> These problems and the needs associated with them might be obvious to members of the community, but as designers, our job is to find out more about what our users need instead of making assumptions. To do this, we need to dig a bit deeper by talking with users, just like the FarmWise employees interviewed farmers.\n>\n> Turning these observations into research questions will help you as a designer gather more data about your users and help you more clearly define the problem you are trying to solve.\n>\n> Here is an example of a question that the employees at FarmWise might have asked to learn more about the issue of water scarcity. Can you think of questions they might ask about labor shortages or pest and disease management?\n\n<img src=\"https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png\" /> Click the animation\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-check-square-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Do This:** Give students a minute to process and brainstorm possible questions before asking a few students to share possible questions.",

Histograms and line graphs are often the easiest visualizations to create for students. Introduce the Customize menu in the Chart Editor – this allows them to have better control over the labels, looks, and presentation of their data. Encourage the students to try different chart types within the Editor, seeing which one best fits their data. Creating visualizations for qualitative data in Sheets is difficult! Ways that students could overcome this challenge would be to look at the most important words in the data and to keep track of the frequency with which these words appear. With the data presented in that fashion, a histogram could be created that would highlight the most used terms, and thus, indicate what might be most important to users. \\[Advanced] Formulas such as =SUM() and =AVERAGE() can be used to aggregate data.",

Some examples that students might share include: Payments and Transactions Event Tickets and Boarding Passes Restaurant Menus Public Transport Educational Resources and Libraries Product Information and Reviews Social Media Augmented Reality Experiences\n\nGroup: Place students in pairs or small groups of 3.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-comments\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discuss:** _What patterns repeat across the cards and what purpose do they serve?_\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-lightbulb-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discussion Goal:** It is likely that most students have seen QR Codes before, but they are now being asked to compare and find patterns that exist between all of the samples that they are shown. The first pattern that they may see is the bullseye-looking one in the upper left/right and bottom left corners. These are called Position Markers. Students might realize that they are there to help align the image when it is scanned so that the scanner knows which end is up and which end is down. On the larger QR Codes, they might also see smaller bullseye patterns repeating at regular intervals. These are designed to help the QR Code scanner normalize an image – that is, correct is perspective if the camera takes an image at an angle and warps the QR square.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-comments\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discuss:** _How do you think QR codes store information?_\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-lightbulb-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discussion Goal:** Discuss the structure of QR codes, including the black and white squares, and how these patterns translate into digital data that can be read by a scanner or smartphone camera. Since there are only filled and non-filled squares, make a connection to the Warm-up in which you discussed bits (binary digits). The squares could represent 1s or 0s if they are filled or not filled. Some students might point out that you need set an order in which to “read” the bits of data, otherwise any binary message that is contained in the QR Code would get scrambled. Therefore, it is important to agree to a set of rules that helps us to encode and decode the bits in a certain order.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-video-camera\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Video:** Show the video \"How do QR Codes Work: Explained in Minutes\"\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-comments\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discuss:** _What surprises you about how QR codes work?_\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-lightbulb-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discussion Goal:** Students highlight different aspects of QR codes that surprised them, such as the different elements, error correction, or how it encodes data.",

Some of the more important ones to discuss and point out are as follows: Looking for Changes in Brightness– edges are often delineated visually, and examining the underlying brightness of pixels might be important From this discussion point, students might ponder which color they should investigate since there are red, green, and blue values in each pixel. This is a good point and we will circle back around to this when students look to revise their algorithms. Students might also point out that differences in brightness might occur horizontally or vertically. Set a threshold value– if a pixel’s value is below (or above) the threshold value, then it is discarded. In this way, we can begin to segment or slice up an image. Finding a good threshold value might be a challenge. Use a grid to overlay the image so that you are focused on a small space at a time.\n\n> <i class=\"fa fa-microphone\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Say:** Now let’s see if we can figure out a way to try to make our algorithm run more efficiently, so that we can perform our edge detection on lots of images (or even video) almost instantaneously. As before, there are hint cards that are available if you get stuck and need some guidance.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-check-square-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Do This:** Direct students to modify their algorithm to make it more efficient.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-refresh\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Circulate:** Spend some time with each group listening to their conversations about proposed efficiencies. Encourage the students to use the Efficiency Hint Cards that you set up to give them a nudge towards a concept to explore.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-comments\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discuss:** _What were some of the revisions that you made to your algorithm?_\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-lightbulb-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discussion Goal:** There will be many possible student responses made here, but the two most important to bring up in discussion would be the following: Sample the image - rather than looking at a high resolution image, we can sample pixels to reconstruct a smaller version of the image. This greatly boosts performance of filtering algorithms. Reduce the color values - we learned that all pixels contain at least a red, green, and blue value (some also include an alpha, or transparency value). We can average the three values together to form one number which will display as grayscale (0 - black / 255 - white / all other values - shades of gray).\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-comments\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discuss:** _To increase the processing speed of your algorithm, was there a compromise that needed to be made elsewhere?_\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-lightbulb-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discussion Goal:** An important point here is that introducing efficiencies often means reducing the fidelity of the image in some way. In the two examples referenced above, sampling an image permanently gets rid of lots of pixels within an image, and while we can infer what those might be, it is impossible to recover that data. This is similar to working with color. When we convert an image to grayscale, we lose the unique color values that are present in the pixels.\n\n> <i class=\"fa fa-microphone\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Say:** Imagine you have a huge, detailed wall mural, and you want to recreate a smaller version of it on a piece of paper. You can't capture every single detail because your paper is much smaller, so you decide to pick just the most important bits to draw.\n>\n> When we take digital pictures or videos, we're capturing a vast amount of visual information. But sometimes, we need to reduce the size of these images for various reasons—maybe to save space on our phones, or to make websites load faster online. When we do this, we're faced with a challenge similar to shrinking our mural: we need to decide which details are crucial to keep and which ones we can leave out.\n\n> <i class=\"fa fa-microphone\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Say:** We are continuing our work from the previous lesson with the Ideate stage. As you brainstorm today, discuss if edge detection filtering might be necessary for your computer vision application.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-check-square-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Do This:** Direct students to continue brainstorming ideas for their project."

It is important to point out that there are many different ways of grouping the images – it could be based on similar objects that are detected in the scene (e.g. cooking utensils), on location (e.g. inside of a school), on attributes (e.g. clean vs. dirty / color palette), or context (e.g. it must be lunch time!). An important takeaway is that while there are many ways to group, sort, and label images, the most important consideration is the purpose behind what you are grouping. If we want a dataset that will help a computer vision application to identify objects in a scene, for instance, then labeling and classifying by object type would be the ideal way to group these images.\n\nAnother important conversation thread that could emerge is that it is often difficult (if not impossible!) to sort the images based on a singular object. If you made two categories- books and tables- there are images that contain one or the other, but also images that contain both. Therefore, being able to tag multiple objects within an image becomes important.\n\n> <i class=\"fa fa-microphone\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Say:** Having access to datasets full of thousands or millions of images that are sorted and labelled with information is absolutely essential in being able to train a computer vision system to interpret the world around us."

They will learn next that the percentage represents a confidence rating that the model has with its own guess. The higher the number, the higher its confidence that it is correct in inferring the object. The max results toggle. This allows the model to put more predictions on the screen at once.

Let's imagine you are trying to teach a friend to recognize something they’ve never seen before. But, there’s a catch - you can only use images!

Each perspective offers unique information about the subject. These drawings range from a frontal view to a side view, and back perspectives. We could have even had a top-down view or a zoomed in view as well. Notice how each view captures different details? Think about why this diversity in data would be crucial for training algorithms to recognize objects.\n\n> <i class=\"fa fa-microphone\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Say:** It is now your turn to train your classmates!

They could wonder if the Teachable Machine retains the information from their session for the next time it's used. Can it learn to recognize me? Some students might be intrigued by the possibility of the machine learning to recognize them personally or specific gestures they make. How does it know what it's seeing so fast?

Ask the student to reflect on any aspect of their project that required even minor adjustments or where they faced challenges, even if those challenges didn't lead to drastic changes.

Now, let's introduce a twist to truly test the flexibility of your design thinking. You will now receive a new constraint for your object. This constraint represents unexpected feedback or a challenge that your design must now accommodate. Remember, great innovations often come from overcoming unexpected hurdles. Let's see how you can adapt your original ideas to meet these new conditions. Embrace this challenge as an opportunity to think outside the box and further refine your designs.\n\n<img src=\"https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png\" /> Click the animation to reveal each object’s constraint one at a time\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-check-square-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Do This:** Introduce the list of constraints to simulate receiving new user feedback one at a time.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-refresh\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Circulate:** Ensure all students are participating and that groups are considering the usability and practicality of their designs in light of the introduced constraints.",
