Instead of the one or two word description from the pre-generated design elements, students will use the same questions they saw in the survey.\n- **Level 4:** Students will choose a theme to update the design of their app. For now, just have them choose a theme. Later on, they can continue to customize their app with Design Mode\n- **Level 5:** Students add a home screen to their app. The instructions for this level may be difficult to keep track of - encourage students to “check off” each step as they complete it. They can also use the animated example on the level as a guide for how to complete this task.\n- **Level 6:** Students add a button from the home screen to the predict screen, and add an event to connect the two screens together. Support students in reading through the instructions and “checking off” each piece as they go along. They can also click the “Show Me How” lines in the instructions for screenshots of what each step can look like."

Here are some things to be on the lookout for as students work:\n\n- **Level 4:** Students practice deleting the default elements that are generated when you first import a model. This is a step that will be important when students create their own custom apps in later projects.\n- **Level 5 and 6:** Students are only updating the code of their app to use the new design elements for the Number of Cars and Weather features. They can use the hints within the level instructions for clues on what to do in each step.\n- **Level 7:** Students update both the design and the code of their app to collect data for the Temperature feature. Help students keep track of the new text input element they add to the temperature screen, and make sure the ID of the element matches the one they use in the [`getText`(#fff176)](/docs/applab/getText/) block of their code.\n- **Level 8:** Students update both the design and the code of their app to collect data for the Time of Day feature. Adding the design element and updating the code is similar to the last level, but this step has the added requirement of using the Model Card to check the possible values are for this categorical feature.

Students might suggest that Zoey collects more data before trying to train her model again.\n- **Isaac’s Data:** Isaac’s models will always be low because none of his features have a strong relationship to his label - students should notice that none of the Cross Tab charts have strong hot spots with any question. If students look at the questions themselves, they may notice that they don’t seem to have a strong relationship to the label Isaac is trying to predict. Students may recommend Isaac choose different questions and collecting his data again.\n- **Kim’s Data:** Kim’s models can be very accurate, but when students test the model they may find the questions and answer choices very specific and not inclusive - for example, the “favorite lunch food” question only contains meat options. Students may suggest that, even though the model is accurate, Kim may want to choose different questions that are more broad and inclusive rather than so specific.\n- **Nico’s Data:** Nico’s models can be very accurate, but when students test the model they may find that the majority of the recommendation is for the “Band Club” no matter what they pick. Students may need some prompting to notice this, but the data selection screen shows that Nico collected data primarily from people in a band, which biased his model towards recommending the Band club. Students may recommend Nico can avoid this next time by making sure he has a wide variety of people complete his survey."

There are a few options available for students who encounter this:\n\n- If a dataset is _close_ to a student’s initial idea, encourage them to adjust their app idea to match the data available. This happens frequently when developing machine learning apps as well since the apps can only work with the data that is available\n- If students find a dataset that looks interesting but is unrelated to their topic, encourage them to adjust their app idea to use the new dataset. They will need to re-complete Part 1 of the Project Guide, but the rest of the activity can continue as normal using the new dataset\n- If students have picked a highly relevant topic but there aren’t any supporting datasets, students have the following options:\n\t- You can help students use a program like Google Forms to collect their own data to create a Machine Learning model. [Click Here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Yzoug2iW-_GUWrQJo4jIlfuKNtelVNrer1PvT4rXF7w/copy) to make a copy of a form that students can use as a template. Once students have collected enough data, they can export their data as a .csv file and upload it to AI Lab. [Click Here](https://www.loom.com/share/243208cbfb1e427c81fc7d2bac43f1e9) for a video showing how you and students can use this form with AI Lab\n\t- You can help students search for new datasets using a Machine Learning dataset website like [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/). This site can be overwhelming and not all of the datasets will work with AI Lab, so students will need guidance on how to find appropriate datasets\n"

This solution attempts to address Thuy’s needs by suggesting how much time she should study for tests. However, this solution assumes Thuy’s only problem is tests when it might also be homework.\r\n- **Feasibility:** For this solution to be realistic, we need to make sure the dataset reflects a wide range of students and their study habits. Of course, students like Thuy should be represented in the dataset too. \r\n- **Use of AI:** This solution uses AI to predict the number of hours Thuy will need to study to pass a test. Without AI, the solution might predict randomly or otherwise use some other method that isn’t based on students’ study data. While this might make things more complex in the short-run (since we need to obtain and analyze data), the app should be smarter in the long run. \r\n- **Scalability:** This solution should work for any student in a situation similar to Thuy’s. However, as we mentioned with impact, some students might be doing well with tests but failing with other things like homework, so this solution will not work well for them. \r\n- **Responsibility:** If the model behind this solution is inaccurate, Thuy might under-study and fail tests. Additionally, there might be privacy concerns, depending on how we collect students’ study data (it should be anonymous)."
