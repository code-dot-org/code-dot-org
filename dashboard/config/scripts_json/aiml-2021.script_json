Students should be using the cross-tab visualizations to make decisions about which features are useful for making recommendations, noticing when features have strong relationships and when features appear “random”. Help students see that choosing all the features or choosing features at random isn’t useful if it leads to an inaccurate model.\n\n**Order Matters**: Students may discover that the order they select their features can sometimes matter - for example, choosing \"peppers, fried chicken\" may end up with different accuracy than \"fried chicken, peppers\". This is not a vital topic for using AI Lab fluently, and happens more often in these early levels because of the smaller dataset sizes. If students ask, one way to think about it is that the first feature represents how AI Bot first tries to separate the data before continuing on to the other features. Therefore: the stronger the relationship is with the first feature you pick, the stronger the patterns AI Bot will find."

Instead of the one or two word description from the pre-generated design elements, students will use the same questions they saw in the survey.\n- **Level 4:** Students will choose a theme to update the design of their app. For now, just have them choose a theme. Later on, they can continue to customize their app with Design Mode\n- **Level 5:** Students add a home screen to their app. The instructions for this level may be difficult to keep track of - encourage students to “check off” each step as they complete it. They can also use the animated example on the level as a guide for how to complete this task.\n- **Level 6:** Students add a button from the home screen to the predict screen, and add an event to connect the two screens together. Support students in reading through the instructions and “checking off” each piece as they go along. They can also click the “Show Me How” lines in the instructions for screenshots of what each step can look like.",

Examples of this can be seen in the [ProPublica Breaking the Black Box](https://www.propublica.org/article/breaking-the-black-box-when-algorithms-decide-what-you-pay) journalism series. This is a 4-part series that includes short videos and additional resources about different investigations into machine learning algorithms. One of the videos on pricing calls out how online products can have different prices depending on the zip code of the user, which is a common issue involving bias in machine learning models where a zip code can be used as a proxy for race or socio-economic status.\n\nThese videos aren't intended for classroom use, but you may decide to share some of these videos with students to continue conversations around bias in machine learning and the need for transparency via Model Cards."

Students may find themselves starting to move fluently between the testing, feature, and label screens as they refine and improve their machine learning model.\n\n**Level 2 - Where Are The Tables?** In level 2, students predict the type of animal that they are looking at (like mammal, reptile, etc). This column has too many possible values, and so many data visualization tables won't appear. This is intentional, since it challenges students to use feature iteration and the Previous Results screens intentionally to find features that work. They need to trust that, if there are patterns in the data, AI Bot will find them and produce an accurate model even when there's too much data to visualize. This also prepares students for more realistic examples where there are typically more than 4 or 5 values for a feature."

This is a step that will be important when students create their own custom apps in later projects.\n- **Level 4 and 5:** Students are only updating the code of their app to use the new design elements for the Number of Cars and Weather features. They can use the hints within the level instructions for clues on what to do in each step.\n- **Level 6:** Students update both the design and the code of their app to collect data for the Temperature feature. Help students keep track of the new text input element they add to the temperature screen, and make sure the ID of the element matches the one they use in the [`getText`(#fff176)](/docs/applab/getText/) block of their code.\n- **Level 7:** Students update both the design and the code of their app to collect data for the Time of Day feature. Adding the design element and updating the code is similar to the last level, but this step has the added requirement of using the Model Card to check the possible values are for this categorical feature. Students may make spelling or capitalization errors that can effect their code - encourage students to be very careful to match their dropdown options exactly with the model card.\n- **Level 8:** Students have a chance to run their app and verify that it works.

After adding these new design mode elements, students will need to update their code to use the new elements as well. Students can refer to [Lesson 13](../11), especially level 1, as an example of how to update their code to fix this problem.\n\n**Strategy #2: Reposition Elements.** Even though the elements are off the screen, you can use Design Mode to manually select them and re-position them so they are on the screen.

These three apps could all use machine learning.\n- Kim's App requires users to interact, but it doesn't use any of their data to make decisions. This isn't a good machine learning app.\n- Zoey's app might require some data to create the app and generate the icebreakers, but it doesn't require any information from the user once it's being used.

Students might suggest that Zoey collects more data before trying to train her model again.\n- **Isaac’s Data:** Isaac’s models will always be low because none of his features have a strong relationship to his label - students should notice that none of the Cross Tab charts have strong hot spots with any question. If students look at the questions themselves, they may notice that they don’t seem to have a strong relationship to the label Isaac is trying to predict. Students may recommend Isaac choose different questions and collecting his data again.\n- **Kim’s Data:** Kim’s models can be very accurate, but when students test the model they may find the questions and answer choices very specific and not inclusive - for example, the “favorite lunch food” question only contains meat options. Students may suggest that, even though the model is accurate, Kim may want to choose different questions that are more broad and inclusive rather than so specific.\n- **Nico’s Data:** Nico’s models can be very accurate, but when students test the model they may find that the majority of the recommendation is for the “Band Club” no matter what they pick. Students may need some prompting to notice this, but the data selection screen shows that Nico collected data primarily from people in a band, which biased his model towards recommending the Band club. Students may recommend Nico can avoid this next time by making sure he has a wide variety of people complete his survey."

There are a variety of factors that could make this difficult, especially if students didn't have a chance to collect enough data or the data doesn't lead to accurate models. Here are some strategies to help students move past these issues:\n\n- **Documenting in the Model Card**: Even if the data doesn't appear to create an accurate model, students can still use this data to complete the project as long as they document their decisions in the Model Card, especially in the Limitations section. Even though this means they are creating an app without an accurate model, it provides an opportunity for reflection on what could have gone differently in a future project.\n- **Use a pre-supplied dataset:** Several datasets are available in AI Lab for students to use if their survey data isn't leading to fruitful results. Students can use one of these datasets instead to complete their project. This may require adjusting the focus of their app, but students will at least be able to complete the project\n- **Exploring Advanced Datasets:** AI Lab is designed to work with machine learning datasets from several common websites, such as [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). Students can explore this website to find a dataset that fits their needs, then use the dataset in AI Lab to train their model. An account is required to download datasets - we recommend having a teacher create an account and manage downloading datasets for students.\n\nIn general, this project focuses on students' ability to plan and execute an AI app that addresses an issue they care about, from ideation to data collection to app creation. Completing this cycle is ultimately more important than having an accurate app, especially since students have previously completed the mini-project which focuses more on training an accurate model and since students can document the intended uses and limitations on a Model Card."
