        "description": "### Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy\n\n\n* **Intro to EIPM:** This unit is students' first experience with the Explore, Investigate, Practice, Make lesson sequence, or EIPM. This structured approach to teaching programming is covered in detail in the curriculum guide. We highly recommend watching the [accompanying video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNeqEl6MN7c2KyM3gdBSo8t3) to better understand what EIPM should look like in the classroom. When used effectively, it supports deep learning of content and helps maintain a collaborative classroom culture, even as you move into more complex programming concepts.\n\n* **Scaffolding Towards Independent Projects:** A major goal of this course is to empower students to design and build projects independently. The Create PT in Unit 8 offers students enormous freedom to scope and build projects, and even this unit begins scaffolding towards that goal. Individual EIPM sequences of lessons gradually prepare students for scoped, independent Make projects. The unit project has a few requirements, but students are largely free to choose the design, topic, and implementation of their ideas. As you teach the unit, look for the opportunities to scaffold the skills and knowledge students will need to creatively and independently tackle the unit project.\n\n\n### Major Assessment and Projects\n\nThe unit project asks students to design an app that makes a recommendation based on information from user input. Students are given a great deal of freedom to choose their topic, design their user interface, and decide how to actually program their app's behavior. Students submit their app, project guide, and written responses to reflection questions about how the app is designed and the development process they used to make it. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n\n### AP Connections\n\nThis unit and unit project helps build towards the enduring understandings listed below. For a detailed mapping of units to Learning Objectives and EKs, please see the \"Standards\" page for this unit.\n\n* CRD-2: Developers create and innovate using an iterative design process that is user-focused, that incorporates implementation/feedback cycles, and that leaves ample room for experimentation and risk-taking.\n* AAP-1: To find specific solutions to generalizable problems, programmers represent and organize data in multiple ways.\n* AAP-2: The way statements are sequenced and combined in a program determines the computed result. Programs incorporate iteration and selection constructs to represent repetition and make decisions to handle varied input values.\n* AAP-3: Programmers break down problems into smaller and more manageable pieces. By creating procedures and leveraging parameters, programmers generalize processes that can be reused. Procedures allow programmers to draw upon existing code that has already been tested, allowing them to write programs more quickly and with more confidence.\n\nThis unit includes content from the following topics from the AP CS Principles Framework. For more detailed information on topic coverage in the course review [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dqYF5u0AULjw049gaCwAP34ZSe0VuEWbAjWoH1-YMW0/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n* 1.4 Identifying and Correcting Errors\n* 3.1 Variables and Assignment\n* 3.3 Mathematical Expressions\n* 3.5 Boolean Expressions\n* 3.6 Conditionals\n* 3.7 Nested Conditionals\n* 3.15 Random Values\n\nThe College Board has supplied formative Create PT questions to help prepare students to complete the Create Task. We recommend that students complete the following prompts with the unit project. More information can be found in Code.org CS Principles Topic Coverage.\n\n* 3.a.i.\n* 3.a.ii.\n* 3.a.iii"

The model is typically that a term or concept is introduced and modeled and then afterwards students are encouraged to try it out on their own. Trying it out typically means they are writing information on a sticky note and sharing it with another group before discussing the results with the whole class.\r\n\r\nSlides with animations have an icon in the bottom left corner to let you know you need to click to reveal more of the slide's content. \r\n\r\nTo help you more easily prepare the activity and keep track of your instructions, detailed instructions have been included as speaker notes in the presentation. Here are some tips to help you throughout the presentation.\r\n\r\n* There are opportunities throughout the presentation for students to actively engage. At these moments students should be making things with their manipulatives or using them to answer questions. Use these opportunities to check progress.\r\n* There is a fair amount of new vocabulary introduced but it is introduced gradually and with intentional repetition. Make a point of actively modeling the use of new terms.\r\n* The most important goal here is building a mental model. It is ok if students have some open questions that will get resolved over the subsequent conditional lessons.\r\n* Both you and students can use the \"Key Takeaways\" to check your understanding at the end."

We're going to call one \"piece\" of information a \"value\". Right now there are two different types of values: numbers and strings. There are a few ways to tell them apart. Numbers work the way you normally think of numbers. They are made of the digits 0 through 9. We are going to put numbers on yellow sticky notes. When we write numbers you don't need quotes. Strings are made of any characters you can see on the keyboard which means all these examples count as strings. Strings go inside double quotes. You can see how it would be important to tell the number 123 apart from the string \"123\".  <br><br> **Do This:** Make one string and one number and hold it up at your table. |\n|![](https://images.code.org/cfa94f5d1dbe63a048fc36a273cdd86e-CSPVariables3.svg.png) | **Say:** Operator is just a fancy name for the plus, minus, multiply, and divide symbols. An expression is a combination of two sticky notes and an operator. When I ask you \"what's 2 plus 3\" you say \"5\"! You just \"evaluated\" the expression 2+3, or figure out what the value is. Since 5 is a number, we put it on a yellow sticky. When evaluating an expression, we follow order of operations - just like in math class. <br><br> **Do This:** Evaluate the expression 5-1 and make a sticky note. Make sure you pick the correct color and decide if you need quotes or not!   |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSPVariables4.svg) | **Say:** This table shows the different ways we can create expressions. We can use all four operators with numbers the normal way. When you want to use strings, you can only use the + operator and it connects the two words together. If you're connecting a number and a string, the number first gets converted to a string. <br><br> **Do This:** With your partner make a sticky note for each of these 5 expressions and we'll share as a class. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation:** Click through to see the answers. |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSPVariables5.svg) | **Say:** We're going to call the plastic baggies on your table \"variables\". Variables can hold at most one value, or sticky note. They have names that use no quotes, include no spaces, and must start with a letter. For now just practice making a variable with your partner. <br><br> **Do This:** Make one variable with any name you like. Share it with another group. Make sure you use a whiteboard marker so we can reuse the baggies later.  |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSPVariables6.svg) | **Say:** We can evaluate expressions that include variable names. To do that, first make a copy of the sticky note inside the variable. Then evaluate the expression the way you normally would. These two examples show you how. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation: ** Click through to see the answers.  |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSPVariables7.svg) | **Do This:** Evaluate these expressions. Make sure to pay attention to whether it evaluates to a string or a number. <br><br> **Note:** Have students share their answers by holding up the sticky notes for each solution. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation: ** Click through to see the answers. | \n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSPVariables8.svg) | **Say:** Now let's write programs. We're going to stop using sticky notes, but will highlight strings and numbers to help you remember the difference. |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSPVariables9.svg) | **Say:** Here's what a program looks like. The var command tells the computer to create a variable. |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSPVariables10.svg) | **Say:** The left arrow is called the \"assignment operator\". That's just a fancy word for \"put this value in the baggy\". If we wanted to read line 01 we would say \"pow gets 3\". We know that variables can only hold one sticky note or value. So if we try to assign a variable that already has a value in it, we just throw the old one away. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation: ** Click through to run the program. <br><br> **Say:** In a computer you don't actually put the old number in a trash can, it's totally deleted! The numbers are stored as electrical charges somewhere in your computer's memory. When you assign a new number to a variable it actually erases the old number, and stores  the new number in its place. |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSPVariables11.svg) | **Do This:** Run this program. Compare your results with another group. <br><br> **Note:** Walk around the room making sure students are following the rules correctly.  No baggies should have more than one sticky note in them. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation: ** Click through to see the answers.  |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSPVariables12.svg) | **Say:** Now let's combine what we've learned. You can use assignment with expressions. In order for this to work you need to evaluate first, then assign. This makes sense because we know we can only put one sticky note in the variable baggy. |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSPVariables13.svg) | **Do This:** Run the program. Compare your results with another group. <br><br> **Note:** Walk around the room making sure students are evaluating before they assign. Reinforce the language \"gets\" for the assignment operator. For example, line 02 would read \"fly gets two plus day\". <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation: ** Click through to see the answers. |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSPVariables14.svg) | **Say:** We're not going to highlight our strings and numbers anymore. We can just use double quotes around the strings to tell the difference.  |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSPVariables15.svg) | **Do This:** Run through this program together as a class. <br><br> **Note:** Reinforce: <br><br> Evaluate,  then assign <br><br> As shown on line 04, there's no special \"connection\" made between variables. All we're doing is moving information around. <br><br> Variables only hold one value, the old one is \"thrown away\" (again, what's happening is that assignment replaces the electric charges somewhere inside the computer so the old value is actually \"erased\" or \"deleted\") <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation: ** Click through to run the program. |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-4---Variables,-Conditionals,-and-Functions_slide22.svg) | **Do This:** Run this program. Compare your results with another group. <br><br> **Note:** Have students hold up their two baggies when they're done. Make sure students are evaluating and then assigning. Call out that last three lines which can be a little nutty to think about. You're using a variable's value as part of the assignment. This lets it \"count up by one\". <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation: ** Click through to see the answers.  |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSPVariables17.svg) | **Do This:** Review the key takeaways with students. |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSPVariables18.svg) | **Say:** In some programming languages the assignment operator is not written with an arrow but is written as an equal sign. |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSPVariables19.svg) | **Say:** Here's how the assignment operator looks in Javascript. We'll see more of this in the next lesson! <br><br> **Note:** In math = means \"are equal forever\". In programming = means \"put this value in this variable\".|\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here are some tips to help you throughout the presentation.\n\n* There are opportunities throughout the presentation for students to actively engage. At these moments students should be making things with their manipulatives or using them to answer questions. Use these opportunities to check progress.\n* There is a fair amount of new vocabulary introduced but it is introduced gradually and with intentional repetition. Make a point of actively modeling the use of new terms.\n* The most important goal here is building a mental model. It is ok if students have some open questions that will get resolved over the subsequent conditional lessons.\n* Both you and students can use the \"Key Takeaways\" to check your understanding at the end."

These are two different types of data. Numbers and strings can be combined together using operators to make expressions. Expressions are evaluated before storing in variables. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-4---Variables,-Conditionals,-and-Functions2.svg) | **Say:** Boolean values are another type of data. They can store the values “true” or “false”. Why would we want that information? Booleans are used to make decisions. If something is true, do this. If something is false, do that. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> **Do This:** You only need two blue sticky notes today. Write down “true” on one and “false” on the other. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-4---Variables,-Conditionals,-and-Functions3.svg) | **Say:** Let’s look at this expression. Take a guess as to what Boolean value this evaluates to. <br><br> **Do This:** Hold up the sticky note with the correct value. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> **Say:** The expression evaluates to true, because 3 is less than 8. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> **Say:** The less than symbol is a comparison operator. When we see a comparison operator, we need to stop and evaluate for a Boolean value. There are six different comparison operators - you may be familiar with some of them from math class. Notice the double equal signs for \"equal to\". Here we are distinguishing from a single equal sign that is used to assign value to a variable. We read a single equal sign as “gets the value”. A double equal sign can be read as \"equal to”. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-4---Variables,-Conditionals,-and-Functions4.svg) | **Say:** Both sides of the relational operator should be reduced to a single value before we can compare. Think of it in terms of sticky notes. You should have only one sticky note on each side. <br><br> **Do This:** What does 3 + 6 equate to? <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> **Say:** Right: 9! Now we can compare 9 and 8 using the relational operator: less than. <br><br> **Do This:** Does this evaluate to true or false? Hold up the correct sticky note. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-4---Variables,-Conditionals,-and-Functions-5.svg) | **Say:** Let’s evaluate these expressions line by line. It may be helpful to use your sticky notes here. <br><br> **Do This:** Reduce each side of the relational operator to one sticky note. Then evaluate for a Boolean value. Compare your answers with a partner. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation:** When the class is finished, click through to view the answers. The third line may be a little tricky. Remind students to evaluate the information in the parenthesis first. In the fourth line, draw attention to the double equal signs and remind the class double equal signs are a signal to compare if both sides are the same. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-4---Variables,-Conditionals,-and-Functions-6.svg) | **Say:** The expressions that we evaluate can also contain variables. Remember, variables store information. This information can be different data types like numbers, strings, or even Boolean values themselves. For now, we are going to stick with numbers. <br><br> **Do This:** With a partner, reduce both sides of the relational operator. Then evaluate for a Boolean value. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation:** When the class is finished, click through for the answer. Draw attention to the note: any expression that can be evaluated for true or false is known as a Boolean Expression. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-4---Variables,-Conditionals,-and-Functions7.svg) | **Say:** At the beginning of class, we talked about how Booleans are used to make decisions. Let’s see that in action. Consider the following question: Can I go to the movies? I’m allowed to if it’s before 8 o’clock. This may seem like a simple decision! But let’s think about this like a computer. <br><br> **Do This:** What information would the computer need to know in order to answer the question. Create a  baggie variable to store the information. Give it a name. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-4---Variables,-Conditionals,-and-Functions8.svg) | **Say:** This is a flowchart. It’s an organized way to make a decision or come to a conclusion. Creating a flowchart helps us think like a computer. At the top, we are listing the variables that are needed. Your variable might be called time or clock or really anything. It doesn’t matter as long as you use the same name every time you refer to the variable. For this example, I’m naming my variable “time”. Let’s step through the flowchart with an example to see how it works. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-4---Variables,-Conditionals,-and-Functions9.svg) | ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br>**Say:** It’s 9 o’clock. Can I go to the movies? <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> **Say:** First I assign 9 to the variable time, then I move on to the diamond section. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> **Say:** I see a comparison operator, which let’s me know that we need to stop and evaluate the Boolean expression. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> **Say:** First reduce both sides to a single value. Then evaluate for a Boolean value. In this case, The Boolean expression evaluates to false. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> **Say:** Follow the “false” path, and we arrive at the result: “I can’t go to the movies.” <br><br> **Note:** If students are confused, return back to the previous slide and try running some examples together as a class. Students can hold up true or false when evaluating the Boolean expression. Once students get the hang of using a flowchart, continue on to the next slide. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-4---Variables,-Conditionals,-and-Functions10.svg) | **Say:** Here’s another decision that needs to be made. I’m not sure if I have won the game I’m playing. I have won it if my score * (times) my lives is greater than 10. <br><br> **Do This:** Direct students to create baggie variables for the information that needs to be stored and write down the Boolean expression on a spare sticky note or scrap paper. Groups then compare their Boolean expressions. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-4---Variables,-Conditionals,-and-Functions11.svg) | **Say:** Take a look at the Boolean expression in the decision section of the flowchart. Is this similar to what you and your partner wrote? Are there other ways we could construct this? (score and lives might have different names, score and lives might be in opposite order, you could write it as 10 < score * lives). <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> **Do This:** With a partner, try following the flowchart with a few different inputs. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-4---Variables,-Conditionals,-and-Functions12.svg) | **Say:** Here's a new decision we need to make. <br><br> **Do This:** With a partner walk through the steps on the screen. Think about what the Boolean expression will look like. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-4---Variables,-Conditionals,-and-Functions13.svg) | **Say:** Here's a flowchart for the question we just considered. <br><br> **Do This:** With your partner, step through the flowchart with a few different inputs. <br><br> **Note:** After students have practice on their own, call on one group to give input values for `dogAge` and `myAge` and step through the flowchart as a class.|\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-4---Variables,-Conditionals,-and-Functions14.svg) | **Say:** What happens if my decision requires several steps? I want to adopt a cat, but I have to have both 40 dollars and be over 14 years old. <br><br> **Note:** Emphasize precise language here. The Boolean is checking if I *have* 40 dollars - that's exactly 40, not one cent more! In the Conditional Practice lesson, students will return to this flowchart and edit it to account for having more than 40 dollars. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-4---Variables,-Conditionals,-and-Functions15.svg) | **Say:** Let's get setup for stepping through the decision making process for this question. <br><br> **Do This:** Set up your baggies, and discuss with a partner how the flowchart might be set up. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-4---Variables,-Conditionals,-and-Functions16.svg) | **Say:** This flowchart looks a little different from the previous one. There are two stopping points where a Boolean expression is evaluated. Let’s try this out with an example. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation:** Click through, one step at a time with the class. When you get to a decision point, before clicking to the next animation have students evaluate the expression and hold up a blue sticky note. <br><br> **Say:** Notice in question box, I’ve stated that I can adopt the cat if I have 40 dollars AND (emphasize) I am over 14 years old. I am checking two things. Let’s look at a way to simplify that process. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-4---Variables,-Conditionals,-and-Functions17.svg) | **Say:** In the previous example, we had two Boolean expressions to evaluate. We can use logical operators to compare the results of those Boolean expressions. The logical operators we will look at are && (AND), || (OR), and ! (NOT). When we see a Logical Operator, it’s another clue that we need to stop and evaluate for a Boolean value. Here, two expressions have already been evalauted to Boolean values. If something is true and false, it evaluates to false. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> **Say:** Think back to the cat example. It was true that I was old enough to adopt the cat, but false that I had enough money. Therefore, I followed the false path to the output that stated I could not adopt a cat. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-4---Variables,-Conditionals,-and-Functions18.svg) | **Say:** Now we're going to take a look at something called a Truth Table. We are going to change the color of the sticky notes a little bit. Boolean values will still be on blue stickies, but *true* will be a dark blue, and *false* a light blue. <br><br> **Note:** there is no need to supply two different colors of blue sticky notes for these slides. Students can follow along. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-4---Variables,-Conditionals,-and-Functions19.svg) | **Say:** This is a Truth Table. It demonstrates all the possible combinations of true and false and what they would evaluate to if combined with the logical operator && (AND). The first one seems obvious to us - if something is true and another thing is true, then the whole thing is true!. Read through each row, and consider what is being stated. In rows 2 and 3, if one value is false, the whole thing evaluates to false. This is what happened with the cat example. On the final line, if both values are false, the final evaluation is false. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> **Say:** What's the takeway? In evaluating two Boolean expressions with the AND operator, both must be true in order for the whole expression to evaluate as true. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-4---Variables,-Conditionals,-and-Functions20.svg) | **Say:** Now let's consider a Truth Table for OR. <br><br> **Do This:** With a partner, evaluate each row. For example, if the first sticky is *True* or the second sticky is *True* what do you think the whole expression will evaluate to: true or false? <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation:** Stop line by line and allow time for groups to make their predictions. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> **Say:** For the OR Truth Table, if either sticky note is *True* the expression evaluates to true. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-4---Variables,-Conditionals,-and-Functions21.svg) | **Say:** The ! NOT table is simple because it reverses the value. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation:** As a class quickly state what the opposite values are and click through the animations. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-4---Variables,-Conditionals,-and-Functions22.svg) | **Say:** Let’s return to the cat example. How can we write a single expression that accounts for all the information that needs to be checked? <br><br> **Do This:** With a partner, create the expression using logical operators. <br><br> **Note:** It’s ok if students struggle with this activity. After a few minutes, move on to the next slide and reveal the answer. This will help students make the connection. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-4---Variables,-Conditionals,-and-Functions23.svg) | ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation:** Click through the animation step by step and follow along as a class. Allow time to predict at decision points. When the truth table (yellow box) appears on the screen, take a moment to remind students what this is and what it demonstrates. If a value is true and another value is true, it evaluates to true. It’s not expected that students will memorize the truth tables, but they should be familiar with how they work. <br><br> **Note:** If you have extra time, try running this flowchart with other inputs. Try changing the conditions and then running the flowchart (i.e. I can adopt the cat if I have 40 dollars OR I am over 14 years old) <br><br> **Say:** Today we used flowcharts to demonstrate how computers make decisions. In the next class, we will investigate how decisions are made in code. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-4---Variables,-Conditionals,-and-Functions24.svg) | **Do This:** Give students a few minutes to craft their own flowcharts and test on each other following the instructions on the screen. <br><br> **Note:** Simple flowcharts are fine, or students can build more complex models. Students are ready to move on when the majority of the class has made and tested a flowchart. \n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-4---Variables,-Conditionals,-and-Functions25.svg) | ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation:** Review the key takeaways on the screen with students. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-4---Variables,-Conditionals,-and-Functions-26.svg) |<br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation:** Review the key takeaways with students.  |"

Display the code at the front so you can talk through it together.*\n  * **The goal:** The goal of this investigation is to get practice carefully reading a program that uses the new concept of conditionals as well as build on their knowledge and understanding of variables.\n    \n    * **What to look for:** As students describe their section of code, push students to go beyond reading the comments in their section of code to describe what their code does.  For example, instead of saying “It increases the score by one”, students should explain HOW that happens.  They might say “The value stored in the score variable increases by 1 and then the setProperty is used to show the increased score on the screen”.\n\n* **Modify**: Have groups return to their original seats. Give them a couple minutes to work on the modify the app so that the game ends once a user has 0 lives remaining."

This is a the normal order we're used to.\n\n  \t* In Style 2 you sing the lyrics “out of order”. After line 09 you’re going to sing line 35\n\n  \t* It’s shorter to write the song but it’s the same song and will take the same time / lyrics to sing.\n\n  \t* Style 2 removes repetition and it also makes it a little easier to understand the overall structure of the song\n\n"

Throughout this course, you want to see them moving along the \"never - after - during - before\" scale. \n\nAt this point students are still learning to identify repeated code and replace it with a function. This would align with the \"after\" level. In the Functions Make project and the Unit 4 project they are encouraged to anticipate the need for functions in advance. Rather than write code twice and then remove the duplicate code by creating a function later, they should begin deciding early that they'll need a function. The \"updateScreen() pattern\" helps reinforce this point. \n\nReinforce this language in the classroom, though remember it's only a guide. Not every student will immediately be able to move on to \"during\" or \"before\". Different approaches also work better in different contexts, and many experienced programmers will typically operate in the \"during\" mode unless they're building a large and complex project.\n"

So far we have learned how to use functions to remove repeated code in our programs. Early on it's common to realize you need a function only after you've completely written the same chunk of code in two places. As you get better, however, you'll realize sooner and sooner in the process that you're likely going to need a function, and will be able avoid writing repeated code before putting it inside a function. Eventually you'll want to anticipate what your functions are going to be even before you start programming. These are the \"during\" and \"before\" levels we read about yesterday.\r\n\r\nIn today's Make lesson and the following project you'll have a chance to practice this.

These questions are mapped to topics with each topic having a handful of questions available.\n\nThe College Board has a few strict guidelines about how topic questions can be used. In particular, students may not receive a grade based on performance on topic questions nor can they be used for teacher evaluation. Beyond these requirements, however, they are primarily intended to formatively assess student progress and learning as they prepare for the end of course exam.\n\nWithin our own course we recommend that you use them in a variety of ways:\n\n* Throughout the unit assign topic questions to students related to the topics students are learning about that day or that week\n* Prior to the unit assessment assign topic questions to help students practice and prepare for the summative assessment\n* After the unit assessment use these topic questions to help students track their progress towards preparation for the AP assessment\n\n![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/topics4_exilLPP.png)\n\nClick for more info: [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pjzi6hjYC6WJPjVGiCfsevZcfQQ-c7TgAlprjXjNrwo/edit?usp=sharing)\n"
