It begins with a discussion on the impact of past technological innovations on society. Students then explore the concept of generative AI through the lens of someone familiar only with its hype, aiming to foster understanding and responsible engagement with AI technology. A key part of the lesson is the introduction of the Input, Storage, Processing, Output (ISPO) framework, essential for understanding generative AI's workings.",

Next they learn about the temperature setting in chatbots and how it influences the creativity and reliability of responses. Through hands-on experimentation, students will adjust the temperature to see its effect on the chatbot's answers. Finally, students explore how chatbots can hallucinate to produce incorrect or misleading information. Throughout the unit, students will monitor and document these instances, enhancing their critical awareness of AI's limitations."

This idea ties into the lesson as we explore a new chatbot that has been specifically designed to act as a medical expert. Students observe how speaking to the medical expert chatbot is different from the typical chatbot due to how the both has been fine-tuned on additional medical data. Students learn about the fine-tuning process, then explore additional models on the Hugging Face website to see additional fine-tuned examples."

Then, students explore an example of a Library chatbot and use a Foresight in AI table to examine the intended and unintended users and use-cases for this chatbot.

Make sure students know where the instructions panel is, can send messages, know how to clear the chat, and know how to copy the chat. Building this fluency early will make later lessons easier.\n\n**Teaching Tip: Not Every Flagged Message is Inappropriate** - When a student's on-task message is flagged, it doesn't necessarily indicate inappropriate behavior; it may simply be due to a specific word triggering our filters. We encourage trying alternative words or questions. Context is crucial, as legitimate discussions can sometimes be flagged. For instance, messages mentioning \"Hitler\" are automatically flagged, which has helped us monitor student programs in the past but in this unit it affects almost any discussion on World War II, even legitimate ones. Therefore, a flagged message should be carefully reviewed to discern if it's genuinely inappropriate or just caught by our system's parameters."

A key goal in this discussion is to draw out all of the intersecting factors that could cause a prompt like this to snowball. Students may think this is a simple prompt around writing social media - if so, push them to consider:\n\t\t<br />- Social media follows a specific format, including hashtags and tagging, which may be hard to describe in a prompt\n\t\t<br />- A key part of marketing is considering the audience - who are the people Hannah needs to reach?\n\t\t<br />- Hannah needs a tone that represents her voice, but also allows her to advertise (and get paid) by her sponsor, which is a difficult needle to thread.\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t<br />Emphasizing all of these intersecting points is a great tie-in to today’s lesson.\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td style=\"width: 25%\"><img src=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1keAW0kOKmbkg9a9Q6LrXhjPAW40T_GZEMAj2BSYcEQM/export/png?id=1keAW0kOKmbkg9a9Q6LrXhjPAW40T_GZEMAj2BSYcEQM&pageid=g2b5b268c506_0_197\"></td>\n    <td style=\"width: 75%\">\n      <i class=\"fa fa-microphone\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> <strong>Say:</strong> Designing system prompts to meet specific needs can be difficult, with so many intersecting requirements.

We recommend briefly exploring the levels yourself before reading the rest of the lesson plan. Some levels are meant to be completed independently by students, but others are meant to motivate class discussion or lead to moments of direct instruction in the slides. Very rarely should students be working through levels completely self-paced.\n\n**Teacher Exemplars:** Verified teachers can access exemplar responses and \"what success looks like\" tips for each level in the Links section of the lesson plan. If the resource doesn't appear for you, you may need to become a verified teacher - [learn more about this process here](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/115001550131-How-to-Become-a-Verified-Teacher).\n\n**Teaching with Student Responses:** Certain level types are designed to be leveraged with our [Student Summary feature](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/14544890300301-Can-I-see-a-summary-of-all-my-students-responses-for-question-based-levels), specifically: _Predict & Discuss_ and _Mid-Lesson Check-In_ levels.

This “aha” moment can also be relevant to today’s lesson, as we attempt to give step-by-step instructions and examples to chatbots. You might consider showing your class a video of this activity - for example, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/okkIyWhN0iQ?t=67\" target=\"_blank\">this version from Harvard’s CS50 class</a> (best watched at 1.5x speed) - to reference later when students inevitably struggle getting the steps just right for their chatbots."

After students lock in their predictions, the teacher leads a discussion asking for students to share their observations and hypotheses. There are no right-or-wrong answers - they’re just predictions. The teacher should avoid validating any predictions - instead, as the lesson progresses, students will get the chance to investigate their hypotheses and see how well their predictions matched with reality. This means the most important part of these discussions are students feeling comfortable sharing their intuitions and forming opinion, and less about “right or wrong” answers.

This can help us understand how the sentence “The food in Tucson is awesome - some great restaurants in Tucson are Poco and Moms, Kingfisher, and Franks.” impacts our model.\n- In the initial training data, a word like “Franks” was probably “close” to an entirely different set of words. For example: it could be “close” to “hot dog” or “person” or “blunt” because of the phrase “Let me be frank with you…”\n- This sentence creates a new association between “Franks” and the phrase “great restaurant”, along with other great restaurants like Kingfisher and Poco and Moms.\n- This helps update the embedding for “Franks” so it is now “closer” to other great restaurants, and more likely to be listed in a chatbot response."

This correlates to how retrieval works in a more realistic sense with actual language models: instead of looking at individual words or statements, modern large-language models ingest entire documents or manuals or websites in order to augment their knowledgebase. For that reason, try to encourage students to put their energy into finding quality sources (like websites or books) to copy from, since this is the more realistic behavior of language models outside of this lab."

This is very loosely inspired by real-world events where school districts relied on chatbots like ChatGPT to make decisions about books to comply with state laws. In an effort to comply with these new laws, several school districts hastily resorted to using AI to make recommendations on certain books to remove from circulation. This is an example of how an intended user - libraries and schools - were using chatbots for a surprising and unintended use case with a wide variety of affected uses (also both intended and unintended).

Students who may have been confident and engaged in earlier lessons may find themselves deflated by the task of writing about their chatbots and describing their decisions. It can be helpful to acknowledge this change in dynamic, but encourage students to lean into it rather than away from it. Taking time to document and describe our chatbots and other digital artifacts is a core part of any new technology, and might take a different set of skills but is just as important. Be sure to provide writing supports to students who may need it, such as having students explain it to you first before writing it down."
