Students participate in planning and feedback activities to solve problems, reinforce software development practices and self-image as software engineers, and improve their programs.\n\nIf there is not enough time for the three-day project, a one-day option achieves the targeted learning objectives and goals. If using this option, refer to the [**Abstract Data Art Project 1-Day Lesson Plan**](https://studio.code.org/s/csa5-2023/lessons/13).
