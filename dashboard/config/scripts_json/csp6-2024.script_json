The main challenges are that you’d need to make a variable for each piece of information and it could get difficult to name them all. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-20-21-U5-Lists-Explore-Slide-3.svg) | **Say:** Let's look at how to use lists |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-20-21-U5-Lists-Explore-Slide-4.svg) | **Say:** Today we’re going to practice using a new way to store information called a list. Follow the instructions here to make a list of your own. <br><br>**Do This:** Have students create their own list. Circulate the room to check on how they’re doing. Make sure they share with another group.|\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-20-21-U5-Lists-Explore-Slide-5.svg)| **Say:** Your list is made up of elements. Each element has its own index. Indexes are just numbers that count up from zero. The length of the list is how many elements it contains. This list has 3 elements and indexes from 0 to 2.|\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-20-21-U5-Lists-Explore-Slide-6.jpg)| **Say:** Notice that all the bags can folded up and be placed inside the big variable baggie. Sometimes we want to think about the whole list, sometimes we want to think about individual elements |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-20-21-U5-Lists-Explore-Slide-7.svg)| **Say:** We create a list with this command. It creates a new list and assigns it to a variable. The square brackets indicate we’re making a list. Each value is separated by commas. <br><br> **Do This:** Have students write the command to make their own list and the list of partner group.

Key points to draw out are:\n    \n    * The “Data Library” on the left hand side has different categories of datasets that students can view.\n    * Students need to “import” a data set to be able to see the data inside it or to use the data in the code.\n    * Once imported, students will see the data set in the “Data Browser” area and can click on the name of the Data Set to see the data in table form.\n    * To use the [`getColumn`(#d3e965)](/docs/applab/getColumn/) command, you need the name of the table you want to use and the name of the column from that table.\n    * [`getColumn`(#d3e965)](/docs/applab/getColumn/) will return the column from your table as a list.  You can see it is a list because when it is printed to the console, it has square brackets `[ ]` around the items which are separated by commas.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Modify:** Students choose a new dataset to import to the project.

The model is typically that a term or concept is introduced and modeled and then afterwards students are encouraged to try it out on their own. Trying it out typically means they are writing information on a sticky note and sharing it with another group before discussing the results with the whole class.\n\nSlides with animations have an icon in the bottom left corner to let you know you need to click to reveal more of the slide's content. \n\nTo help you more easily prepare the activity and keep track of your instructions, detailed instructions have been included as speaker notes in the presentation. Here are some tips to help you throughout the presentation.\n\n* There are opportunities throughout the presentation for students to actively engage. At these moments students should be making things with their manipulatives or using them to answer questions. Use these opportunities to check progress.\n* There is a fair amount of new vocabulary introduced but it is introduced gradually and with intentional repetition. Make a point of actively modeling the use of new terms.\n* The most important goal here is building a mental model. It is ok if students have some open questions that will get resolved over the subsequent conditional lessons.\n* Both you and students can use the \"Key Takeaways\" to check your understanding at the end."

You will move a robot around a game board following commands. Here's the first one: [`moveForward()`(#4dd0e1)](/docs/applab/moveForward/). <br><br> **Do This:** Use this command to write a program to move the robot to the purple box. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click through animation to reveal the answer.** |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSPU5_Lists_Loops_Traversals_Loops2.png) | **Say:** This code is repetitive. How can we simplify it? By using a While Loop. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSPU5_Lists_Loops_Traversals_Loops3.png) | **Say:** Here's how a While Loop works. While something is true, the code in the while loop runs, over and over until that thing is no longer true. Let's try it together! |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSPU5_Lists_Loops_Traversals_Loops4.png) | **Say:** Let's run this program together. Set up your board with the robot in the same place as the robot on the screen. We are going to run each step of the loop together. First you will try it on your board, and then we will look at the answers on the screen. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSPU5_Lists_Loops_Traversals_Loops5.png) | **Say:** Read the code with your partner and complete the first round of the loop. You may want a sticky note or a scrap piece of paper out to keep track of the value in the variable. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click through to view the answer after students have had a chance to follow the code on their own board.

In this case, we have five text boxes named `\"text0\"`, `\"text1\"`, `\"text2\"`, `\"text3\"`, and `\"text4\"`\n* `\"text\" + i ` is evaluated each round of the loop. \n    * First round: `\"text0\"`\n    * Second round: `\"text1\"`\n    * Third round: `\"text2\"`\n    * Fourth round: `\"text3\"`\n    * Fifth round: `\"text4\"`\n* So when the first round of the loop is executed, the element with the `\"text0\"` ID is changed to whatever information is in the for loop. \n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Do This:** \n\n* What happens if you change the text box variable names? \n* Try changing them from `\"text0\"`, `\"text1\"`, etc. to `\"textbox0\"`, `\"textbox1\"`, etc.\n* Navigate back to the code. What do you need to change in the code for the program to still work?\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Do This:**\n\n* What happens if you change the Boolean expression `i < 5` in the for loops?\n* Change all the Boolean expressions to one of the options below, run the program, and discuss. Then move to the next option and repeat:\n\t* `i < 4`\n\t* `i < 3`\n\t* `i <=4`"

Use these opportunities to check progress.\n* There is a fair amount of new vocabulary introduced but it is introduced gradually and with intentional repetition. Make a point of actively modeling the use of new terms.\n* The most important goal here is building a mental model. It is ok if students have some open questions that will get resolved over the subsequent conditional lessons.\n* Both you and students can use the \"Key Takeaways\" to check your understanding at the end.\n\n"

Make sure you and your partner have all the supplies you see on the screen. <br><br> **Note to Teacher:** If you are concerned about time or material management, the Traversal Machines can be prepared ahead of time. You only need one Traversal Machine per pair of students, and machines can be shared between classes. <br><br> There are three places to make cuts: <br><ul><li>The dotted line at the top of the sheet</li><li>The box with the list index</li><li>The box inside of the variable baggy</li></ul>  |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals2.svg) | **Do This:** On a scrap piece of paper or a sticky note, write down the list on the screen.  |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals3.svg) | **Prompt:** What if I want to know if a value is in a list? With a partner, discuss the method you would use to look for an item in a list. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation to reveal suggested answer**|\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals4.svg) | **Say:** Computers are really good at checking things one by one. To do this... let's use a for loop.  |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals5.svg) | **Do This:** Set up the Traversal Machine. <br><br> **Note:** Students use scissors make cuts as directed on the Traversal Machines. As noted before, this can all be done before class to save time. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals6.svg) | **Do This:** Direct students attention to their Traversal Machines as you describe the parts. <br><br> **Say:** This is where we assign the starting value to the counter variable i. Usually we assign it to 0. What else starts with 0? The index of a list! <br><br> **Note:** In Javascript, the index of a list starts at 0. You may want to remind students that on the AP Exam, pseudocode starts the index at 1.|\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals7.svg) | **Say:** This is the Boolean expression that is checked to see if the loop should continue to run. When working with a list, we want to access every element in the list, so we are going to keep the loop going until we have hit list.length. <br><br> **Note:** You may want to remind students that list.length evaluates to the length of a list, which will be different than the last index number. For example, in a list of three, the length is 3 and the index numbers are 0, 1, 2 |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals8.svg) | **Do This:** replace list with the name of your list. In this case, we would replace it with temps. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/Screen-Shot-2020-11-25-at-9.24.37-AM_C2zpJ9H.png) | **Say:** The counter variable i increases after each loop runs. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals9.svg) | **Say:** To access each element in the list, we are going to store the element in a variable inside the for loop. Let's try this out with your Traversal Machine. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> **Do This:** Set up a variable baggy and give it the name element. <br><br> **Note:** You may opt to not use variable baggies at all in this lesson and instead have students keep track of variables on a scrap piece of paper. In this case, the variable element is tracking the local variable that is inside of the for loop. With every round of the for loop, the variable will update. It's not necessary to build a baggy for the variable i - this will be represented on the Traversal Machine itself as a drawing of a baggy. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals10.svg) | **Do This:** Pull the index sheet up to assign i to 0. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> **Say:** Notice how the variable in the baggy has changed. Each time the loop is executed, the variable i increases by one. <br><br> **Note:** For the following six slides, students will follow along with what's happening on the screen with their own Traversal Machines. Give students a few seconds to pull up the index sheet at each step. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals11.svg) | **Say:** Look at the list on the screen. Right now i=0. <br><br> **Do This:** Evaluate the statement in the for loop to see what value is stored by the variable element. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click through animation:** There are six steps to click through. <code>temps[0]</code> evaluates to 77 which is stored in the variable <code>element</code> |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals12.svg) | **Do This:** Now pull the index sheet up one spot. i now equals 1. Evaluate the statement inside the for loop. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click through animation:** There are seven steps to click through. <code>temps[1]</code> evaluates to 85 which is stored in the variable <code>element</code>  |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals13.svg) | **Do This:** Pull the index sheet up again. i now equals 2. Evaluate the statement inside the for loop. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click through animation:** There are seven steps to click through. <code>temps[2]</code> evaluates to 89 which is stored in the variable <code>element</code>  |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals14.svg) | **Do This:** Pull the index sheet up again. i now equals 3.

No - so we exit out of the loop. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals16.svg) | **Say:** Are you starting to see a pattern here? <br><br><ul><li>We are able to access each item in a list by using a for loop.</li><li>This is called traversal. We are traveling or traversing through a list one element at a time.</li></ul>  |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals17.svg) | **Say:** Let's look for a number in the temps list. It's easy for you to scan the list quickly with your own eyes, but for this exercise, let's pretend you are a computer and must use the Traversal Machine to look for the number. <br><br> **Do this:** <br><ul><li>Write down the code to the left on a sticky note and put it in your for loop.</li><li> Pull the index sheet up each time you go through the loop.</li><li>Run the loop until it is finished</li><li>Your \"console\" can be a scrap piece of paper.</li><li>When done, compare your console with another group.</li></ul>  |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals18.svg) | **Say:** Check your console. Does it look like what you see on the screen? The number 85 was found at index 1, the second number in the list. Notice that i currently has the value 4. This is because we stopped after four rounds. Element is currently storing 65, the last element that we accessed, at index 3. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals19.svg) | **Say:** Now I want to find the smallest number in a list. I am going to reduce the list to the smallest number. We are going to leave the baggies behind now. You can use a scrap piece of paper to store the global variable <code>var min = temps[0]</code> <br><br> **Do This:** <br><ul><li>Evaluate that statement to find the value stored in min.</li><li>Run the program</li><li>Update the variable min as needed</li></ul> |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-5_Traversals20.svg) | **Say:** The smallest number in the list is 65.

Then as a class address any confusion over how the app works. \n\n* **The goal:** The goal of this investigation is to give students the opportunity to see lists traversed for different reasons and with different outcomes.   Students should look at the code for their assigned function and make sense of what the function does overall and how it does it.  \n* **What to look for:** It may be helpful to re-watch the [video](https://youtu.be/RQ6GJt9f2vg) in the U5L10 - Traversals Explore lesson starting at 3:07 to hear how the speaker describes a section of code that processes a list for a specific purpose.  Listening to that explanation will help give you an idea of what student explanations of their functions should sound like.  \n    \n    For example, when explaining the average function in this investigation, students should describe what the function does.  In this case, the function calculates the average of the values stored in the `mileTimes` list and stores that value in the `avg` variable. In addition to describing what the function does, students should describe how the function works.  This will involve more detail.  \n  * Students should be able to describe that the function contains a local variable of `total` which is initialized at 0.  \n  * Then the function uses a for loop to traverse through the `mileTimes` list.  In the loop, each value inside `mileTimes` list is accessed and added to the current value stored inside the total variable.  \n  * When the loop reaches the end of the list, the loop ends and the total variable contains the sum of all the `mileTimes`.  In the last line of the function, the value stored in `avg` is updated by dividing the value stored in `total` by the total number of elements in the `mileTimes` list.  \n\n    \n \nWhen you bring the class together to talk about how the app works, you should talk both about what the functions do as well as how they work.  There likely is not time to go over all four functions, but discussing one or two of them will ensure the full class has an opportunity to hear how their peers describe code.",

It is not about getting the “right answer” as much as it is about building skills in your students to read, test, and make sense of code that they haven’t seen before.  Finally, you will notice that for the levels where the directions ask students to “Modify” the code, you will find “Example Solutions” in the “Teacher Panel” of that level. \n\n**A Note About Datasets:** In general, we believe individual teachers have the best knowledge of their students and the content that will engage them. From that perspective, we also think it's appropriate to make choices about our content & curriculum that best suits your classroom. With that said, the Spotify dataset updates automatically every day according to the latest trends - we hope it provides a real-world social connection for students to engage with datasets, but also understand that we can't control the songs that make it to the top 200 and don't have the bandwidth to filter it on our end. If the songs for a particular day are not appropriate for your students, it may be a good idea to skip that dataset.\n"

These questions are mapped to topics with each topic having a handful of questions available.\n\nThe College Board has a few strict guidelines about how topic questions can be used. In particular, students may not receive a grade based on performance on topic questions nor can they be used for teacher evaluation. Beyond these requirements, however, they are primarily intended to formatively assess student progress and learning as they prepare for the end of course exam.\n\nWithin our own course we recommend that you use them in a variety of ways:\n\n* Throughout the unit assign topic questions to students related to the topics students are learning about that day or that week\n* Prior to the unit assessment assign topic questions to help students practice and prepare for the summative assessment\n* After the unit assessment use these topic questions to help students track their progress towards preparation for the AP assessment\n\n![](https://images.code.org/20855b4b37e959abdd2f5a0a8098e0db-Screenshot 2023-04-25 at 3.21.26 PM.png)\n\nClick for more info: [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l9VDL92DCIbTNhTiLGIr-enBOTM4wEDTTQOBlJ7bBhM/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n"

One of the most common errors with lists, therefore, is trying to access indexes that are out of bounds, most notably `list.length`,\n* Syntax errors are common with lists, as the bracket notation is new. Encourage students to use the blocks to help if they need.\n* When using the patterns students may become overly reliant on simply copying and pasting without thinking through what the code from the patterns does.
