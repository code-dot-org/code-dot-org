Your students will be able to create working code which they can test out in the simulator before transferring them to a real micro:bit over a USD cable. They can then unplug the micro:bit from the computer, attach a battery pack, and use their projects anywhere.\n\nBy making micro:bit projects, your students can take their code off the screen and make self-contained physical devices they can hold in the palm of their hands, making abstract computing concepts tangible.",

(Three additional slides have been provided for this part of the activity if needed.)\n\n\n\n\nOnce the class has had some practice, you can encourage students to nest conditionals inside one another. Make sure they understand that if the card is red, YOUR team is awarded 1 point, and then _nothing else happens_, since the condition was met:\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: Show \"Let's nest conditionals” slide\n\n\n\n\tIf (CARD is RED)\n\t\tAward YOUR team 1 point\n\t\n\tElse\n\t\tIf (CARD is higher than 9)\n\t\t\tAward OTHER team 1 point\n\t\tElse\n\t\t\tAward YOUR team the same number of points on the card\n\n\n\nHere is the same program in pseudocode:\n\n\tIf (card.color == RED ){\n\t\tpoints.yours = points.yours + 1;\n\t}\n\tElse {\n\t\tif (card.value > 9){\n\t\t\tpoints.other = points.other + 1;\n\t\t}\n\t\tElse {\n\t\t\tpoints.yours = points.yours + card.value;\n\t\t}\n\t}"

They will add one conditional at a time that checks how much algae is in the water. \n\n**Level 6** - Look closely at the photos of the ecosystem and the code that represents the situation.\n\n**Level 7** - Students will add a conditional block that checks to see if there is **too much algae**. When the condition is true, the computer will run the code inside the conditional block. In this case, when overfishing occurs, there aren't enough fish to eat all the algae. If there is too much algae, the healthy coral changes costume to become sick coral.\n\n**Level 8** - Students will add a second conditional statement that checks to see if there is **too little algae**. When the condition is true the computer will run the code inside the conditional block. This time the fish will stop everything, then begin leaving the area. These two blocks are glued together to help students easily nest them inside the conditional block.\n\n**Level 9** - Students now add one final conditional statement that checks if the amount of **algae is just right**. When that’s true, the coral changes costume from sick to healthy.\n\n**Level 10** - This is a matching level similar to Level 5 and can be used as a check for understanding, It is also an opportunity to reinforce how the three conditional blocks check the amount of algae (cause) and change the ecosystem accordingly (effect). \n\n"
