Students create messages with their systems and exchange with other groups to ensure the system worked as intended.

They discuss commonalities between working systems and recognize that there are many possible solutions to this problem and what's important is that everyone uses the same arbitrary system to communicate.\r\n",

Students then do a short set of challenges using the Pixelation Widget in order to draw black and white images.

        "purpose": "This lesson introduces another commonly used system of representing information in binary. The most obvious takeaways from the Pixelation Widget will obviously be that a 1 means an \"On\" and a 0 means an \"Off\". What might be less obvious, however, is that the width and height of the image need to be agreed upon in order to interpret the binary image information as well. Finally this is an opportunity to explore how systems for representing information are created. A \"raw\" image is really hard to represent. The idea to turn an image into a grid of black and white squares significantly simplifies this challenge and makes it into the kind of problem that computer scientists knew how to solve. While the activity in this lesson may feel like just typing 0s and 1s, it actually reveals a lot about how people think about representing information in binary, and what challenges and tradeoffs are created as a result.",

After reviewing the process, the class is presented with a decision: whether a city should build a library, pet shelter, or fire department. Students work in teams to collect information on the Internet to help them decide what should be built, then use this information to build an argument that will convince the city council of their choice. They then map what they have done to the problem solving process that they have been using throughout the course, comparing the general problem solving process to its specific application to data problems.",

These lessons also include a pre-survey that you can administer to students.\n\n**Getting Started with Code.org:** Consider watching our [Getting Started with Code.org](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNdX7P76yGw7YUM4Csm1ZZmM) video series for an overview of how to navigate lesson plans, setup a classroom section, and other important features of the Code.org platform. Each video also has a support article if you'd prefer to read or print instructions - [click here to learn more](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/4405629586957-New-how-to-walkthrough-videos-for-teachers-).\n\nIf you are using a learning management system, there may be additional steps to sync your classes with Code.org:\n\n- [Click here](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/115001319312-Setting-up-sections-with-Google-Classroom-sync) for steps to setup your classes with Google Classroom\n- [Click Here](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/115001319312-Setting-up-sections-with-Google-Classroom-sync) for steps to setup your classes with Canvas\n\n**Become a Verified Teacher:** Lesson plans and levels have additional resources and answer keys for Verified Teachers, which is quick process that verifies your position at an educational institution. [Click here to complete a form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdGGAJuaDMBVIRYnimPhAL96w6fCl4UdvhwmynGONM75TWwWw/viewform) and you should have access to verified teacher resources in ~1 business day. Verified teachers also have access to the [\"Teacher's Lounge\"](https://forum.code.org/c/csd/csd-teachers-lounge/444) section of the forums.\n\n**Get Inspired:** Consider watching our [Teacher Tips video playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNcc7Q-PvUVqV249l2JzhJes), featuring current CS Discoveries teachers.",

It needs to be given information using a system that takes into account the fact that it's just a box of wires. \r\n\r\nWhen we change the way that we represent information so that it's easier for a computer to use, we encode that information.

For their image representation, they may wonder whether it is even useful to interpret the binary sequences as numbers. In the end, the purpose of defining all data as numbers is less about the \"reality\" of what the ones and zeros represent, and more about how binary is traditionally interpreted.\n\nFor the second question, allow students to think of different ways that the computer would distinguish between different types of data. While it's not necessary for students to come up with any specific answer, challenge them in any ways that involve human interpretation of context, such as knowing that a name is most likely text and age is most likely a number. Assure them that they will look at the problem again in a couple of lessons."
