During online activities, the role of the teacher is primarily one of encouragement and support. Online lessons are meant to be student-centered, so teachers should avoid stepping in when students get stuck. Some ideas on how to do this are: \r\n\r\n - Utilize pair programming whenever possible during the activity.\r\n - Encourage students with questions/challenges to start by asking their partner.\r\n - Unanswered questions can be escalated to a nearby group, who might already know the solution.\r\n - Remind students to use the debugging process before you approach.\r\n - Have students describe the problem that they’re seeing. What is it supposed to do? What does it do? What does that tell you?\r\n - Remind frustrated students that frustration is a step on the path to learning, and that persistence will pay off.\r\n - If a student is still stuck after all of this, ask leading questions to get the student to spot an error on their own."

During online activities, the role of the teacher is primarily one of encouragement and support. Online lessons are meant to be student-centered, so teachers should avoid stepping in when students get stuck. Some ideas on how to do this are: \n\n - Utilize ***Pair Programming** - student video whenever possible during the activity.\n - Encourage students with questions/challenges to start by asking their partner.\n - Unanswered questions can be escalated to a nearby group, who might already know the solution.\n - Have students describe the problem that they’re seeing. What is it supposed to do? What does it do? What does that tell you?\n - Remind frustrated students that frustration is a step on the path to learning, and that persistence will pay off.\n - If a student is still stuck after all of this, ask leading questions to get the student to spot an error on their own.\n\n**Discuss:** After providing students with end-of-class warnings, grab everyone's attention and get them to reflect on the experiences that they just had.\n\n - Did anyone feel frustrated during any of the puzzles?\n - Did anyone notice the need to be persistent?\n\n**Transition:** Have students grab their Reflection Journals and take a moment to review lessons for themselves."

Third?\n- Where did my program go wrong?\n- What does that tell me?\n    \n**Prompt**: **Debugging** can be frustrating! But persistence can help us get through it. What are some things we can do to persist through frustration? \n\nExample responses:\n\n- Count to 10\n- Take deep breaths\n- Journal about bugs we've found\n- Talk to a partner about bugs\n- Ask for help\n\n**Transition:** Let your students know that frustration is part of coding. Everyone gets bugs! It's okay if they think they have a bug but they can't find or fix it right away. Using strategies like those listed above can help them persist through frustration and solve any problem!"

While displaying a scenario image, read its accompanying script to the class (see below, or the notes beneath each slide in the deck). After each scenario, ask students to vote on which app they would choose for their friend, then discuss their reasons why. \n\n\n\n[slides]\n\n#### The Right App Scenarios\n\n##### Scenario 1: Daisy the Dragon\n\n**Slide 1:** Help! Daisy the Dragon wants to play with her penguin classmates. However, when Daisy talks, her hot breath warms up anyone she is near, and penguins don’t enjoy that AT ALL. So Daisy wants an app that can help her with this problem. \n\n**Slide 2:** Which is the right app for Daisy?\n\n* *Dance Master*: an app that teaches you cool dance moves.\n* *Am I Too Close?!*: an app that shouts “too close!” if you are too close to someone.\n\n**Slide 3:** Daisy decides to use “Am I Too Close?!”, which makes it easier for her to play with her penguin friends! When they get too close, the app warns her with a friendly shout, “Too close!” Daisy and the penguins are happy! “Am I Too Close?!” is the right app for Daisy!\n\n---\n\n##### Scenario 2: Sam the Bat\n\n**Slide 4:** Help! Sam the Bat wants to listen to his favorite music on his phone while he flies through the night sky. He’s considering two different music apps, but he doesn’t know which one is best for him. As a bat, Sam has poor eyesight but excellent hearing. He also happens to sing very well!\n\n**Slide 5:** Which is the right app for Sam? \n\n* *Eyes ‘n Ears*: a music app that has a lot of tiny buttons.\n* *Sing ‘n Play*: a music app that lets you press a BIG green button to record your voice. You sing a part of any song you want to hear, and it’ll play it for you.\n\n**Slide 6:** Sam decides to use “Sing ‘n Play”. He simply presses the BIG green button, sings the first part of a song he likes, then the app plays the entire song for him! It’s that easy! And that’s why “Sing ‘n Play” is the right app for Sam!\n\n---\n\n##### Scenario 3: Codella the Witch\n\n**Slide 7:** Help! Codella the Witch is a serious gamer, and she’s looking for a new game to play. Codella has many different kinds of computers, including a desktop, a laptop, a tablet, and a smartphone. Her favorite games are those she can play on all of her computers, including her smartphone.\n\n**Slide 8:** Which is the right app for Codella? \n\n* *Sort Knight*: a game where you play as a knight who travels around sorting everything. Also has cool dance moves. You can play it on many different kinds of computers!\n* *Mobo-Robo*: a game that lets you build cool robots and make them do whatever you want. You can only play it on smartphones and tablets, though.\n\n**Slide 9:** Codella decides to play “Sort Knight”. At first she’s not sure if she’ll like it (she doesn’t really like sorting things), but she loves that she can play it on any of her computers, and that’s really important to her as a serious gamer. The more Codella plays “Sort Knight”, the more she loves it. “Sort Knight” is the right app for her!\n\n[/slides]",

Anton the Alien has crash-landed on Earth and is waiting for his fellow aliens to come rescue him. Until then, he has nothing to do, so he heads to a local library to find a book to read (Anton LOVES reading books). Unfortunately, all the books at the library are written in Earthling languages like English, Chinese, Spanish, and many others. So Anton is out of luck! Or is he?\n\n**Slide 11:** As an alien, Anton is very good with technology! He immediately opens his super-powered smartphone to look for an app that can help him solve his problem at the library, but he can’t find anything he likes! So let’s each design our own app for Anton! \n\n[/slides]\n\n**Distribute**: Pass out crayons/pencils/etc to each student as they open their reflection journals.

I would need to program the character to only move when I put my finger on the screen of my phone.\n\t\t- Putting my finger on the screen would then become an \"event\" that tells my character to move.\n\n**Say**: _In earlier lessons, we created algorithms that allowed us to control a friend or bird for several steps at a time. It was fun and useful, but what happens when you don’t know everything that you want your friend to do in advance? This is where events come in!_\n\n\n**Directions:**\n\n- Project the ***Controller Image** onto your classroom screen.\n\n ![](https://code.org/curriculum/docs/csf/c1_TheBigEvent1.png)\n\n- Decide with your class what each button does. We suggest:\n\t- Pink Button -> Say “Wooooo!”\n\t- Teal Button -> “Yeah!”\n\t- Purple Dial -> “Boom!”\n- Practice tapping the buttons on the overhead and having your class react.\n- Add some button sequences into the mix and have the students try to keep up with their sounds.\n- Let your class know that every time you push a button, it is an “event” that lets them know what they are expected to do next.\n- Get the class started on a planned task before interrupting them again with the buttons. We suggest:\n\t- Counting to 10\n\t- Singing “Old MacDonald”\n- Once their plan is underway, interject button presses sporadically.\n- Continue the blend until they understand the difference between actions that are guided by a plan and those that are event driven."

Students will examine how cause and effect can be seen in animals as you view the behavioral patterns of offspring (the cause) to determine how to increase the offspring’s survival (the effect).\n\n*Standards Addressed:*\n\n- **CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.SL.1.1:** Participate in collaborative conversations with diverse partners about grade 1 topics and texts with peers and adults in small and larger groups.\n\n- **CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.SL.1.4:** Describe people, places, things, and events with relevant details, expressing ideas and feelings clearly.\n\n- **CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.1.G.A.1:** Distinguish between defining attributes (e.g., triangles are closed and three-sided) versus non-defining attributes (e.g., color, orientation, overall size); build and draw shapes to possess defining attributes.\n\n- **NGSS.1-LS1-2:** Read texts and use media to determine patterns in behavior of parents and offspring that help offspring survive. [Clarification Statement: Examples of patterns of behaviors could include the signals that offspring make (such as crying, cheeping, and other vocalizations) and the responses of the parents (such as feeding, comforting, and protecting the offspring).]"

This can be done in many ways, but here are a few:\n\n* **Public Demo**: Select a few exemplary volunteers to briefly demo their projects in front of the class. As they do so, have them touch on what the planning-to-coding experience was like for them, including ideas they'd still like to implement. \n* **Pair Playtesting**: Have students or groups pair up and playtest each other's projects. As they do, ask them to provide positive and constructive feedback to each other. The benefit here is that students will have the opportunity to provide and respond to feedback in a smaller setting. \n* **Gallery Walk**: Ensure all students have their projects ready for testing. Have students move \"musical chairs\"-style to another computer and playtest the project there for a few minutes, until they receive a signal from you to move to another computer. Repeat this every few minutes. While there is less opportunity for structured communication here, this ensures students get to demo as many of their peers' projects as possible.",
