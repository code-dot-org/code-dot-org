Here are two hands on activities to try in your classroom:\n\n- **Book sort**: Have groups of students organize books into genre piles, based only on the book cover. Students make inferences based on the book cover about a book's genre.\n- **Cover comparison**: show students multiple covers for the same book. Engage in a discussion about what is different in each cover and evaluation which version is best.\n\n**Computer Science**: In this module, students will learn the basics of coding using code.org's Sprite Lab. \n\n- To introduce students to the idea of events use this unplugged activity: [The Big Event](https://studio.code.org/s/course1/lessons/15/levels/1) (15-minute activity). The teacher will press buttons on a paper remote and students will react depending on which button is pressed.\n\n- [Making Sprites](https://studio.code.org/s/coursef-2023/lessons/3) (50 minutes) is a great, self-paced introduction to the basics of coding with sprites."

The books featured are _The Lightning Thief_, _Front Desk_, and _Refugee_. Have students answer the following questions.\n\n**Discuss**: \n- _Which of these books would you want to read based on its cover?_ \n- _What is the target audience for each of these books?_\n\n**Discussion Goal**: Students should mention what they see featured on the cover, including the title, the author, the scenery, the characters, and other information, such as awards the book has won or highlighted author quotes. Have students discuss which features of the cover capture their attention and make them want to pick up the book. \n\nPerhaps, the book covers depict some of the main characters or settings in the book. For students who have read the books featured, ask _“Does the cover art accurately reflect the content and mood of the book?”_ \n\nFor students who have not read the books, ask _“If you had to guess, what do you think this story is about?”_\n\nStudents should also recognize that a good book cover design will reflect the book’s themes without giving away the ending. See if students can determine the genre of the book (e.g. fantasy, mystery, non-fiction) based on context clues. This will help them determine the target audience for each book. For context:\n\n- _The Lightning Thief_ is part of the larger Percy Jackson series which are fantasy-adventure stories.\n- _Front Desk_ is a realistic fiction novel based on the author’s lived experience.\n- _Refugee_ is a historical fiction novel grounded in real-world events.\n",

Once students have formed a straight line, the first student at the end of one line is directed to walk down to face the last students at the other end of the line, followed by the other students until the line is “folded in half” and everyone has a partner. The line closer to the teacher starts by asking the questions on the slide and the student on the opposite side will answer. Then the roles are reversed. After a few minutes, students in one line are signaled to move down two spots while the other line stays in place. When new pairs are formed, the process repeats. \n\nAnother protocol you could try: \"Cross the line if…\" then the teacher calls out various visual and text effects to see which students tried out which. \n"
