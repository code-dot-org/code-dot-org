        "purpose": "In this lesson students will learn how information is represented in a way such that a computer can interpret and store it. When learning binary, students will have the opportunity to write codes and share them with peers as secret messages. This can then be related back to how computers read a program, translate it to binary, use the information in some way, then reply back in a way humans can understand. For example, when we type a sentence into a document then press save, a computer translates the sentence into binary, stores the information, then posts a message indicating the document has been saved.",

This opens up opportunities for online meanness to occur.\n\n**P**: Pause and think\n\n* _Would it be helpful to talk to the person who was being mean?_\n\n**Ask**: _What advice would you give Jada to respond to this situation?

If Jada and Michael are good friends, Jada may want to tell Michael how his actions made her feel, after she gets advice from an adult. If Michael continues to be mean to her, she should immediately tell an adult.\n\n**Ask**: _Which of the 4 rules in S-T-O-P do you think is the most important? Why?_\n\nGive students a moment to think and then informally poll the class.

This includes blurting out answers or pointing out when the robot has done something wrong.\n - Programmers should raise their hand if they see a bug.\n\n---\n\n\n### Differentiation Options:\n\n\n**Simplify:**  Does this all feel a little complicated for your students?  \n\nDon't forget to model this in front of the class until students understand all of the rules.

Do you want this lesson to relate more closely to the online puzzles? Here are some modifications that you can make:\n\n- One arrow corresponds to one movement:\n\t- When a cup is removed from the stack, it returns to table-level before moving.\n\t- Students need to use multiple \"up\" arrows to lift the cup multiple levels.\n\t- Students need to use multiple \"down\" arrows to lower the cups multiple levels.\n\t- Students need to use the \"back\" arrows to get back to the cup stack.\n\n"

A simple three cup pattern is a great place to start.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/image_29uZ9YD.png\" style=\"max-width: 300px; margin: 10px;\">\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: Show “List of Steps” slide\n\n**Prompt:** Ask the class what the first instruction should be, using only the four instructions allowed.

If they suggest something not from the list, make a clear malfunction reaction and let them know that the command is not understood.\n\nWith cup in hand, ask the class to continue giving you instructions until the first cup is placed. This is a great place to clarify that \"step forward\" and \"step backward\" each imply moving half a cup width. See the image below for reference.\n\n![3 cup pattern](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/image_d0bGRBl.png)\n\nContinue asking for instructions from the classroom until you have completed the entire design.\n\nOnce your stack is complete, point out that they just gave you a list of steps for completing a task. That's an algorithm.  Algorithms are great for sharing ideas, but spelling them out word by word can take a long time. That's what the symbols are for!  When you change an algorithm into symbols that a robot (or computer) understands, that's called programming.\n\n\nAsk the class to help you write the \"program\" for that first move by changing the text into an arrow. Then work with them to write down the rest of the moves necessary to complete the pattern. Depending on the confidence of your students, you might switch back and forth frequently between acting as the \"robot\" and writing down the code, or you might push them to write the whole program before you will implement it. \n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: Show “Answer Key” slide\n\n**Say:** _One possible solution looks like this:_\n\n![3 cup solution](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/image_xmBkoQZ_0OrQqsy.png)\n\n**Volunteer:** Once the class has completed the model program, ask one of the students to come up and act as the \"robot\" to ensure that the program really works.

During online activities, the role of the teacher is primarily one of encouragement and support. Online lessons are meant to be student-centered, so teachers should avoid stepping in when students get stuck. Some ideas on how to do this are: \n\n - Utilize pair programming whenever possible during the activity.\n - Encourage students with questions/challenges to start by asking their partner.\n - Unanswered questions can be escalated to a nearby group, who might already know the solution.\n - Remind students to use the debugging process before you approach.\n - Have students describe the problem that they’re seeing. What is it supposed to do? What does it do? What does that tell you?\n - Remind frustrated students that frustration is a step on the path to learning, and that persistence will pay off.\n - If a student is still stuck after all of this, ask leading questions to get the student to spot an error on their own.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Display**: Show “Discuss” slide\n\n**Discuss:** After providing students with end-of-class warnings, grab everyone's attention and get them to reflect on the experiences that they just had.\n\n - _Did anyone feel frustrated during any of the puzzles?_\n - _Did anyone notice the need to be persistent?_\n\n**Transition:** Have students take a moment to reflect on the lesson for themselves."

Give them 3-4 sounds and ask what buttons they would need to press to get the sounds to play in that order. For example:\n    - What buttons would you need to press to get \"Twist, Twist, Clap, Stomp\"?\n- To make things more challenging, get the class started on a separate task, then begin interrupting them again with the buttons. We suggest:\n\t- Counting to 10\n\t- Singing “Old MacDonald”\n- Practice until students seem comfortable with the idea that each button press causes them to perform an action."

As they do so, have them touch on what the planning-to-coding experience was like for them, including ideas they'd still like to implement. \n* **Pair Playtesting**: Have students or groups pair up and playtest each other's projects. As they do, ask them to provide positive and constructive feedback to each other. The benefit here is that students will have the opportunity to provide and respond to feedback in a smaller setting. \n* **Gallery Walk**: Ensure all students have their projects ready for testing. Have students move \"musical chairs\"-style to another computer and playtest the project there for a few minutes, until they receive a signal from you to move to another computer.
