  "content": "The `main` method in Java is arguably the most important method – it is the entry-point into any Java program. The syntax is the same for any Java program. The JVM (Java Virtual Machine) executes Java byte code, and the `main` method must have specific syntax for the JVM to identify it and execute its contents.\n\n###public static void main(String[] args)\n\n***public***: The method needs to be `public` for the JVM to identify it.\n\n***static***: `static` in this context means that there will be only one type of this method and that it will be shared. When we call the `main` method, it does not require a new instantiated object – it can be called without the creation of a new object. \n\n***void***: There is nothing returned from the `main` method.\n\n***main***: The general signature of the `main` method that is identified by the JVM to execute any program from start to finish. \n\n***String[] args***:  The `main` method's argument (or input parameter) is an array of type `String`. This allows the method to accept command line arguments, which are stored as `String`s in this variable. The name `args` can be changed.   ",
