  "content": "Java methods are blocks of code that are only executed when the specific method is called. Methods are extremely useful tools to reuse code, or break down a large task into smaller chunks.  Methods can accept a few parameters and return an object as well. Methods are oftentimes called functions. \n\n*There are two types of methods:*\n\n**1. User-defined Methods:** Methods we can create on our own to perform specific tasks.\n\n**2. Standard Library Methods:** Methods included in Java libraries for our use.\n\n###User-Defined Methods\n\n```\nmodifier static returnType methodName() {\n// method content\n}\n```\n*modifier:* the access type of the method, generally public or private. \n\n*static*: defines the nature of the method. if the method is static, it can be accessed without creating a new object of that class. \n\n*returnType:* defines the type of the value that the method will return. \n\n*methodName:* the name of the method. this will usually be descriptive of the task or operation that the method is performing.\n\n*method content:* the content and operations included within the method. \n\n###Standard Library Methods \nStandard library methods are built-in and they are embedded within the Java class in a Java archive (*.jar) file. \nA few examples: \n```\nprint() // from java.io.PrintStream\nsqrt() // from the Math class\n```\n",
