csa2025,1.1.A,1.1.A.1,Algorithms define step-by-step processes to follow when completing a task or solving a problem. These algorithms can be represented using written language or diagrams.
csa2025,1.1.A,1.1.A.2,Sequencing defines an order for when steps in a process are completed. Steps in a process are completed one at a time.
csa2025,1.1.B,1.1.B.1,"Code can be written in any text editor; however, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is often used to write programs because it provides tools for a programmer to write, compile, and run code."
csa2025,1.1.B,1.1.B.2,A compiler checks code for some errors. Errors detectable by the compiler need to be fixed before the program can be run.
csa2025,1.1.C,1.1.C.1,A syntax error is a mistake in the program where the rules of the programming language are not followed. These errors are detected by the compiler.
csa2025,1.1.C,1.1.C.2,A logic error is a mistake in the algorithm or program that causes it to behave incorrectly or unexpectedly. These errors are detected by testing the program with specific data to see if it produces the expected outcome.
csa2025,1.1.C,1.1.C.3,A run-time error is a mistake in the program that occurs during the execution of a program. Run-time errors typically cause the program to terminate abnormally.
csa2025,1.1.C,1.1.C.4,An exception is a type of run-time error that occurs as a result of an unexpected error that was not detected by the compiler. It interrupts the normal flow of the program’s execution.
csa2025,1.2.A,1.2.A.1,A data type is a set of values and a corresponding set of operations on those values. Data types can be categorized as either primitive or reference.
csa2025,1.2.A,1.2.A.2,The primitive data types used in this course define the set of values and corresponding operations on those values for numbers and Boolean values.
csa2025,1.2.A,1.2.A.3,A reference type is used to define objects that are not primitive types.
csa2025,1.2.B,1.2.B.1,"The three primitive data types used in this course are int, double, and boolean. An int value is an integer. A double value is a real number. A boolean value is either true or false.
EXCLUSION STATEMENT
The other five primitive data types (long, short, byte, float, and char) are outside the scope of the AP Computer Science A course and exam."
csa2025,1.2.B,1.2.B.2,"A variable is a storage location that holds a value, which can change while the program is running. Every variable has a name and an associated data type. A variable of a primitive type holds a primitive value from that type."
csa2025,1.3.A,1.3.A.1,"System.out.print and System.out.println display information on the computer display. System.out.println moves the cursor to a new line after the information has been displayed, while System.out.print does not."
csa2025,1.3.B,1.3.B.1,A literal is the code representation of a fixed value.
csa2025,1.3.B,1.3.B.2,A string literal is a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes.
csa2025,1.3.B,1.3.B.3,"Escape sequences are special sequences of characters that can be included in a string. They start with a \ and have a special meaning in Java. Escape sequences used in this course include double quote \"", backslash \\, and newline \n."
csa2025,1.3.C,1.3.C.1,"Arithmetic expressions, which consist of numeric values, variables, and operators, include expressions of type int and double."
csa2025,1.3.C,1.3.C.2,"The arithmetic operators consist of addition +, subtraction -, multiplication *, division /, and remainder (modulo) %. An arithmetic operation that uses two int values will evaluate to an int value. An arithmetic operation that uses at least one double value will evaluate to a double value.
EXCLUSION STATEMENT
Expressions that result in special double values (e.g., infinities and NaN) are outside the scope of the AP Computer Science A course and exam."
csa2025,1.3.C,1.3.C.3,"When dividing numeric values that are both int values, the result is only the integer portion of the quotient. When dividing numeric values that use at least one double value, the result is the quotient."
csa2025,1.3.C,1.3.C.4,"The remainder (modulo) operator % is used to compute the remainder when one number is divided by another number.
EXCLUSION STATEMENT
The use of values less than 0 for a and the use of values less than or equal to 0 for b is outside the scope of the AP Computer Science A course and exam."
csa2025,1.3.C,1.3.C.5,"Operators can be used to construct compound expressions. At compile time, numeric values are associated with operators according to operator precedence to determine how they are grouped. Parentheses can be used to modify operator precedence. Multiplication, division, and remainder (modulo) have precedence over addition and subtraction. Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left to right."
csa2025,1.3.C,1.3.C.6,"An attempt to divide an integer by the integer zero will result in an ArithmeticException.
EXCLUSION STATEMENT
The use of dividing by zero when one numeric value is a double is outside the scope of the AP Computer Science A course and exam."
csa2025,1.4.A,1.4.A.1,Every variable must be assigned a value before it can be used in an expression. That value must be from a compatible data type. A variable is initialized the first time it is assigned a value. Reference types can be assigned a new object or null if there is no object. The literal null is a special value used to indicate that a reference is not associated with any object.
csa2025,1.4.A,1.4.A.2,"The assignment operator = allows a program to initialize or change the value stored in a variable. The value of the expression on the right is stored in the variable on the left.
EXCLUSION STATEMENT
The use of assignment operators inside expressions (e.g., a = b = 4; or a[i += 5]) is outside the scope of the AP Computer Science A course and exam."
csa2025,1.4.A,1.4.A.3,"During execution, an expression is evaluated to produce a single value. The value of an expression has a type based on the evaluation of the expression."
csa2025,1.4.B,1.4.B.1,"Input can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text. The Scanner class is one way to obtain text input from the keyboard.
EXCLUSION STATEMENT
Any specific form of input from the user is outside the scope of the AP Computer Science A course and exam."
csa2025,1.5.A,1.5.A.1,The casting operators (int) and (double) can be used to convert from a double value to an int value (or vice versa).
csa2025,1.5.A,1.5.A.2,Casting a double value to an int value causes the digits to the right of the decimal point to be truncated.
csa2025,1.5.A,1.5.A.3,Some code causes int values to be automatically cast (widened) to double values.
csa2025,1.5.A,1.5.A.4,Values of type double can be rounded to the nearest integer by (int)(x + 0.5) for non-negative numbers or (int)(x – 0.5) for negative numbers.
csa2025,1.5.B,1.5.B.1,The constant Integer.MAX_VALUE holds the value of the largest possible int value. The constant Integer.MIN_VALUE holds the value of the smallest possible int value.
csa2025,1.5.B,1.5.B.2,"Integer values in Java are represented by values of type int, which are stored using a finite amount (4 bytes) of memory. Therefore, an int value must be in the range from Integer.MIN_VALUE to Integer.MAX_VALUE inclusive."
csa2025,1.5.B,1.5.B.3,"If an expression would evaluate to an int value outside of the allowed range, an integer overflow occurs. The result is an int value in the allowed range, but not necessarily the value expected."
csa2025,1.5.C,1.5.C.1,"Computers allot a specified amount of memory to store data based on the data type. If an expression would evaluate to a double that is more precise than can be stored in the allotted amount of memory, a round-off error occurs. The result will be rounded to the representable value. To avoid rounding errors that naturally occur, use int values.
EXCLUSION STATEMENT
Other special decimal data types that can be used to avoid rounding errors are outside the scope of the AP Computer Science A course and exam."
csa2025,1.6.A,1.6.A.1,"Compound assignment operators +=, -=, *=, /=, %= can be used in place of the assignment operator in numeric expressions. A compound assignment operator performs the indicated arithmetic operation between the value on the left and the value on the right and then assigns the result to the variable on the left."
csa2025,1.6.A,1.6.A.2,"The post-increment operator ++ and post-decrement operator -- are used to add 1 or subtract 1 from the stored value of a numeric variable. The new value is assigned to the variable.
EXCLUSION STATEMENT
The use of increment and decrement operators in prefix form (i.e., ++x) is outside the scope of the AP Computer Science A course and exam. The use of increment and decrement operators inside other expressions (i.e., arr[x++]) is outside the scope of the AP Computer Science A course and exam."
csa2025,1.7.A,1.7.A.1,Libraries are collections of classes. An Application Programming Interface (API) specification informs the programmer how to use those classes. Documentation found in API specifications and libraries is essential to understanding the attributes and behaviors of a class defined by the API. A class defines a specific reference type. Classes in the APIs and libraries are grouped into packages. Existing classes and class libraries can be utilized to create objects.
csa2025,1.7.A,1.7.A.2,Attributes refer to the data related to the class and are stored in variables. Behaviors refer to what instances of the class can do (or what can be done with it) and are defined by methods.
csa2025,1.8.A,1.8.A.1,"Comments are written for both the original programmer and other programmers to understand the code and its functionality, but are ignored by the compiler and are not executed when the program is run. Three types of comments in Java include /* */, which generates a block of comments, //, which generates a comment on one line, and /** */, which are Javadoc comments and are used to create API documentation."
csa2025,1.8.A,1.8.A.2,A precondition is a condition that must be true just prior to the execution of a method in order for it to behave as expected. There is no expectation that the method will check to ensure preconditions are satisfied.
csa2025,1.8.A,1.8.A.3,A postcondition is a condition that must always be true after the execution of a method. Postconditions describe the outcome of the execution in terms of what is being returned or the current value of the attributes of an object.
csa2025,1.9.A,1.9.A.1,A method is a named block of code that only runs when it is called. A block of code is any section of code that is enclosed in braces. Procedural abstraction allows a programmer to use a method by knowing what the method does even if they do not know how the method was written.
csa2025,1.9.A,1.9.A.2,A parameter is a variable declared in the header of a method or constructor and can be used inside the body of the method. This allows values or arguments to be passed and used by a method or constructor. A method signature for a method with parameters consists of the method name and the ordered list of parameter types. A method signature for a method without parameters consists of the method name and an empty parameter list.
csa2025,1.9.B,1.9.B.1,A void method does not have a return value and is therefore not called as part of an expression.
csa2025,1.9.B,1.9.B.2,"A non-void method returns a value that is the same type as the return type in the header. To use the return value when calling a non-void method, it must be stored in a variable or used as part of an expression."
csa2025,1.9.B,1.9.B.3,"An argument is a value that is passed into a method when the method is called. The arguments passed to a method must be compatible in number and order with the types identified in the parameter list of the method signature. When calling methods, arguments are passed using call by value. Call by value initializes the parameters with copies of the arguments."
csa2025,1.9.B,1.9.B.4,Methods are said to be overloaded when there are multiple methods with the same name but different signatures.
csa2025,1.9.B,1.9.B.5,"A method call interrupts the sequential execution of statements, causing the program to first execute the statements in the method before continuing. Once the last statement in the method has been executed or a return statement is executed, the flow of control is returned to the point immediately following where the method was called."
csa2025,1.10.A,1.10.A.1,"Class methods are associated with the class, not instances of the class. Class methods include the keyword static in the header before the method name."
csa2025,1.10.A,1.10.A.2,"Class methods are typically called using the class name along with the dot operator. When the method call occurs in the defining class, the use of the class name is optional in the call."
csa2025,1.11.A,1.11.A.1,The Math class is part of the java.lang package. Classes in the java.lang package are available by default.
csa2025,1.11.A,1.11.A.2,"The Math class contains only class methods. The following Math class methods—including what they do and when they are used—are part of the AP Java Quick Reference:
• static int abs(int x) returns the absolute value of an int value.
• static double abs(double x) returns the absolute value of a double value.
• static double pow(double base, double exponent) returns the value of the first parameter raised to the power of the second parameter.
• static double sqrt(double x) returns the positive square root of a double value.
• static double random() returns a double value greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0."
csa2025,1.11.A,1.11.A.3,"The values returned from Math.random() can be manipulated using arithmetic and casting operators to produce a random int or double in a defined range based on specified criteria. Each endpoint of the range can be inclusive, meaning the value is included, or exclusive, meaning the value is not included."
csa2025,1.12.A,1.12.A.1,"An object is a specific instance of a class with defined attributes. A class is the formal implementation, or blueprint, of the attributes and behaviors of an object."
csa2025,1.12.A,1.12.A.2,"A class hierarchy can be developed by putting common attributes and behaviors of related classes into a single class called a superclass. Classes that extend a superclass, called subclasses, can draw upon the existing attributes and behaviors of the superclass without replacing these in the code. This creates an inheritance relationship from the subclasses to the superclass.
EXCLUSION STATEMENT
Designing and implementing inheritance relationships are outside the scope of the AP Computer Science A course and exam."
csa2025,1.12.A,1.12.A.3,All classes in Java are subclasses of the Object class.
csa2025,1.12.B,1.12.B.1,"A variable of a reference type holds an object reference, which can be thought of as the memory address of that object."
csa2025,1.13.A,1.13.A.1,A class contains constructors that are called to create objects. They have the same name as the class.
csa2025,1.13.A,1.13.A.2,"A constructor signature consists of the constructor’s name, which is the same as the class name, and the ordered list of parameter types. The parameter list, in the header of a constructor, lists the types of the values that are passed and their variable names."
csa2025,1.13.A,1.13.A.3,Constructors are said to be overloaded when there are multiple constructors with different signatures.
csa2025,1.13.B,1.13.B.1,"A variable of a reference type holds an object reference or, if there is no object, null."
csa2025,1.13.C,1.13.C.1,An object is typically created using the keyword new followed by a call to one of the class’s constructors.
csa2025,1.13.C,1.13.C.2,Parameters allow constructors to accept values to establish the initial values of the attributes of the object.
csa2025,1.13.C,1.13.C.3,"A constructor argument is a value that is passed into a constructor when the constructor is called. The arguments passed to a constructor must be compatible in order and number with the types identified in the parameter list in the constructor signature. When calling constructors, arguments are passed using call by value. Call by value initializes the parameters with copies of the arguments."
csa2025,1.13.C,1.13.C.4,"A constructor call interrupts the sequential execution of statements, causing the program to first execute the statements in the constructor before continuing. Once the last statement in the constructor has been executed, the flow of control is returned to the point immediately following where the constructor was called."
csa2025,1.14.A,1.14.A.1,Instance methods are called on objects of the class. The dot operator is used along with the object name to call instance methods.
csa2025,1.14.A,1.14.A.2,A method call on a null reference will result in a NullPointerException.
csa2025,1.15.A,1.15.A.1,A String object represents a sequence of characters and can be created by using a string literal.
csa2025,1.15.A,1.15.A.2,The String class is part of the java.lang package. Classes in the java.lang package are available by default.
csa2025,1.15.A,1.15.A.3,"A String object is immutable, meaning once a String object is created, its attributes cannot be changed. Methods called on a String object do not change the content of the String object."
csa2025,1.15.A,1.15.A.4,"Two String objects can be concatenated together or combined using the + or += operator, resulting in a new String object. A primitive value can be concatenated with a String object. This causes the implicit conversion of the primitive value to a String object."
csa2025,1.15.A,1.15.A.5,"A String object can be concatenated with any object, which implicitly calls the object’s toString method (a behavior which is guaranteed to exist by the inheritance relationship every class has with the Object class). An object’s toString method returns a string value representing the object. Subclasses of Object often override the toString method with class-specific implementation. Method overriding occurs when a public method in a subclass has the same method signature as a public method in the superclass, but the behavior of the method is specific to the subclass.
EXCLUSION STATEMENT
Overriding the toString method of a class is outside the scope of the AP Computer Science A course and exam."
csa2025,1.15.B,1.15.B.1,A String object has index values from 0 to one less than the length of the string. Attempting to access indices outside this range will result in an IndexOutOfBoundsException.
csa2025,1.15.B,1.15.B.2,"The following String methods—including what they do and when they are used—are part of the AP Java Quick Reference:
• int length() returns the number of characters in a String object.
• String substring(int from, int to) returns the substring beginning at index from and ending at index to – 1.
• String substring(int from) returns substring(from, length()).
• int indexOf(String str) returns the index of the first occurrence of str; returns -1 if not found.
• boolean equals(Object other) returns true if this corresponds to the same sequence of characters as other; returns false otherwise.
• int compareTo(String other) returns a value < 0 if this is less than other; returns zero if this is equal to other; returns a value > 0 if this is greater than other. Strings are ordered based upon the alphabet.
EXCLUSION STATEMENT
Using the equals method to compare one String object with an object of a type other than String is outside the scope of the AP Computer Science A course and exam."
csa2025,1.15.B,1.15.B.3,"A string identical to the single element substring at position index can be created by calling substring(index, index + 1)."
csa2025,2.1.A,2.1.A.1,"The building blocks of algorithms include sequencing, selection, and repetition."
csa2025,2.1.A,2.1.A.2,"Algorithms can contain selection, through decision-making, and repetition, via looping."
csa2025,2.1.A,2.1.A.3,Selection occurs when a choice of how the execution of an algorithm will proceed is based on a true or false decision.
csa2025,2.1.A,2.1.A.4,Repetition is when a process repeats itself until a desired outcome is reached.
csa2025,2.1.A,2.1.A.5,"The order in which sequencing, selection, and repetition are used contributes to the outcome of the algorithm."
csa2025,2.2.A,2.2.A.1,"Values can be compared using the relational operators == and != to determine whether the values are the same. With primitive types, this compares the actual primitive values. With reference types, this compares the object references."
csa2025,2.2.A,2.2.A.2,"Numeric values can be compared using the relational operators <, >, <=, and >= to determine the relationship between the values."
csa2025,2.2.A,2.2.A.3,An expression involving relational operators evaluates to a Boolean value.
csa2025,2.3.A,2.3.A.1,Selection statements change the sequential execution of statements.
csa2025,2.3.A,2.3.A.2,An if statement is a type of selection statement that affects the flow of control by executing different segments of code based on the value of a Boolean expression.
csa2025,2.3.A,2.3.A.3,"A one-way selection (if statement) is used when there is a segment of code to execute under a certain condition. In this case, the body is executed only when the Boolean expression is true."
csa2025,2.3.A,2.3.A.4,"A two-way selection (if-else statement) is used when there are two segments of code—one to be executed when the Boolean expression is true, and another segment for when the Boolean expression is false. In this case, the body of the if is executed when the Boolean expression is true, and the body of the else is executed when the Boolean expression is false."
csa2025,2.4.A,2.4.A.1,"Nested if statements consist of if, if-else, or if-else-if statements within if, if-else, or if-else-if statements."
csa2025,2.4.A,2.4.A.2,The Boolean expression of the inner nested if statement is evaluated only if the Boolean expression of the outer if statement evaluates to true.
csa2025,2.4.A,2.4.A.3,"A multi-way selection (if-else-if) is used when there are a series of expressions with different segments of code for each condition. Multi-way selection is performed such that no more than one segment of code is executed based on the first expression that evaluates to true. If no expression evaluates to true and there is a trailing else statement, then the body of the else is executed."
csa2025,2.5.A,2.5.A.1,"Logical operators ! (not), && (and), and || (or) are used with Boolean expressions. The expression !a evaluates to true if a is false and evaluates to false otherwise. The expression a && b evaluates to true if both a and b are true and evaluates to false otherwise. The expression a || b evaluates to true if a is true, b is true, or both, and evaluates to false otherwise. The order of precedence for evaluating logical operators is ! (not), && (and), then || (or). An expression involving logical operators evaluates to a Boolean value."
csa2025,2.5.A,2.5.A.2,"Short-circuit evaluation occurs when the result of a logical operation using && or || can be determined by evaluating only the first Boolean expression. In this case, the second Boolean expression is not evaluated."
csa2025,2.6.A,2.6.A.1,Two Boolean expressions are equivalent if they evaluate to the same value in all cases. Truth tables can be used to prove Boolean expressions are equivalent.
csa2025,2.6.A,2.6.A.2,"De Morgan’s Law can be applied to Boolean expressions to create equivalent Boolean expressions. Under De Morgan’s Law, the Boolean expression !(a && b) is equivalent to !a || !b and the Boolean expression !(a || b) is equivalent to !a && !b."
csa2025,2.6.A,2.6.B.1,"Two different variables can hold references to the same object. Object references can be compared, using == and !=."
csa2025,2.6.B,2.6.B.2,"An object reference can be compared with null, using == or !=, to determine if the reference actually references an object."
csa2025,2.6.B,2.6.B.3,"Often classes define their own equals method, which can be used to specify the criteria for equivalency for two objects of the class. The equivalency of two objects is most often determined using attributes from the two objects.
EXCLUSION STATEMENT
Overriding the equals method is outside the scope of the AP Computer Science A course and exam."
csa2025,2.7.A,2.7.A.1,Iteration is a form of repetition. Iteration statements change the flow of control by repeating a segment of code zero or more times as long as the Boolean expression controlling the loop evaluates to true.
csa2025,2.7.A,2.7.A.2,An infinite loop occurs when the Boolean expression in an iterative statement always evaluates to true.
csa2025,2.7.A,2.7.A.3,The loop body of an iterative statement will not execute if the Boolean expression initially evaluates to false.
csa2025,2.7.A,2.7.A.4,"""Off by one"" errors occur when the iteration statement loops one time too many or one time too few."
csa2025,2.7.B,2.7.B.1,"A while loop is a type of iterative statement. In while loops, the Boolean expression is evaluated before each iteration of the loop body, including the first. When the expression evaluates to true, the loop body is executed. This continues until the Boolean expression evaluates to false, whereupon the iteration terminates."
csa2025,2.8.A,2.8.A.1,"A for loop is a type of iterative statement. There are three parts in a for loop header—the initialization, the Boolean expression, and the update."
csa2025,2.8.A,2.8.A.2,"In a for loop, the initialization statement is only executed once before the first Boolean expression evaluation. The variable being initialized is referred to as a loop control variable. The Boolean expression is evaluated immediately after the loop control variable is initialized and then followed by each execution of the increment statement until it is false. In each iteration, the update is executed after the entire loop body is executed and before the Boolean expression is evaluated again."
csa2025,2.8.A,2.8.A.3,A for loop can be rewritten into an equivalent while loop (and vice versa).
csa2025,2.9.A,2.9.A.1,"There are standard algorithms to
• identify if an integer is or is not evenly divisible by another integer.
• identify the individual digits in an integer.
• determine the frequency with which a specific criterion is met.
• determine a minimum or maximum value.
• compute a sum or average."
csa2025,2.10.A,2.10.A.1,"There are standard string algorithms to
• find if one or more substrings have a particular property.
• determine the number of substrings that meet specific criteria.
• create a new string with the characters."
csa2025,2.11.A,2.11.A.1,"Nested iteration statements are iteration statements that appear in the body of another iteration statement. When a loop is nested inside another loop, the inner loop must complete all its iterations before the outer loop can continue to its next iteration."
csa2025,2.12.A,2.12.A.1,A statement execution count indicates the number of times a statement is executed by the program. Statement execution counts are often calculated informally through tracing and analysis of the iterative statements.
csa2025,3.1.A,3.1.A.1,"Abstraction is the process of reducing complexity by focusing on the main idea. By hiding details irrelevant to the question at hand and bringing together related and useful details, abstraction reduces complexity and allows one to focus on the idea."
csa2025,3.1.A,3.1.A.2,"Data abstraction provides a separation between the abstract properties of a data type and the concrete details of its representation. Data abstraction manages complexity by giving data a name without referencing the specific details of the representation. Data can take the form of a single variable or a collection of data, such as in a class or a set of data."
csa2025,3.1.A,3.1.A.3,An attribute is a type of data abstraction that is defined in a class outside any method or constructor. An instance variable is an attribute whose value is unique to each instance of the class. A class variable is an attribute shared by all instances of the class.
csa2025,3.1.A,3.1.A.4,"Procedural abstraction provides a name for a process and allows a method to be used only knowing what it does, not how it does it. Through method decomposition, a programmer breaks down larger behaviors of the class into smaller behaviors by creating methods to represent each individual smaller behavior. A procedural abstraction may extract shared features to generalize functionality instead of duplicating code. This allows for code reuse, which helps manage complexity."
csa2025,3.1.A,3.1.A.5,"Using parameters allows procedures to be generalized, enabling the procedures to be reused with a range of input values or arguments."
csa2025,3.1.A,3.1.A.6,"Using procedural abstraction in a program allows programmers to change the internals of a method (to make it faster, more efficient, use less storage, etc.) without needing to notify method users of the change as long as the method signature and what the method does is preserved."
csa2025,3.1.A,3.1.A.7,"Prior to implementing a class, it is helpful to take time to design each class including its attributes and behaviors. This design can be represented using natural language or diagrams."
csa2025,3.2.A,3.2.A.1,System reliability refers to the program being able to perform its tasks as expected under stated conditions without failure. Programmers should make an effort to maximize system reliability by testing the program with a variety of conditions.
csa2025,3.2.A,3.2.A.2,"The creation of programs has impacts on society, economies, and culture. These impacts can be both beneficial and harmful. Programs meant to fill a need or solve a problem can have unintended harmful effects beyond their intended use."
csa2025,3.2.A,3.2.A.3,Legal issues and intellectual property concerns arise when creating programs. Programmers often reuse code written by others and published as open source and free to use. Incorporation of code that is not published as open source requires the programmer to obtain permission and often purchase the code before integrating it into their program.
csa2025,3.2.B,3.2.B.1,Artificial intelligence is the simulation of intelligent behavior by a computer system or algorithm. The use of artificial intelligence when developing code may decrease the amount of time it takes to develop code.

csa2025,3.3.A,3.3.A.1,"Data encapsulation is a technique in which the implementation details of a class are kept hidden from external classes. The keywords public and private affect the access of classes, data, constructors, and methods. The keyword private restricts access to the declaring class, while the keyword public allows access from classes outside the declaring class."
csa2025,3.3.A,3.3.A.2,"In this course, classes are always designated public and are declared with the keyword class."
csa2025,3.3.A,3.3.A.3,"In this course, constructors are always designated public."

csa2025,3.3.A,3.3.A.5,"Access to attributes should be kept internal to the class in order to accomplish encapsulation. Therefore, it is good programming practice to designate the instance variables for these attributes as private unless the class specification states otherwise."
csa2025,3.3.A,3.3.A.6,Access to behaviors can be internal or external to the class. Methods designated as public can be accessed internally or externally to a class whereas methods designated as private can only be accessed internally to the class.
csa2025,3.4.A,3.4.A.1,An object’s state refers to its attributes and their values at a given time and is defined by instance variables belonging to the object. This defines a “has-a” relationship between the object and its instance variables.
csa2025,3.4.A,3.4.A.2,"A constructor is used to set the initial state of an object, which should include initial values for all instance variables. When a constructor is called, memory is allocated for the object and the associated object reference is returned. Constructor parameters, if specified, provide data to initialize instance variables."
csa2025,3.4.A,3.4.A.3,"When a mutable object is a constructor parameter, the instance variable should be initialized with a copy of the referenced object. In this way, the instance variable does not hold a reference to the original object, and methods are prevented from modifying the state of the original object."
csa2025,3.4.A,3.4.A.4,"When no constructor is written, Java provides a no-parameter constructor, and the instance variables are set to default values according to the data type of the attribute. This constructor is called the default constructor."
csa2025,3.4.A,3.4.A.5,The default value for an attribute of type int is 0. The default value of an attribute of type double is 0.0. The default value of an attribute of type boolean is false. The default value of a reference type is null.
csa2025,3.5.A,3.5.A.1,A void method does not return a value. Its header contains the keyword void before the method name.
csa2025,3.5.A,3.5.A.2,A non-void method returns a single value. Its header includes the return type in place of the keyword void.
csa2025,3.5.A,3.5.A.3,"In non-void methods, a return expression compatible with the return type is evaluated, and the value is returned. This is referred to as ""return by value."""
csa2025,3.5.A,3.5.A.4,The return keyword is used to return the flow of control to the point where the method or constructor was called. Any code that is sequentially after a return statement will never be executed. Executing a return statement inside a selection or iteration statement will halt the statement and exit the method or constructor.
csa2025,3.5.A,3.5.A.5,An accessor method allows objects of other classes to obtain a copy of the value of instance variables or class variables. An accessor method is a non-void method.

csa2025,3.5.A,3.5.A.8,"When an argument is a primitive value, the parameter is initialized with a copy of that value. Changes to the parameter have no effect on the corresponding argument."
csa2025,3.6.A,3.6.A.1,"When an argument is an object reference, the parameter is initialized with a copy of that reference; it does not create a new independent copy of the object. If the parameter refers to a mutable object, the method or constructor can use this reference to alter the state of the object. It is good programming practice to not modify mutable objects that are passed as parameters unless required in the specification."
csa2025,3.6.A,3.6.A.2,"When the return expression evaluates to an object reference, the reference is returned, not a reference to a new copy of the object."
csa2025,3.6.A,3.6.A.3,Methods cannot access the private data and methods of a parameter that holds a reference to an object unless the parameter is the same type as the method’s enclosing class.

csa2025,3.7.B,3.7.B.1,"Class variables belong to the class, with all objects of a class sharing a single copy of the class variable. Class variables are designated with the static keyword before the variable type."
csa2025,3.7.B,3.7.B.2,"Class variables that are designated public are accessed outside of the class by using the class name and the dot operator, since they are associated with a class, not objects of a class."
csa2025,3.7.B,3.7.B.3,"When a variable is declared final, its value cannot be modified."
csa2025,3.8.A,3.8.A.1,"Local variables are variables declared in the headers or bodies of blocks of code. Local variables can only be accessed in the block in which they are declared. Since constructors and methods are blocks of code, parameters to constructors or methods are also considered local variables. These variables may only be used within the constructor or method and cannot be declared to be public or private."
csa2025,3.8.A,3.8.A.2,"When there is a local variable or parameter with the same name as an instance variable, the variable name will refer to the local variable instead of the instance variable within the body of the constructor or method."
csa2025,3.9.A,3.9.A.1,"Within an instance method or a constructor, the keyword this acts as a special variable that holds a reference to the current object—the object whose method or constructor is being called."
csa2025,3.9.A,3.9.A.2,The keyword this can be used to pass the current object as an argument in a method call.
csa2025,4.1.A,4.1.A.1,"When using a computer, personal privacy is at risk. When developing new programs, programmers should attempt to safeguard personal privacy of the user. Personal data can be kept secure by ensuring that attributes are encapsulated and unable to be accessed or modified outside the class."

csa2025,4.6.A,4.6.A.4,"When using the File class, it is required to indicate what to do if the file with the provided name cannot be opened. One way to accomplish this is to add throws IOException to the header of the method that uses the file. If the file name is invalid, the program will terminate."
csa2025,4.6.A,4.6.A.5,The File and IOException classes are part of the java.io package. An import statement must be used to make these classes available for use in the program.
