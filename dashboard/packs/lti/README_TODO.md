Welcome to `packs/lti`!

If you're the author, please consider replacing this file with a README.md, which may contain:
- What your pack is and does
- How you expect people to use your pack
- Example usage of your pack's public API (which lives in `packs/lti/app/public`)
- Limitations, risks, and important considerations of usage
- How to get in touch with eng and other stakeholders for questions or issues pertaining to this pack (note: it is recommended to add ownership in `packs/lti/package.yml` under the `owner` metadata key)
- What SLAs/SLOs (service level agreements/objectives), if any, your package provides
- When in doubt, keep it simple
- Anything else you may want to include!

README.md files are under version control and should change as your public API changes. 

See https://github.com/rubyatscale/packs#readme for more info!
