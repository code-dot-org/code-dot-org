# Simple script for creating TTS audio files for some of our clientside
# feedback strings and UI elements; all those strings for which we
# generate the TTS URL clientside rather than somewhere in dashboard.

# TODO: (elijah) consider integrating this into the sync-codeout-out
# script

# TODO: (elijah) formalize a process for flagging these strings somewhere
# in apps code, rather than maintaining this ugly manual Hash
