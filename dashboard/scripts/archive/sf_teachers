#
# is it easy to query to find how many teachers we have with accounts
# @sfusd.edu, and if any have a reasonably-sized classroom or student
# progress?
#
# ideal would be a list of teacher names with @sfusd.edu accounts,
# number of students in their classroom, and some number suggesting
# their progress (eg sum of puzzles solved by their students, or
# number of trophies achieved, etc, or the summary "On average your
# students have earned 6.5 out of 27 Concept Mastery trophies.")

sf_teachers = User.where("email like '%@sfusd.edu'")
data = sf_teachers.collect do |u|
  average_completed_levels = 0
  unless u.followers.empty?
    completed_levels = u.followers.collect(&:student_user).collect {|student| student.user_levels.where('best_result > 20').count}
    average_completed_levels = completed_levels.inject(&:+).to_f / completed_levels.size
    average_completed_levels = average_completed_levels.round(2)
  end

  [u.email, u.name, u.followers.count, average_completed_levels].join(', ')
end

puts "Email, Name, Number of students, Average # of completed levels"
puts data.join("\n")
