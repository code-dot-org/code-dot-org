require 'cdo/delete_accounts_helper'

#
# Responsible for performing unrecoverable deletion of PII from our system.
#
# Built defensively:
# All database changes occur within a transaction, and we predetermine
# acceptable affected row counts for each step.  If any query exceeds the
# acceptable number of affected rows we roll back the transaction and move the
# account into a manual review queue where an engineer will handle it.
# Changes that occur outside of the database (removing content from S3)
# all occurs after point-of-no-return after the transaction successfully
# commits.
#
# Pushes audit logs to S3.
