# This module is the entry point for all "Curriculum PDFs", referring to the
# PDFs that we automatically generate from our teacher-facing Lesson Plans and
# related content.
#
# Note that, following Rails convention, this file defines the basic structure
# of the module but most of the logic lives in the submodules, as defined in
# the various other files in the `curriculum_pdfs/` directory.
#
# Currently (as of September 2021), we generate the following kind of PDFs:
#
# - Teacher-facing Lesson Plans (for example, https://lesson-plans.code.org/csp1-2021/20210826162223/teacher-lesson-plans/Welcome+to+CSP.pdf)
# - Student-facing Lesson Plans (for example, https://lesson-plans.code.org/csp1-2021/20210826162223/student-lesson-plans/Welcome+to+CSP.pdf)
# - Script Overviews (for example, https://lesson-plans.code.org/csp1-2021/20210826162223/Digital+Information+('21-'22).pdf)
# - Script Resource Rollups (for example, https://lesson-plans.code.org/csp1-2021/20210826162223/Digital+Information+('21-'22)+-+Resources.pdf)
#
# We may also want in the future to generate more kinds, including:
#
# - student resources, based on Resource#audience
# - unit calendar
# - four rollup pages for unit, unit group, one for each of:
#   - vocab
#   - resouces
#   - standards
#   - programming expressions
#
# Our overall approach for PDF generation is as follows:
#
# When lesson plan is updated on levelbuilder, we serialize it into a
# `.script_json` file. As part of that serialization we record a timestamp of
# the update, then when that file is then seeded on the staging machine, we
# compare the timestamp to the last known value; if we detect that any content
# in the entire `.script_json` file has been updated, we regenerate all PDFs
# for the associated script.
#

#
# PDFs are generated by puppeteer. Specifically, all content that is going to
# be converted into a PDF is built with CSS print styles as well as web-view
# styling, and we simply print the page to PDF with headless Chrome.
#
# This has two notable implications:
#
# First, it means that anyone (including teachers) can generate their own PDFs
# by simply printing the page from their own browser. This is intentional; by
# relying exclusively on standard browser implementations for page rendering
# and printing, we can be confident this functionality will work in a variety
# of situations.
#
# Second, it means that we can only render PDFs of pages that are visible to
# signed-out users, as they appear to signed-out users. This is NOT
# intentional, but is a product of the fact that the headless Chrome session we
# use to render the pages does not have user authentication information
# associated with it.
#
# After generating all PDFs on the staging machine during the staging build,
# PDFs are uploaded to S3. They're labeled with the relevant timestamp and
# served directly from S3, which allows us to generate the files once as part
# of the build and then serve them from all of our various environments without
# worrying about version mismatch. Note that this does mean that we preserve
# all generated PDFs indefinitely, which will eventually mean we're storing a
# bunch of outdated files on S3.

    # Whether or not we should generate PDFs. Specifically, this
    # encapsulates three concerns:
    #
    # 1. Is this code running on the staging server? We only want to do this
    #    as part of the staging build; the generated PDFs will be made
    #    available to other environments, so they don't need to run this
    #    process themselves.
    # 2. Is the script one for which we care about PDFs? Right now, we only
    #    want to generate PDFs for "migrated" scripts.
    # 3. Is the script actually being updated? The overall seed process is
    #    indiscriminate, and will happily re-seed content even without
    #    changes. This is fine for database upserts, but we want to be more
    #    cautious with the more-expensive PDFs generation process.
    #
    # In addition, we support manually disabling this feature with DCDO
