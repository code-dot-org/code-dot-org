    # 1. Is this code running on the staging server? We only want to do this
    #    as part of the staging build; the generated PDFs will be made
    #    available to other environments, so they don't need to run this
    #    process themselves.
    # 2. Is the script one for which we care about PDFs? Right now, we only
    #    want to generate PDFs for "migrated" scripts.
    # 3. Is the script actually being updated? The overall seed process is
    #    indiscriminate, and will happily re-seed content even without
    #    changes. This is fine for database upserts, but we want to be more
    #    cautious with the more-expensive PDFs generation process.
