# As part of our Amazon Future Engineer partnership, teachers at eligible
# schools are offered a free CSTA+ membership. Our system expedites this
# process by automatically creating a submission to CSTA's enrollment form
# on the teacher's behalf.
#
# The CSTA form runs on JotForm, and we are using JotForm's public API to
# create new form submissions.  CSTA has provided us with a form ID and API key.
# See: https://api.jotform.com/docs/#post-form-id-submissions
