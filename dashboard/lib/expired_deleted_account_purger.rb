#
# Locates accounts that were soft-deleted more than <n> days ago and
# performs a hard-delete on those accounts, permanently removing the account
# data from our system.  Adds accounts to manual review queue if an automatic
# delete encounters problems or exceeds some safety limit.
#
# Sends metrics to Cloudwatch:
# - Number of soft-deleted accounts in system
# - Number of accounts purged
# - Number of accounts queued for manual review
# - Depth of manual review queue
#
# Logs activity to Slack #cron-daily room.
