# Wrapper for JotForms REST API.
# JotForm (jotform.com) is a 3rd party form / survey provider we're using for certain forms.
# API docs: https://api.jotform.com/docs/
#
# Note - while JotForm does provide a Ruby API client (https://github.com/jotform/jotform-api-ruby),
# it's very minimal and doesn't support the filter param we need to query submissions.
