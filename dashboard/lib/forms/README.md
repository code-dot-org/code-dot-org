# Form Objects

The Form Object pattern separates form-related logic and validations into dedicated objects,
streamlining complex form interactions and enhancing code maintainability.

**Note:** Form Objects declared in this directory should all be declared under the `Forms` namespace.

## Use Cases
- **Multi-Model Forms:** When a single form needs to create or update data across multiple models, Form Objects can encapsulate all the related logic and validations, simplifying complex interactions.
- **Complex Validations:** For forms that require validations that aren't directly tied to a single model or that involve several fields in complex ways (like conditional validations), Form Objects provide a neat way to manage these without cluttering the models.
- **Form-specific Business Logic:** When a form involves specific business rules or workflows (like a multi-step registration process), Form Objects can handle these intricacies, keeping the controller and model cleaner.
- **Custom Transactional Behaviors:** If a form's data processing needs custom transactional control (ensuring that certain conditions are met before data is saved), Form Objects can manage these transactions effectively.
- **Reusable Form Logic:** When similar forms are used in different parts of an application, a Form Object can be designed to be reusable, reducing redundancy and enhancing consistency.
