# The ssl_certificate library provided in the Supermarket is incompatible with
# modern versions of Chef.
# See https://github.com/zuazo/ssl_certificate-cookbook/issues/45.
# Instead, we depend on the as-yet-unmerged fix
# (https://github.com/zuazo/ssl_certificate-cookbook/pull/46) by vzDevelopment
# (forked to our own project purely to ensure stability).
