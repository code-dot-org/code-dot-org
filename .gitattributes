# Git LFS inclusion / exclusion is controlled by this file. Our approach is to:
# INCLUDE dirs in Git LFS broadly, and then EXCLUDE text file-types narrowly.
#
# Why include in LFS broadly? Once a large binary file is comitted without lfs,
# it is VERY hard to remove it from the git history as it requires a history
# rewrite. This cannot be done without major disruption to all devs. Thus,
# once merged to `staging`, that NNN MB file that missed LFS makes our git repo
# that much bigger forever.
#
# In contrast, if a text file (= a file that you want to be able to diff)
# is accidentally included in LFS, adding it back to git is easy,
# see: "HOW TO EXCLUDE A FILE/FILES THATS IN AN LFS DIR" below.

# INCLUDE these "large static asset" and localisation dirs in Git LFS:
apps/i18n/** filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
apps/static/** filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
dashboard/app/assets/** filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
dashboard/config/locales/** filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
dashboard/public/** filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
i18n/locales/** filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
pegasus/cache/i18n/** filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
pegasus/sites.v3/** filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
pegasus/sites/** filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
shared/images/** filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text

# HOW TO EXCLUDE A FILE/FILES FROM GIT LFS:
#
# 1. Add a new exclusion pattern in the immediately following section
# 2. Run `git add --renormalize .` from the root of the repo
# 3. All files matching the pattern should show up new and uncommitted
# 4. Commit your .gitattributes changes and the new files.
#
# 🙏 be thoughtful when adding new files/patterns: once the files
# are in our git history, they take up space forever.

# EXCLUDE these files from our Git LFS dirs:
