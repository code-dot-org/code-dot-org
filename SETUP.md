# Setup

This document describes how to set up your workstation to develop for Code.org.

You can do Code.org development using OSX, Ubuntu, or Windows (running Ubuntu in a VM). Setup for Windows is more complicated and relatively few developers use it. Make sure you follow the instructions for your platform in the subsections below.

## Overview

1. Request and Configure AWS access (code.org staff) or configure local secrets (open source contributors). See [Configure AWS Access or Secrets](#configure-aws-access-or-secrets) below. This step is not required until rake is first run below, but staff may wish to submit the request first so its ready when rake is.

1. Install OS-specific prerequisites
   - See the appropriate section below: [macOS](#macos), [Ubuntu](#ubuntu-1804-download-iso), [Windows](#windows)
   - *Important*: When done, check for correct versions of these dependencies:

     ```sh
     ruby --version  # --> ruby 3.0.5
     node --version  # --> v18.16.0
     yarn --version  # --> 1.22.5
     ```

1. If using SSH (recommended): `git clone git@github.com:code-dot-org/code-dot-org.git` , if using HTTPS: `git clone https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org.git`

1. `cd code-dot-org`

1. `gem install bundler -v 2.3.22`

1. `rbenv rehash`

1. `bundle config --local without staging test production levelbuilder`

1. `bundle install`
    - This step often fails to due environment-specific issues. Look in the [Bundle Install Tips](#bundle-install-tips) section below for steps to resolve many common issues.

1. `bundle exec rake install:hooks`
    <details>
      <summary>Troubleshoot: `rake aborted! Gem::LoadError: You have already activated...` </summary>

      - If you have issue `"rake aborted! Gem::LoadError: You have already activated rake 12.3.0, but your Gemfile requires rake 11.3.0."`, make sure you add `bundle exec` in front of the `rake install:hooks` command
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Troubleshoot: wrong version of rake </summary>

      - You might get a message at some point about having the wrong version of rake. If so, try:

        ```sh
        gem uninstall rake
        bundle update rake
        ```

    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Troubleshoot: `FrozenError: can't modify frozen String...Aws::Errors::MissingCredentialsError` or similar `Aws::SecretsManager` errors</summary>
      Reported when missing credentials for access to our AWS Account or local secret configuration.

      See [Configure AWS Access or Secrets](#configure-aws-access-or-secrets)
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Troubleshoot: `WSL: Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock'` </summary>

      - This is an issue specific to Windows System for Linux (WSL) OS configuration where connection to mysql without sudo would fail with the above error. This can be rectified with some permission updates on mysql files and updating SQL client side configuration as called out [in this SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66949451)
    </details>

1. `bundle exec rake install`
    - This can take a long time, ~30 minutes or more. The most expensive are the "seeding" tasks, where your local DB is populated from data in the repository. Some of the seeding rake tasks can take several minutes. The longest one, `seed:scripts`, can take > 10 minutes, but it should at least print out progress as it goes.

1. fix your database charset and collation to match our servers
    - `bin/dashboard-sql`
    - `ALTER DATABASE dashboard_development CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;`
    - `ALTER DATABASE dashboard_test CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;`

1. `bundle exec rake build`
    - This may fail if you are on a Mac and your OSX XCode Command Line Tools were not installed properly. See [Bundle Install Tips](#bundle-install-tips) for more information.
    - This may fail for external contributors who don't have permissions to access Code.org AWS Secrets. Assign placeholder values to any configuration settings that are [ordinarily populated in Development environments from AWS Secrets](https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org/blob/staging/config/development.yml.erb) as indicated in this example: https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org/blob/5b3baed4a9c2e7226441ca4492a3bca23a4d7226/locals.yml.default#L136-L139

1. Run the website `bin/dashboard-server`

1. Visit <http://localhost-studio.code.org:3000/> to verify it is running.

1. Install necessary plugins described in the [Editor configuration](#editor-configuration) section below.

After setup, read about our [code styleguide](./STYLEGUIDE.md), our [test suites](./TESTING.md), or find more docs on [the wiki](https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org/wiki/For-Developers).

## Configure AWS Access or Secrets

### For Code.org Staff

Staff should see instructions for requesting AWS account access in our "AWS Account Access" doc linked from "Getting started as a Developer", and follow the setup steps in the "API access (for local development)" section.
Some functionality will not work on your local site without this, for example, some project-backed level types such as <https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab>. 
### For external contributors

External contributors can supply alternate placeholder values for secrets normally retrieved from AWS Secrets Manager by creating a file named "locals.yml", copying contents from ["locals.yml.default"](locals.yml.default) and uncommenting following configurations to use placeholder values
          - slack_bot_token: localoverride
          - pardot_private_key: localoverride
          - firebase_secret: localoverride
          - firebase_shared_secret: localoverride
          - properties_encryption_key: localoverride

## OS-specific prerequisites

### macOS

These steps are for Apple devices running **macOS Monterey and Ventura**, including those running on [Apple Silicon (M1|M2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_silicon#M_series). 

Notes:
- At this time, if you are using an M1 Macbook, we recommend using Rosetta to set up an Intel-based development environment vs. trying to make things work with the ARM-based Apple Silicon environment.
- These steps may need to change over time as 3rd party tools update to have versions compatible with the new architecture.
- As macOS Catalina is no longer receiving security updates, we cannot recommend using it. If you still need support, see [old setup.md instructions for Catalina](https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org/blob/138d08a6f304c289e2b4388f513d81954ec85158/SETUP.md#os-x-catalina)

Setup steps for macOS:

1. _(M1 Mac users only)_ Install Rosetta 2.

  - Check if Rosetta is already installed: `/usr/bin/pgrep -q oahd && echo Yes || echo No`
  - If not, install Rosetta using
    - `softwareupdate --install-rosetta` (launches the Rosetta installer) or
    - `/usr/sbin/softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license` (skips installer and license agreement)
  - Follow these steps to enable Rosetta:
    - Select the app (Terminal) in Finder from Applications/Utilities.
    - Right-click on the app (Terminal) and select `Get Info`.
    - In `General`, check the `Open using Rosetta` checkbox.
    - Close the Terminal and open it again.
    - To verify that you are using a Rosetta terminal, run the command `arch` from the command line and it should output `i386`. The native terminal without Rosetta would output `arm64` for the above command. If you still do not see `i386` in the terminal then try restarting your machine. 


1. Open your Terminal. These steps assume you are using **zsh**, the default shell for OSX.

1. Optionally configure your **zsh** experience.
   1. Either install [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) and add the [git-prompt](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/git-prompt) plugin, or install the plugin directly without oh-my-zsh as described under the [OS X Catalina](#os-x-catalina) instructions.

1. Install/Update **Xcode Command Line Tools** via `xcode-select --install`

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), a macOS package manager

1. Install [Redis](https://redis.io/) via `brew install redis`

1. Install [MySql 5.7](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/) via `brew install mysql@5.7`
   1. Set up your local MySQL server
      1. Force link 5.7 version via `brew link mysql@5.7 --force`
      2. Start mysql with `brew services start mysql@5.7`, which uses [Homebrew services](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-services) to manage things for you.
      3. Confirm that MySQL has started by running `brew services`. The status should show "started". If the status shows "stopped", you may need to initialize mysql first.
          1. `brew services stop mysql@5.7`
          2. `mysqld --initialize-insecure` (this will leave the root password blank, which is required)
          3. `brew services start mysql@5.7`
          4. Confirm MySQL has started by running `brew services` again.

1. Install the **Java 8 JSK**
   1. `brew install --cask adoptopenjdk/openjdk/adoptopenjdk8`
   2. Or by installing [sdkman](https://sdkman.io/) and installing a suitable JDK. Similar to **rbenv** and **nvm**, **sdkman** allows you to switch between versions of Java.
      1. Different versions will be available depending on your system architecture, use `sdk list java` to identify a Java 8 JDK available for ARM architecture.
      2. `sdk install java <version identifier>` to install a version
      3. `sdk default java <installed version>` to ensure it is the default for future shells.

1. Install and configure **rbenv**
    1. Install: `brew install rbenv`
    2. Run `echo 'eval "$(rbenv init - zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc` to configure ZSH to use **rbenv**. See https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#basic-git-checkout for instructions on configuring bash and other shells.
    3. Reload your .zshrc to load **rbenv**: `source ~/.zshrc`

1. Install **Ruby**
    1. For non-M1 systems (including M1 systems using Rosetta), running `rbenv install` from the project root directory should be sufficient.
    2. For Apple Silicon, special configuration is required to set *libffi* options correctly. The following is a single line to execute.

      ```sh
      optflags="-Wno-error=implicit-function-declaration" LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/libffi/lib" CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/libffi/include" PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/libffi/lib/pkgconfig" rbenv install
      ```

1. *(Optional)* Install **pdftk**, which is not available as a standard Homebrew formula. Skipping this will cause some PDF related tests to fail. See <https://leancrew.com/all-this/2017/01/pdftk/> and <https://github.com/turforlag/homebrew-cervezas/pull/1> for more information about pdftk on macOS.

    ```sh
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zph/homebrew-cervezas/master/pdftk.rb
    brew install ./pdftk.rb
    rm ./pdftk.rb
    ```

1. Install an assortment of additional packages via `brew install enscript gs imagemagick ruby-build coreutils sqlite parallel tidy-html5`

1. Install [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and install Node
    1. Install NVM via `brew install nvm`

    2. Running `nvm install` or `nvm use` within the project directory will install and use the version specified in [.nvmrc](.nvmrc)

    3. Running `nvm alias default $(cat ./.nvmrc)` will set your default node version for future shells.

1. Install **yarn** via `npm install -g yarn@1.22.19`

1. Install **OpenSSL**
    1. Run `brew install openssl`
    2. Following the instructions in the output, run a form of `export LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/`

1. Install [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), needed for some local app tests.

1. Return to the [Overview](#overview) to continue installation and clone the code-dot-org repo. Note that there are additional steps for Apple Silicon (M1) / Intel Mac when it comes to `bundle install` and `bundle exec rake ...` commands, which are noted in their respective steps.

### Ubuntu 18.04
[Ubuntu 18.04 iso download][ubuntu-iso-url]

Note: Virtual Machine Users should check the [Alternative note](#alternative-use-an-ubuntu-vm) below before starting

1. `sudo apt-get update`
1. `sudo apt-get install -y git mysql-server mysql-client libmysqlclient-dev libxslt1-dev libssl-dev zlib1g-dev imagemagick libmagickcore-dev libmagickwand-dev openjdk-11-jre-headless libcairo2-dev libjpeg8-dev libpango1.0-dev libgif-dev curl pdftk enscript libsqlite3-dev build-essential redis-server rbenv chromium-browser parallel`
    * **Hit enter and select default options for any configuration popups, leaving mysql passwords blank**

    * Troubleshoot: `E: Package 'pdftk' has no installation candidate`. If you run into this error, remove `pdftk` from the previous command and run it again. Then try installing `pdftk` another way:
        * Ubuntu 18.04: `sudo snap install pdftk`. 
        * If you can't get `pdftk` installed, it is ok to skip installing this package, and keep in mind that the `PDFMergerTest` test may fail when you try to run the pegasus tests locally.
   
1. *(If working from an EC2 instance)* `sudo apt-get install -y libreadline-dev libffi-dev`
1. configure your system so that `~/.bashrc` (or another startup file of your choice) will be run whenever you open a shell
    1. if you are using bash and setting up a new linux system, you may need to modify `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.profile` (your login shell configuration file) as per [this explanation](https://joshstaiger.org/archives/2005/07/bash_profile_vs.html), which recommends adding these lines:

        ```
        if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
          source ~/.bashrc
        fi     
        ```
1. Install Node and Nodejs
    1. Install the latest version of [Node Version Manager (nvm)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
    1. `nvm install v18.16.0 && nvm alias default 18.16.0` Install nodejs v18.16.0
    1. `node --version` Double check the version of node you are using. If it is wrong, then try restarting your terminal.
1. Ensure rbenv and ruby-build are properly installed
    1. run `rbenv init` and follow the instructions.
    1. Install [ruby-build as a rbenv plugin](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build#readme)
        1. `mkdir -p "$(rbenv root)"/plugins`
        1. `git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git "$(rbenv root)"/plugins/ruby-build`
    1. Use the rbenv-doctor from the [`rbenv` installation instructions](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#basic-github-checkout) to verify rbenv is set up correctly:
        1. `curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/main/bin/rbenv-doctor | bash`
    1. If there are any errors (they appear red), follow the [`rbenv` installation instructions] (https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#basic-github-checkout) to properly configure `rbenv`, following steps for **Ubuntu Desktop** so that config changes go into `.bashrc`.
    1. **Note:** Ubuntu 22.04 ships with versions of `libssl` and `openssl` that are incompatible with `ruby-build`; see https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build/discussions/1940 for context
        1. As a result, attempts to run `rbenv install` will fail. To resolve, compile a valid version of `openssl` locally and direct `rbenv` to configure ruby to use it as described here: https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build/discussions/1940#discussioncomment-2663209
1. Install Ruby with rbenv
    1. Execute `rbenv install --skip-existing` from the root directory
    1. If your PATH is missing `~/.rbenv/shims`, the next two commands might not work. Edit your .bashrc to include the following line:
       `export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:~/.rbenv/shims:$PATH"`, then run `source .bashrc` for the change to take effect (as seen in [this github issue](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv/issues/877)).
    1. `rbenv rehash`
1. Install yarn
    1. `npm install -g yarn@1.22.5`.
    1. `yarn --version` Double check the version of yarn is correct.
1. Make it so that you can run apps tests locally
    1. Add the following to `~/.bashrc` or your desired shell configuration file:
        1. `export CHROME_BIN=$(which chromium-browser)`
1. Finally, configure your mysql to allow for a proper installation. You may run into errors if you did not leave mysql passwords blank
    1. `echo "ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY '';" | sudo mysql`
1. **IMPORTANT:** Read the following notes, then go back up to the [overview](#overview) and run the commands there.
    1. If, for any reason, you are forced to interrupt the `bundle exec rake install` command before it completes,
       cd into dashboard and run `bundle exec rake db:drop` before trying `bundle exec rake install` again
    1. `bundle exec rake install` must always be called from the local project's root directory, or it won't work.
    1. Finally, don't worry if your versions don't match the versions in the overview if you're following this method; the installation should still work properly regardless

### Windows

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) allows you to run a GNU/Linux environment directly on Windows without the overhead of a virtual machine. This is the easiest way to get Ruby and other prerequisites running on Windows.

It is worthwhile to make sure that you are using WSL 2. Attempting to use WSL 1 in the past resulted in errors with mysql and pdftk installation. In order to use WSL 2, you must be running Windows 10, updated to version 2004, Build 19041 or higher. If your Windows update service doesn't give you the update automatically, you can download it [from the Windows download page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10).

1. Enable WSL ([unabridged WSL instructions here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)). You should run Powershell as Administrator for the following commands:
    1. `dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart`
    1. `dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart`
    1. Restart your machine. WSL 2 will be the default if your Windows version is sufficiently updated.
    1. `wsl --set-default-version 2`
        1. You may need to [update the WSL 2 Linux kernel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-kernel)
1. [Install Ubuntu 20.04](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NBLGGH4MSV6) (Windows Store link)
    * If you want to follow the Ubuntu setup exactly, Ubuntu 18.04 is available from the [Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual).
1. Make sure virtualization is turned on your BIOS settings.
1. From the command line, run `wsl`, or from the Start menu, find and launch 'Ubuntu'. When this runs for the first time, WSL will complete installation in the resulting terminal window.
1. Make it so that you can run apps tests locally. You have two options here:
    1. If you have Google Chrome installed on Windows, add the following to `~/.bashrc` or your desired shell configuration file to make it accessible from WSL:
        1. `export CHROME_BIN='/mnt/c/Program Files (x86)/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe'`
    1. Alternatively, ensure chromium-browser or alternatively google-chrome is installed in WSL
        1. Try running `chromium-browser`. If this does not work with the error message `Command '/usr/bin/chromium-browser' requires the chromium snap to be installed.`, you can instead install google chrome by running the following:
            1. `wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb`
            1. `sudo apt install ./google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb`
1. Followed by the [Ubuntu instructions](#ubuntu-1804) to install required tools on the Ubuntu instance, _with the following observations_:
    * If google-chrome was installed in the last step, update CHROME_BIN variable to point to google chrome (in step 9), `export CHROME_BIN=$(which google-chrome)`
    * Before updating the root password to empty in SQL (step 10), restart MySQL using `sudo /etc/init.d/mysql restart`
1. Followed by the [overview instructions](#overview), _with the following observations_:
    * Before running `bundle exec rake install`, restart the mysql service: `sudo service mysql start`

### Alternative: Use an Ubuntu VM

* Option A: Use [VMWare Player](https://my.vmware.com/en/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_workstation_player/12_0) or [Virtual Box](http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.1.24/VirtualBox-5.1.24-117012-Win.exe) and an [Ubuntu 18.04 iso image][ubuntu-iso-url]
  1. Maximum Disk Size should be set to at least 35.0 GB (the default is 20 GB and it is too small)
  2. Memory Settings for the VM should be 8 GB or higher (Right click the machine -> Settings -> "Memory for this virtual machine"  )
* Option B: Use vagrant ([install](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/)):
  1. First clone the code.org git repo to get the provided Vagrantfile (you will be able to skip step 1 of the common setup instructions): `git clone https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org.git`
  1. `cd code-dot-org`
  1. `vagrant up`
  1. `vagrant ssh`
  1. Goto step 2 of the common setup instructions
* Option C: Use an Amazon EC2 instance:
  1. Request AWS access from [accounts@code.org](mailto:accounts@code.org) if you haven't already done so.
  1. From the [EC2 Homepage](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2), click on "Launch Instance" and follow the wizard:
     * **Step 1: Choose AMI**: Select Ubuntu Server 18.04
     * **Step 2: Choose instance type**: Choose at least 16 GiB memory (e.g. `t2.xlarge`)
     * **Step 3: Configure Instance**: 
       * Set IAM Role to `DeveloperEC2`
       * Set VPC to `vpc-a48462c3`
     * **Step 4: Storage**: Increase storage to 100GiB
  1. Launch the instance. When asked for a key pair, you can create a new key pair (be sure to download and save the .pem file) or use an existing key pair that you have the .pem file for.
  1. Connect to the instance by selecting the instance in the AWS EC2 dashboard and clicking "Connect". Follow the provided instructions in order to connect via ssh or PuTTY. Upon completing this step, you should be able to connect to your instance via a command like `ssh -i <keyname>.pem <public-dns-name>`.
  1. Optionally, update your ssh config so that you can connect using a shorter command:
     * move your private key to `~/.ssh/<keyname>.pem`
     * add the following lines to ~/.ssh/config:     
       ```
       Host yourname-ec2
         Hostname <public-dns-name>
         User ubuntu
         PreferredAuthentications publickey
         IdentityFile ~/.ssh/<keyname>.pem
       ```
     * run `ssh yourname-ec2` to connect to your instance
  1. Go back up to the [overview](#overview) and run the commands there.
  1. Once you have successfully completed `bundle exec rake build`, you can connect to it as follows:
     * run `ssh -L 3000:127.0.0.1:3000 yourname-ec2` and then `~/code-dot-org/bin/dashboard-server` on your local machine. This sets up SSH port forwarding from your local machine to your ec2 dev instance for as long as your ssh connection is open.
     * navigate to http://localhost-studio.code.org:3000/ on your local machine

## Piskel
### Local Development Between code-dot-org and forked piskel repo
If you want the Code.org repo to point to the local version of the Piskel you are working on, your apps package must be linked to a local development copy of the Piskel repository with a complete dev build. 

**[You can also find the steps below in apps/Gruntfile.js of the code-dot-org repo](https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org/blob/staging/apps/Gruntfile.js)**

#### The Steps:
1. `git clone https://github.com/code-dot-org/piskel.git <new-directory>`
2. `cd <new-directory>`
3. `npm install && grunt build-dev`
4. `npm link`
5. `cd <code-dot-org apps directory>`
6. `npm link @code-dot-org/piskel`
7. rerun `yarn start` in the `<code-dot-org apps directory>`

#### Note: Using `grunt serve --force`
- If you try grunt serve and it is aborted due to warnings do `grunt serve --force`

## Enabling JavaScript builds
**Note:** the installation process now enables this by default, which is recommended. You can manually edit these values later if you want to disable local JS builds.

If you want to make JavaScript changes and have them take effect locally, you'll want to enable local builds of the JavaScript packages. You'll need to do this once:

1. Edit locals.yml and enable the following options:

   ```
   # code-dot-org/locals.yml

   # These enable the local apps build
   build_apps: true
   use_my_apps: true
   ```

1. Run `bundle exec rake package` for the changes to take effect.

This configures dashboard to rebuild apps whenever you run `bundle exec rake build` and to use the version that you built yourself.  See the documentation in that directory for faster ways to build and iterate.

## Enabling internationalization(i18n) / translations
If you want to enable the ability to switch Code.org to display different languages:
1. Edit `locals.yml` and enable the following options:
   ```
   # code-dot-org/locals.yml
   load_locales: true
   ```
## Editor configuration

We enforce linting rules for all our code, and we recommend you set up your editor to integrate with that linting.

### Javascript

We use [eslint](https://eslint.org/) to lint our Javascript; see [the official integrations guide](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations) for instructions for your editor of choice.

Our lint configuration uses formatting rules provided by [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). You can configure your editor to auto-format your code to meet our requirements, in addition to the error highlighting provided by eslint. See [the official integrations guide](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html) for instructions for your editor of choice.

### Ruby

### Bundle Install Tips

#### Apple Silicon (M1) or Intel Mac bundle install steps

On Apple Silicon/Intel Mac, additional steps are required to get `bundle install` to work.

Simply run (if you're having issues only with part of gems in the command - you can run it with just needed gems)
```
bundle update libv8 mini_racer
```
To fix issues in one line. It will update the Gemfile.lock file for you in the same way as described below.

OR

In Gemfile.lock, replace the two occurrences of libv8 (8.4.255.0) with libv8-node (15.14.0.0).
Also update mini_racer to 0.4.0 (from 0.3.1):

```
libv8-node (15.14.0.0)
...
mini_racer (0.4.0)
  libv8-node (~> 15.14.0.0)
```

Then run the following commands to successfully complete a bundle install:

```sh
gem install bundler -v 2.3.22
rbenv rehash
export LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl/lib/
bundle install
```

After `bundle install` completes successfully, before attempting the `bundle exec rake ...` commands, execute the following command to avoid errors with **ffi**

```sh
bundle update ffi
```


### ImageMagick with Pango

**Note:** Most developers won't need to peronsonalize certificates locally, but some will.  Here are notes on getting this working on macOS.

Certificates have been greatly improved with the ability to apply text in many languages.  

This is done by using “pango”.  It seems on Linux machines, ImageMagick already contains Pango, but on macOS it doesn’t... at least as installed using brew.

So we need to install a version of ImageMagick that includes Pango.  There are tons of threads online where people can’t get it to work.

The good news is that we figured out a solution.

First modify the ImageMagick formula in brew, using

```sh
brew edit imagemagick
```

Note that one developer found they needed to `brew edit imagemagick@6`.)

Change `--without-pango` to `--with-pango`.  However, that’s not enough.  Add

```text
depends_on "pango"
```

near the similar entries.  This is the step that we couldn’t find online anywhere.

Then

```sh
brew uninstall imagemagick
```

(Note that one developer found they needed to  and `brew uninstall imagemagick@6`.)
Then

```sh
brew install imagemagick@6 --build-from-source
```

Then, because it’s `@6`, we need to

```sh
brew link imagemagick@6 --force
```

to make it generally accessible from both the command line and from rmagick.
(We still use `imagemagick@6` because we need magicwand, whatever that is.)
Now, we have Pango in our ImageMagick, which we can test with

```sh
convert pango:"test text" test.png
```

Finally, it’s likely that we now have a slightly different version of ImageMagick.
We need rmagick to rediscover that with

```sh
bundle remove rmagick
bundle add rmagick
```

Restart `dashboard-server` and if all went well, we see text rendering on customized certificates again.

#### libv8

If you run into an error with libv8 while running bundle install

- Uninstall libv8: `gem uninstall libv8`
- Make sure the gem no longer exists with: `gem list libv8`
- Install the current version used in code.org repo: `gem install libv8 -v CURRENT_CODEORG_VERSION -- --with-system-v8` (you can find what to fill in for CURRENT_CODEORG_VERSION as the current version of libv8 in the [Gemfile.lock](./Gemfile.lock)).

#### mysql2

If you run into an issue about mysql2 while running `bundle install` and the error output includes "ld: library not found for -lssl" try :

- `brew install openssl`
- `export LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/`

(Steps from [this github issue](https://github.com/brianmario/mysql2/issues/795#issuecomment-439579677))

If you run into an error like "Don't know how to set rpath on your system, if MySQL libraries are not in path mysql2 may not load" during `bundle install` and are running on a Mac with M1, try :

- `gem install mysql2 -v '0.5.2' -- --with-opt-dir=$(brew --prefix openssl) --with-ldflags=-L/opt/homebrew/Cellar/zstd/1.5.0/lib`

#### therubyracer

If you run into an issue about therubyracer while running `bundle install` try :

- `gem uninstall libv8`
- `gem install therubyracer -v CURRENT_CODEORG_VERSION` (you can find  what to fill in for CURRENT_CODEORG_VERSION as the current version of the therubyracer in the [Gemfile.lock](./Gemfile.lock)).
- `gem install libv8 -v CURRENT_CODEORG_VERSION -- --with-system-v8` (You can find what to fill in for CURRENT_CODEORG_VERSION as the current version of libv8 in the [Gemfile.lock](./Gemfile.lock)).

(Steps from [this stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19577759/installing-libv8-gem-on-os-x-10-9))

#### bundler gem

If you run into the error message `can't find gem bundler (>= 0.a) with executable bundler (Gem::GemNotFoundException)` while running `bundle install` try (as seen in this [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47026174/find-spec-for-exe-cant-find-gem-bundler-0-a-gemgemnotfoundexception)):

- `gem install bundler -v BUNDLED_WITH_VERSION`, where the version is the `BUNDLED WITH` version in [Gemfile.lock](./Gemfile.lock)).
- `bundle install`

#### thin

If you run into error messages about `implicit declaration of function thin_xxx` when trying to compile the native extensions for thin:

- `gem install thin -v THIN_VERSION -- --with-cflags="-Wno-error=implicit-function-declaration"` where THIN_VERSION is the current version of thin in [Gemfile.lock](./Gemfile.lock)).

(More info [here](https://github.com/macournoyer/thin/pull/364))

#### mimemagic

If you run into an error message about `Could not find MIME type database in the following locations...` while installing the `mimemagic` gem, try:

- `brew install shared-mime-info`

(More info on mimemagic dependencies [here](https://github.com/mimemagicrb/mimemagic#dependencies), including help for OSes that don't support Homebrew.)

#### eventmachine

If bundle install fails with an error referencing `eventmachine`, try

- `gem install eventmachine -v ‘[VERSION]’ -- --with-openssl-dir=$(brew --prefix libressl)`

Where [VERSION] is the current version of eventmachine in Gemfile.lock. For example:

- `gem install eventmachine -v ‘1.2.7’ -- --with-openssl-dir=$(brew --prefix libressl)`

#### Xcode Set Up

OS X: when running `bundle install`, you may need to also run `xcode-select --install`. See [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/39730475/3991031). If this doesn't work, step 9 in the overview will not run correctly. In that case run the following command in the Terminal (found from
  <https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/issues/569>): `sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`

### Recommended hardware

While it's possible to run the server locally without these, we've found the following hardware specifications to be best for fast development.

- Memory: minimum of 8GB RAM for `dashboard-server` and `yarn`
- Storage: The repository takes up 20GB
