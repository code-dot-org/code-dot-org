entirely.  
This guide will help you get started quickly and ensure a smooth contribution process. To get full picture of
the project, please refer to the [README.md](./README.md) file.

## 🛣️ Contribution Roadmap

Here’s a quick guide to the contribution process:

1. **(The most important step!) Create a thread** in `#ask-design-system` Slack channel about your change.
   If you don't have access to our slack, feel free to reach out through github issues, pull requests or any other
   means of communication.

   - **Get approval** from the design team.
   - For technical details, ask `@code-dot-org/component-library-engineering-reviewers`.

2. **Create a separate PR** with `@code-dot-org/component-library` code changes.

   - Make sure the PR follows the [Best Practices](./README.md/#best-practices).
   - Include test cases and Storybook updates where applicable.

3. **Get it approved** by the design team and by `@code-dot-org/component-library-engineering-reviewers`, the
   code owners of this package (see [.github/CODEOWNERS](../../../.github/CODEOWNERS)).

4. **Merge the PR** once approved.

## 🧑‍💻 How to Add a New Component

1. **Create a new component** in `src/<name>/`.
2. Follow the component structure (see any component for example, for best result - see at least couple components)
   and [Best Practices](./README.md/#best-practices).
3. Add a Storybook story at `src/<name>/stories/<Name>.story.tsx`.
4. Write unit tests in `src/<name>/__tests__/` using Vitest + RTL + @testing-library/user-event.
5. Ensure accessibility using `axe` and screen readers. (see [README Accessibility Section](./README.md#-accessibility))
6. Submit a PR following the [Contribution Roadmap](#-contribution-roadmap).

## 🚦 Component Statuses & Production Checklist

To give a better understanding of components state/status and which one can and can not be used we've introduced
a complete `production-ready checklist` and different `statuses` that's applicable to every new and
existing Design System component.

### Production-ready Checklist:

- Implementation of component approved by design team;
- Covered with Storybook stories and documentation;
- Has tests: test every prop, every state and every interaction that's js related
- Passes accessibility checks (see [README Accessibility Section](./README.md#-accessibility)).;

### Possible component Statuses:

- `WIP` - Work in progress, not ready for usage in production;
- `Ready for dev` - Component is ready for development, has most of the functionality implemented but might not yet
  pass all production ready checklist criteria or might have some visual changes;
- `Stable` - Component is ready for production, passes all production ready checklist criteria;
- `DEPRECATED` - Component is deprecated and should not be introduced in new pages but may be maintained in existing
  codebases for backward compatibility;

To keep track of those two metrics simply go to component and check the top of its `JSDoc comment`
or open `Storybook's docs tab`.

Here's an example/template for better understanding:

````jsx
/**
 * ### Production-ready Checklist:
 * * (✔) implementation of component approved by design team;
 * * (✔) has storybook, covered with stories and documentation;
 * * (✘) has tests: test every prop, every state and every interaction that's js related;
 * * (?) passes accessibility checks;
 *
 * ###  Status: ```Ready for dev```
 * Design System: Some Component.
 * Some description goes here...
 */
const SomeComponent = props => {
  // ...
};
````

This information should always be on the top of the component's documentation. Once component status is set
to `Stable` or `DEPRECATED` you can remove ` * ### Production-ready Checklist`. Example:

````jsx
/**
 * ###  Status: ```Stable```
 * Design System: Some Component.
 * Some description goes here...
 */
const SomeComponent = props => {
  // ...
};
````

## 🎯 Coding Standards

- Use **TypeScript** for type safety.
- Follow the [Best Practices](./README.md#best-practices) section in the README.
- Use **semantic colors** from `@code-dot-org/component-library-styles/colors.css` where possible.
- Ensure components are tested using Vitest + RTL + @testing-library/user-event.
- Follow the [Styling Guidelines](./README.md#styling) to avoid CSS specificity issues.

## 🧪 How to Test Your Component

1. **Unit Tests** — Write tests using Vitest + RTL + @testing-library/user-event.
2. **Storybook Tests** — Ensure Storybook displays the component correctly.
3. **Accessibility Tests** — Run Axe tests and verify with a screen reader. (see [README Accessibility Section](./README.md#-accessibility))
4. **Visual Regression Tests** — Ensure the component appears correctly in all supported themes.

➡️ See the full [Testing Guide](./README.md#testing) in the README.

## 🔀 Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the Conventional Commits format for all commit messages to ensure a consistent and readable git history.

```bash
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

### ✅ Types:

| Type       | Description                                            |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `feat`     | A new feature                                          |
| `fix`      | A bug fix                                              |
| `docs`     | Documentation updates                                  |
| `refactor` | Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature  |
| `test`     | Adding missing tests or updating existing tests        |
| `chore`    | Maintenance tasks (build process, tools, dependencies) |
| `perf`     | Performance improvements                               |

### ✅ Examples:

```bash
feat(button): add new colors option support

fix(accordion): correct styling for RTL support

docs(typography): update documentation for heading elements
```

### ✅ Best Practices:

- Use present tense singular form (“add” not “added”, not “adds”).
- Keep the description concise and specific.

## 📚 Need Help?

If you need help at any point, reach out to:

- `#ask-design-system` Slack channel
- `@code-dot-org/component-library-engineering-reviewers` for technical implementation questions

## 💡 Tips for a Smooth PR Review

✅ Keep the PR focused on **one feature or fix**.  
✅ Add **clear, descriptive commit messages**.  
✅ Add screenshots or recordings to demonstrate UI changes.  
✅ Use `Draft PR` if the feature is still a work in progress.

✅ Keep PRs under 500 lines where possible (large PRs are harder to review — if necessary,
break them into smaller PRs). Of course, if it’s a PR adding a completely new component or major feature,
larger PRs are acceptable.

## ✅ How to Get Your PR Approved Faster

- If there’s no response after **24 hours**, politely ping the reviewer in Slack.
- If you receive feedback, **respond within 24 hours** to keep the momentum going.
- Make sure all **CI tests** are passing before requesting a review.
