  # A comma without surrounding double-quotes isn't necessarily bad, since it

  #   friendly name, phd <email@code.org>

  # Though in such a case, it should really be provided like this:
  #   "friendly name, phd" <email@code.org>
  #
  # But we are alerting just in case a sender has attempted to provide multiple
  # email addresses like this:
  #   friendly name <email@code.org>, second person <email2@code.org>
  #
  # Because we deprecated support for this pattern, believing that we've never
  # actually used it.

  # The regular expression itself matches commas unless they are surrounded
  # by a pair of double-quotes, and is adapted from
  # https://stackoverflow.com/a/18893443.

  # the string.
  # This means that the friendly name can contain additional < or > characters
  # without them being confused with the < > wrapping the email address at the end.
  #
  # Or just treat the entire string as an email address.
