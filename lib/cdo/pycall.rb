  # Python initializes its site-packages directory using site.py:
  # https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Lib/site.py
  # Which looks for pyenv.cfg relative to sys.executable, and uses that to properly
  # initialize the site-packages directory. Because pycall.rb uses libpython,
  # sys.executable is set to the ruby interpreter, and site.py doesn't properly
  # add site-packages for our venv to the sys.path. So, we do it manually:
  pyimport 'site'
  site.addsitedir(site_packages_path)

  # Now unset PYTHON & PYTHONHOME so we don't mess up python3-using apps
  # launched from our Ruby processes (like the aws cli)
  # see: https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org/pull/60048#issuecomment-2267510208
  pyimport 'sys' # ensure libpython is already loaded before unsetting env vars
  ENV.delete('PYTHONHOME')
  ENV.delete('PYTHON')
