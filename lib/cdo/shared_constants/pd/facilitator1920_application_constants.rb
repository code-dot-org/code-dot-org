        these teachers in your workshops?'

        be challenging to help all teachers believe every student can learn computer science. What are two strategies
        you would use to support teachers who are doubtful that this material is accessible to all of their students?'

        discussion and from your perspective, the participants seem engaged. During the next break, you mention
        to your co-facilitator that you think things are going well, but she seems concerned and says that she

        agenda for the day, decide which portions you’ll each lead, and discuss any questions or concerns
        you each have regarding the material. Your co-facilitator declines to meet and instead sends you an

        voices do not align with the philosophy of the curriculum or the Professional Learning Program. What
        strategies would you implement to balance and redirect the conversation so more voices could be heard?
