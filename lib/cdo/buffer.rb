  # Abstract class to handle asynchronous-buffering and periodic-flushing using a thread pool.
  # This class is content-agnostic, buffering objects in memory through #buffer(object).
  # Subclasses implement #flush(objects), which will be called periodically as the buffer is flushed in batches.
  #
  # Because objects are stored in memory, the buffer can synchronously flush when the Ruby process exits.
