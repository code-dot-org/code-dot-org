# A script to update the Gatekeeper settings from a yaml file.  The
# structure of the yaml file is as follows
#
# <feature name>:
# # Comment describing what the rule intends
# - rule:
#    where: (optional)
#      user_id: 2
#      script_id: 2
#    value: <boolean>
#
# So for example if I wanted to turn the "milestone" feature
# off for all scripts except for script_id 38 I would do the following
#
# milestone:
#   Turn off for all users
#   - rule:
#     value: false
#   Turn on for script 38
#   - rule:
#     where:
#       script_id: 38
#     value: true
