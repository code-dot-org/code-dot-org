     * Previously, they had been manually styling each screenshot with a
     * border. To replicate this functionality, we say that every image which
     * is an "only child" (ie, every image that's in a cell all by itself)
     * should have a border. If at some point in the future this ends up
     * styling images we _don't_ want to be styled, we could find a more
     * precise way to implement this.
