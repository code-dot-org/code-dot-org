       * slides, where in each row there's a cell with a screenshot of the slide
       * and a cell with the description.
       *
       * Previously, they had been manually styling each screenshot with a
       * border. To replicate this functionality, we say that every image which
       * is an "only child" (ie, every image that's in a cell all by itself)
       * should have a border. If at some point in the future this ends up
       * styling images we _don't_ want to be styled, we could find a more
       * precise way to implement this.
