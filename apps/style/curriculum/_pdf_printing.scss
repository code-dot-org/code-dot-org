   * Bootstrap Fixes
   *

   * extensively. Unfortunately, that means we ourselves have to use !important
   * in order to make adjustments to them. Hacks beget hacks.
   *
   * If we could eventally get rid of Bootstrap - or at least get rid of its
   * print styles - we could remove these. Until then, we are forced to violate
   * CSS best practice by using !important.
