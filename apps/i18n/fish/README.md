fish stores translations for the external repository 
[ml-activities](https://github.com/code-dot-org/ml-activities).

`en_us.json` is empty because the authority for the English content lives in the external repository. 
This file should continue to be empty. The non-English JSON files contain content because we gather 
translations and then pass them to the external repo code.
