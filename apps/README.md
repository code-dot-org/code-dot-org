# Blockly 20 Hour Curriculum

Blockly is a web-based, graphical programming editor. Users can drag blocks together to build an application. No typing required. Credit goes to these awesome [developers](https://code.google.com/p/blockly/wiki/Credits#Engineers)
and a small army of [translators](https://code.google.com/p/blockly/wiki/Credits#Translators).

This repository contains the source code for the apps [Blockly](https://code.google.com/p/blockly/) based 20 hour curriculum and Hour of Code. Information about Blockly can be found in the [wiki](https://code.google.com/p/blockly/w/list).

## Quick Start

### Installing Blockly

```
cd apps

# Machine setup (OSX with Homebrew)
brew install node
npm install -g grunt-cli

# Perform first full build
npm install
MOOC_DEV=1 grunt build
```

### Seeing your development version of Blockly in Dashboard

1. To make your changes show up in dashboard, run the following after the first time you build blockly: [has this been replaced with locals.yml?]
  ```
  cd ../dashboard
  bundle exec rake 'blockly:dev[../apps]'
  cd ../apps
  ```

1. If you find your changes are not showing up within dashboard, you may have accidentally reverted your symlink to point to the pre-built version of blockly (e.g. when switching branches or stashing changes). To check your symlink, run:
```
> ls -l dashboard/public/blockly
```
and look for something like:
```
lrwxr-xr-x  1 laurel  501  12 Apr 27 13:00 dashboard/public/blockly -> apps/build/package
```
If the symlink is in place, then when you run later builds of blockly, your results should show up in Dashboard.

### Building during development

#### Full build

To run a full build (minus localization):

```
MOOC_DEV=1 grunt build
```

* `MOOC_DEV=1` builds a 'debug' version with more readable javascript
* `grunt rebuild` does a `clean` before a `build`

See also: [Full build with blockly-core](#full-build-with-blockly-core-changes)

#### Running with live-reload server

```
grunt dev
open http://localhost:8000
```

This will serve a few sample blockly apps at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and live-reload changes to blockly.  Caveats:
* This does not update asset files. For that, use a full `grunt build`.
* The live-reload server does not pick up changes to blockly-core.  For that, see [Full build with blockly-core](#full-build-with-blockly-core-changes).
* If you get `Error: EMFILE, too many open files` while running the live-reload server (common on OSX) try increasing the OS open file limit by running `ulimit -n 1024` (and adding it to your `.bashrc`).

##### Rebuild only a single app

To have grunt rebuild only a single app, use the MOOC_APP parameter:

```
MOOC_APP=studio grunt dev
```

##### Build a single foreign language

To have grunt build a single foreign language, use the MOOC_LOCALE parameter. This will build en_us, en_loc, and the specified locale

```
MOOC_LOCALE=ar_sa grunt build
```

#### Running tests

```
grunt build # run a non-debug build before testing
grunt test
```
* If you see an error like `ReferenceError: Blockly is not defined` or notes about missing npm packages, double check that you've run `grunt build` before `grunt test`
* Right now, the tests require a full/production build to pass.  Failures like `Cannot set property 'imageDimensions_' of undefined` in setup steps may indicate that you are testing against a debug build.
* `grunt test` will also be run via Travis CI when you create a pull request

To run an individual test, use the `--grep` option to target a file or Mocha `describe` identifier:

```
grunt mochaTest --grep myTestName # e.g., 2_11, or requiredBlockUtils
```

To debug tests using the webkit inspector, just add a `--debug` flag. This will launch a new browser window with a debugger attached.
Unfortunately, this is also before bundle.js has been loaded, making it difficult to set breakpoints. The best solutions I've found
thus far are to add debugger; statements in your code, or to have your debugger break on caught exceptions, which will generally result
it breaking in some jquery code before running tests (at which point you can go set your breakpoints).

```
grunt mochaTest --grep='testname' --debug
```

We also have the ability to run a faster subset of tests without using grep. In particular, this will run without maze and turtle level tests.
```
grunt mochaTest --fast
```

- You can add new test files as /test/*Tests.js, see `/test/feedbackTests.js` as an example of adding a mock Blockly instance


#### Full build with blockly-core changes

1. Check out [blockly-core](https://github.com/code-dot-org/blockly-core/) as a sibling directory to blockly.
1. `./build_with_core.sh debug`
  * The `debug` flag builds debug versions of both blockly-core and blockly, suitable for debugging
1. `grunt dev`

### Localization

It's especially important to test your changes with localization when modifying layouts. We support
right-to-left languages and have some special layout tweaks embedded in the CSS to support that.

Running a full localization build can take several minutes. Since localization re-builds javascript files for many languages, the default build target locales are `en_us` and `en_ploc` (pseudolocalized). To build
all available locales, specify `MOOC_LOCALIZE=1` in your environment when running a task:

```bash
MOOC_LOCALIZE=1 grunt rebuild
```

Note: Using the live-reload server with localization builds is prone to the `Error: EMFILE, too many open files` problem.  See the `ulimit` fix [under the live-reload server heading](#running-with-live-reload-server).

#### Forwarding new strings on to CrowdIn

To get new strings localized using CrowdIn, we currently run a script in a private repository. Contact a code.org engineer to trigger an update.

### Adding a new npm package

To add a new package using npm, e.g., `lodash`, run: `npm i --save-dev lodash`

- `--save-dev` adds the dependency to node's package.json, freezing the current version
- Because the build process is done in dev mode, include dependencies as devDependencies rather than production dependencies
