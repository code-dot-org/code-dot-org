This folder contains UI components that are used in multiple places
across the site.

Components in this folder do not have Design System counterparts,
but are still generic enough to be reusable. If there is a DSCO component that
can suit your needs, use it rather than a component from this directory.

We're in the process of inventorying, consolidating and deleting components,
so please be mindful of clean up opportunities when using these components.

You can find more details about modernization efforts [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yxek5dqYKLJUraB17yCdEFLlJvlOiB1zhSWZAuu3zPU/edit#heading=h.18w2m61099gz)
