This folder contains old versions of generic, reusable, customizable UI components 
that are still used on the site.

⚠️ Use the components in here with caution! 

If you are tempted to use one of these components for a new UI or if you are touching a
file that already uses a component from this folder, check if there is a comparable component that suits your needs in the componentLibrary folder. The componentLibrary folder contains the most updated versions of components consistent with the current Design System. 

Ultimately, we want to deprecate the components in this file when the Component Library is finished and the Design System components are used more widely.
