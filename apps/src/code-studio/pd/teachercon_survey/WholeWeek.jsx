              Instruction and class activities should focus on maintaining high
              standards and rigor so that students reach the highest level of
              achievement, even if some students struggle with the material.

            <p>
              Instruction and class activities should focus on ensuring that
              students with the least prior knowledge and preparation are not
              left behind, even if that means that less material can be covered.

              Computer science teachers have a responsibility to recruit a set
              of students into their classrooms that are representative of the
              school’s population in terms of diversity (gender, racial,

            <h4>Statement B</h4>
            <p>
              Computer science teachers’ responsibility is to promote their
              computer science classes broadly, to all students. The diversity
              of the class will reflect those most interested in taking a
              computer science class.
