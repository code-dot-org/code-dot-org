          <p>
            Photos from Code.org workshops are commonly posted to social media
            by other workshop attendees, by workshop facilitators, or even
            sometimes by Code.org. If you're okay with having your photo taken
            and shared in this way, please check "YES" in the box below.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you do not wish to have your photo taken, it is your
            responsibility to communicate this to your workshop facilitator in
            advance.
          </p>
          <p>

            employees the right to take photographs of me and my personal
            property during the duration of this and any future professional
            development workshops provided by Code.org, for the sole purpose of
            posting to social media and other similar digital marketing. I
            further acknowledge that participation is voluntary and that neither
            I or nor Code.org will receive financial compensation of any type
            associated with the publication of these photographs, and that
            publication of said photos confers no rights of ownership or
            royalties whatsoever. I hereby release Code.org, its contractors,
            its employees and any third parties involved in the creation or
            publication of Code.org digital marketing, from liability for any
            claims by me or any third party in connection with my participation.
