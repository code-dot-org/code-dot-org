          Code.org works closely with local Regional Partners to organize and deliver the
          Professional Learning Program. By enrolling in this workshop, you are agreeing to
          allow Code.org to share information on how you use Code.org and the Professional
          Learning resources with your Regional Partner and school district. In order to
          organize the workshops and support you, our partners need to know who is attending
          and what content is relevant for them. So, we will share your contact information,
          which courses/units you are using in your classrooms and aggregate data about your
          classes. This includes the number of students in your classes, the demographic breakdown
          of your classroom, and the name of your school and district. We will not share any
          information about individual students with our Regional Partners - all information will
          be de-identified and aggregated. Our Regional Partners are contractually obliged to treat
          this information with the same level of confidentiality as Code.org.
