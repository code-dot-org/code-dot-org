          Code.org works closely with local Regional Partners to organize and
          deliver the Professional Learning Program. By submitting this
          application, you are agreeing to allow Code.org to share information
          on how you use Code.org and the Professional Learning resources with
          your Regional Partner and school district. In order to organize the
          workshops and support you, our partners need to know who is attending
          and what content is relevant for them. So, we will share your contact
          information, which courses/units you are using in your classrooms and
          aggregate data about your classes. This includes the number of
          students in your classes, the demographic breakdown of your classroom,
          and the name of your school and district. We will not share any
          information about individual students with our Regional Partners - all
          information will be de-identified and aggregated. Our Regional
          Partners are contractually obliged to treat this information with the
          same level of confidentiality as Code.org. To see the full Code.org

          Teachers may be required to get principal approval process for your
          submission to the Professional Learning Program. As part of this
          process your principal may opt-in to let the College Board share
          de-identified and aggregated Computer Science AP scores with Code.org
          to help us improve the program and curriculum. AP test scores will not
          be shared with Regional Partners.
