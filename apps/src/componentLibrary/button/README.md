# `apps/src/componentLibrary/button`

## Consuming This Component

This package exports two styled React components: [Button](Button.tsx), [LinkButton](LinkButton.tsx).
They are identical visually, the only difference is that ```Button``` render ```<button>```, ```LinkButton``` renders ```<a>```.

You can import them like this:

```javascript
import Button from '@cdo/apps/componentLibrary/button';
import {Button, LinkButton} from '@cdo/apps/componentLibrary/button';
```

Both of [Button](Button.tsx) and [LinkButton](LinkButton.tsx) are actually aliases for [_BaseButton](./_baseButton/_BaseButton.tsx) component which handles all the logic and styles,
which is not exported from this package (since it's a private component for DesignSystem internal use only).

**(!Important) ```_BaseButton``` is a private component and should not be used directly. (!Important)**
If you need to create a new button component outside of DesignSystem scope, you should use [Button](Button.tsx) or [LinkButton](LinkButton.tsx) as a base.

For guidelines on how to use these components and the features they
offer, [visit Storybook](https://code-dot-org.github.io/dsco_)
(link to be updated once code-dot-org storybook will be public.).
Or run storybook locally and go
to [Design System / Button](http://localhost:9001/?path=/story/designsystem-button-component--default-button).
