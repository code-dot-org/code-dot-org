# AI Lessons (hackathon prototype)

A small end-to-end surface mounted at `/ai_lessons` that demonstrates
AI-authored, AI-tutored, AI-evaluated lessons running on top of the
existing Lab2 surfaces (Web Lab 2, Music Lab, and Panels) without going
through the Level / Lesson / Script ActiveRecord pipeline.

Code lives under:

- `apps/src/aiLessons/` — the React surface (this directory)
- `apps/src/sites/studio/pages/ai_lessons/` — webpack entry shims
- `dashboard/app/controllers/ai_lessons_controller.rb` — Rails controller
- `dashboard/app/views/ai_lessons/*.html.haml` — view shells + locale loader
- `dashboard/config/ai_lessons/` — repo-shipped exemplar lessons (read-only
  through the UI; edit the JSON directly)
- `dashboard/tmp/ai_lessons/` — on-disk storage (lessons, sources, images,
  progress)

The surface is wired so that none of it depends on production Level
infrastructure; it can be deleted in a single commit without leaving
schema or seed scars.

## Goals (the motivations behind the prototype)

1. **Streamline instructional content on the page.** Instead of dumping
   a list of four "Do this" bullet points and a wall of explanation onto
   the student, break the work into discrete, single-target checkpoints.
   Each checkpoint has one objective; the AI Tutor synthesises the
   instructions on the fly and the student sees one focused message at a
   time.

2. **One voice, one judge.** The AI Tutor is the only entity that talks
   to the student. It writes the per-checkpoint instructions, evaluates
   the work, and decides when to advance. There are no separate
   validation conditions, server-side validators, or unit-test-like
   completion checks. The model gets the lesson plan, the student's
   live source, and a structured success criterion; it returns
   `{message, action ∈ stay|advance|celebrate}` via a constrained
   `Output.object` schema, and the surface obeys.

3. **Eschew the existing Level/Lesson/Script models.** Lessons are
   plain JSON files on disk under `dashboard/tmp/ai_lessons/`. There is
   no DB migration, no seed file, no `Level` row, no `Lesson` row, no
   `Script` row. The trade-off is that this prototype can't be shared
   with the wider curriculum surface, but the iteration speed is much
   higher and the blast radius is zero.

4. **Explore AI-generated lesson content.** The curriculum author types
   one paragraph ("create a 5-checkpoint lesson on loops using Music
   Lab and Web Lab 2 for grade 6") and the AI fills in everything —
   title, objective, ordered checkpoints, lab type assignments,
   success criteria, panel slide captions, and panel illustrations.
   The author can edit any of it inline before saving.
