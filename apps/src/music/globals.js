// This module will hold some references to values that are currently
// stored in React state (in MusicView), so that non-React code related
// to Blockly blocks can access them.
//
// Longer term, we would like to hoist this "global" app state out of
// our React code, allowing our React code to return to being just a
// "view", and so that non-React code can also work more naturally with
// this data.
