  The 'commands' file assembles a set of calls that student code can make
  onto a single exported object.  Much of this code is reused, and gets applied
  to the exported object via helpers.

  This object does not necessarily represent an exhaustive list of commands
  available; some are provided 'natively' by the interpreter, some are loaded
  as part of a standard config (see dropletUtils.js) and, in Gamelab's case,
  some are dynamically grabbed from the p5/p5.play libraries.
