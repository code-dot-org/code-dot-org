# Panels

This is a React client for a `panels` level using [Lab2](../lab2/).

A panels level displays a series of information panels.  In its initial implementation, each panel contains one image and one piece of text.  The location of the text can be specified.

In the future, this level type could be easily expanded to support additional layouts (e.g. multiple images and/or multiple pieces of text per panel), and additional media types (e.g. short videos).
