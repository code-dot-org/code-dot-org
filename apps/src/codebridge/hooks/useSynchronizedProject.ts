/*
  CDOIDE is designed as an opaque component that receives a ProjectType, manipulates it, and then
  calls a callback with any changes to it.

  Internally, it keeps track of its own state via a `useReducer` method, and useReducer does -not-
  play as nicely with this pattern (a simple `useState` would be more user friendly in this regard, but
  also gives us fewer state management niceties. Nonetheless, this is enough of a nuisance to consider
  a future refactor to a simpler `setState` call.)

  So this hook keeps that internal and external data in sync because `useReducer` provides no direct access to the store.

  CDOIDE itself calls it with the externalProject that was handed in. Further comments are inline below.

  // is called. That means that our project changed externally and we were given new data. In that case, we
