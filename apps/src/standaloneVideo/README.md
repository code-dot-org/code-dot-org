# Standalone Video

This is a React client for a `standalone_video` level using [Lab2](../lab2/)..

It doesn't yet support all client-side features of a legacy `standalone_video` level, such as the fallback video player and non-video slides.

Note that this is only
used for levels that use Lab2.  For levels that don't use Lab2, they will get
an older-style level implemented with [a HAML page](https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org/blob/539f9418346547f9633d761dc99e854e665a8121/dashboard/app/views/levels/_standalone_video.html.haml) and [some non-React JS code](https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org/blob/539f9418346547f9633d761dc99e854e665a8121/apps/src/sites/studio/pages/levels/_standalone_video.js).
