/**
 * Compares two images using a visual diff function provided by the
 * mapbox/pixelmatch library, which can account for anti-aliasing and
 * has a configurable error threshold.
 *
 * This assertion accepts images in a variety of formats, doing conversions
 * as needed to make test cases more readable.  For example, you could
 * give the URL of a fixture image and a canvas you've been drawing on,
 * and this method will compare them like you'd expect it to.
 *
 * @param {string|HTMLImageElement|HTMLCanvasElement|ImageData} expected
 * @param {string|HTMLImageElement|HTMLCanvasElement|ImageData} actual
 * @param {number} [threshold]
 *   How precise the comparison should be, given in the range [0..1]
 *   where lower is more precise.  Zero checks that the binary image data
 *   is an exact match, which tends to be too brittle for our purposes
 *   because there are subtle differences in how browsers encode images.
 *   Even Chrome and ChromeHeadless give different results at this level
 *   of precision.
 * @returns {Promise} Resolves if the images visually match, rejects with
 *   an assertion error if they do not match.
