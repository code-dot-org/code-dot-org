# cdo-donors has a weight column whose maximum value must be 1.0 in
# order for our weighted random select to work. Even though the gsheet
# that this data is coming from has algorithms that should enforce this,
# it's gotten messed up on occasion, and that mistake has in at least
# one case made it through to production.
#
# This test is intended to catch such a glitch before it makes it to
# production.
