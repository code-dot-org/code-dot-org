<h4>Help the world learn how to code:</h4>

<h2>1) Learn yourself (or have your child learn)</h2>

<p><a href="https://code.org/learn">Learn online</a> or <a href="https://code.org/learn/local">find local schools, camps, or workshops</a> that teach coding.</p>

<h2>2) <a href="https://hourofcode.com">Host an Hour of Code</a> at work, in your community, or local school</h2>

<p>During this year's Computer Science Education Week in December, help students worldwide learn their first Hour of Code. Organize an Hour of Code event at your office, a local school, or anywhere in your community. Or <a href="https://code.org/learn">try it yourself</a>.</p>

<h2>3) Ask your local school to <a href="https://code.org/educate">teach computer science</a>
</h2>

<p>Here's a <a href="https://code.org/promote/letter">sample letter</a> to send to your school! Your local school can teach these <a href="https://studio.code.org">intro courses</a>, partner with us to bring computer science <a href="https://code.org/educate/partner">to your entire district or region</a>, and inspire students with <a href="https://code.org/educate/inspire">these videos</a>. Check <a href="https://code.org/learn/local">our map</a> to see if your school teaches computer science. If not, ask them to.</p>

<h2>4) Support our work</h2>

<p><a href="https://code.org/donate">Make a generous donation</a> or <a href="https://store.code.org">buy a t-shirt or hat</a>. We're working to give every student the opportunity to learn computer science. One child learns for every dollar you donate.</p>

<h2>5) Not in the United States? Sign up to receive updates about Code.org's International Program</h2>
