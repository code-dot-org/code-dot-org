<p>Hi Fake Name,</p>

<p>Fake Name is a teacher at Fabricated Elementary. They found you on the <a href="https://code.org/volunteer/local">volunteer site</a> and after reviewing your profile specifically requested if you could help their class. They would like it if you could:</p>

<ul>
<li> visit the classroom for technical help and inspiration


</li>
</ul>

<p>We won't release your email directly to a teacher, so they're waiting for you to write back.</p>

<p>Most schools still don’t teach computer science. Most students don’t know that it’s about solving big problems and connecting us all closer together. This is your chance to inspire at least one young person in your area. If you are available to volunteer with this teacher, <strong>please contact Fake Name directly at <a href="mailto:name.fake@fabricated.edu">name.fake@fabricated.edu</a></strong>.</p>

<p>In your email to Fake Name, please be sure to share the following information:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your name, company, and job description</li>
<li>Days and times you are available to volunteer</li>
<li>Why you chose to volunteer to inspire students</li>
<li>Ask if there is any paperwork you need to fill out before volunteering</li>
</ul>

<p>Best,
Alice Steinglass<br>
President, Code.org</p>
