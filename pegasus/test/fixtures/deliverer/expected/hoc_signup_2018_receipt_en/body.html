<h3>Thanks for signing up to host an Hour of Code!</h3>

<p>Thank you for helping make it possible for students to start learning computer science! Computer Science Education Week and the Hour of Code run from December 3-9, and we couldn't be more excited. </p>

This year, each set comes with 6 posters and 126 "I did the Hour of Code" stickers. With the discount you'll get them for less than our cost to make them. Supplies are limited, so order your posters soon. If you're not in the United States, you can <a href="https://hourofcode.com/promote/resources#posters">download and print all posters</a>.</p>
