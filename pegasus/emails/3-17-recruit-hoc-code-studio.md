**If you enjoyed the Hour of Code in December, keep going beyond one hour.**

Try our 20-hour courses that students love. They all combine self-paced, online lessons with “unplugged” classroom activities. 

Code.org's online platform [Code Studio](https://studio.code.org/) enables students to learn the basic concepts of computer science as early as kindergarten. Teachers can track student progress and access lesson plans online.
