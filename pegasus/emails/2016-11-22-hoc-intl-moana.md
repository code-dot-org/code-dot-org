<h3>Introducing "Disney: Wayfinding with Code"</h3>


Today Code.org and Disney revealed [a new Hour of Code tutorial](http://Disney.com/WayfindingWithCode) featuring characters from an upcoming Disney animated film. We are thrilled to be able to offer this activity to you as you prepare to do an Hour of Code with your classrooms between December 5-11 to celebrate Computer Science Education Week—and no experience with code is required to teach it.

We’ve partnered with Disney and Lucasfilm in the past on Hour of Code activities featuring Frozen and Star Wars™ characters—some of our most popular ever, thanks to you. We were particularly excited that both of these beloved tutorials featured strong female characters—teachers used these to provide an introduction to computer science for female students around the world. 

You’ve helped the Hour of Code reach 50 million girls, a milestone in female participation for computer science. Help us reach 50 million more with [“Disney: Wayfinding with Code”](http://Disney.com/WayfindingWithCode)!

The story of the “Disney: Wayfinding with Code” tutorial centers around two characters as they sail through unknown territory across the ocean. As students follow these travels, they learn basic coding commands that help steer the boat. Along the way, students are introduced to conditionals, sequences and loops while they master the art of navigation. When the characters are suddenly attacked by the Kakamora – coconut-clad warriors—they must use their coding skills to dodge their pirate projectiles and penetrate their defenses. 

The “Disney: Wayfinding with Code” tutorial is available in more than 180 countries and 23 languages, including Samoan Polynesian. Thank you to Disney for helping us give children all over the world the opportunity to learn the basics of coding. 


<h3>Inspire your classroom with a local volunteer</h3>

Invite a local volunteer to inspire your students by talking about the breadth of possibilities in computer science. There are thousands of volunteers around the world ready to help with your Hour of Code. [Use this map](https://code.org/volunteer/local) to find local volunteers who can visit your classroom or join a video chat with your students.

<small>Notice: Code.org hasn't vetted volunteers listed on the map and makes no assurances about them. We simply offer a matching service, and Hour of Code planners should do their own background checks in compliance with local policies.</small>

Computer Science Education Week (December 5-11, 2016) is almost here! [Sign up your Hour of Code event here](http://hourofcode.com/#join) and check out all the new activities that you can filter on our site based on grade level, experience level, subject area, and more. Find the perfect activity for your class at [https://code.org/learn](https://code.org/learn).

Have fun with your class this December, and thank you for leading this movement!
