Dear Hour of Code volunteer,

We're so excited to share that more than 5,000 of you have signed up. Today, we open our volunteer search with Hour of Code organizers who requested your help.

## Here’s what you should expect: 

1. Teachers can search for volunteers in their area to learn a little more about you, based on the information you shared. They’ll be able to find you [on this worldwide map](https://code.org/volunteer/local). 

2. If a teacher would like you to help with their Hour of Code, they will contact you through an online form. You will receive an email coming from me (Tanya at Code.org) sharing the teacher’s message and full contact information. 

3. **Please directly contact teachers if you’re able to help out. We won't release your email address to a teacher, so he or she will wait for you to write back.**

Soon, we’ll share more info to help you prepare to volunteer. In the meantime, you can review this [how-to guide](https://hourofcode.com/us/how-to/volunteers). You can also [order custom Hour of Code t-shirts](http://blog.code.org/post/132608499493/hour-of-code-shirts-and-more) for the event. Or wear the movement with a [CODE t-shirt or hat](http://store.code.org/).

Thank you for supporting this movement, 

Tanya Parker,<br />
Product Manager, Code.org


P.S. If you’re getting too many emails, you can unsubscribe from additional volunteer requests until a later time at the bottom of request emails. Or, ask a friend or coworker to join you in volunteering to reach more students in your area :)
