This is an email notifying you that <%= name_s%> has canceled their registration for your workshop on <%= workshop['dates'].map{|i| i['date_s']}.join(', ') %> at [<%= workshop['location_name_s'] %>](http://<%=CDO.canonical_hostname('code.org')%>/manage-professional-development-workshops#/<%= workshop_row[:secret] %>/view).

Their registration has been removed from your affiliate dashboard and a spot has opened up for another teacher to sign up.
