Hour of Code organizer, 

You asked for help connecting with a tech volunteer to inspire your students and introduce them to a world of possibilities that comes with learning to code. 7,000 volunteers are ready to help teachers during Dec. 7-13.

### Now is the time to invite a volunteer to your Hour of Code

The Hour of Code is just a few weeks away. Most volunteers only plan to visit one classroom. If you want help, now is the time to search our volunteer map and contact one.

### [Find volunteers here](https://code.org/volunteer/local)

### Here are some tips for finding a volunteer through our map:

- Type in your city to find all volunteers in your area. The default view shows the entire United States, but may not show every volunteer. 
- Expand your search filters by distance and number of volunteers.
- If you can’t find a volunteer in your area, search in another city for remote volunteers who can video chat with your class. 
- Contact 3x more volunteers than you need. Some might not be available at the time of your event. 

You can also prep for your Hour of Code using [this how-to guide](https://hourofcode.com/how-to), choose from [new tutorials for every age and every device](https://code.org/learn) (featuring Minecraft and Star Wars!), and challenge another teacher you know to join the worldwide Hour of Code event. 

Keep in mind: Code.org has not vetted volunteers, as explained below.
