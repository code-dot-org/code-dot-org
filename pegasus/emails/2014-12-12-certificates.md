## 70 million down, 30 million to go

When the Hour of Code launched a year ago, we had no idea how fast it would spread. To date, 70M students have tried the Hour of Code, including you. 

This week, millions of people are learning new skills that can change the rest of their lives. Take one more hour to keep learning something new, or pass it on to a friend:

Code with [Angry Birds](https://code.org/hoc) - [with Elsa](https://code.org/frozen) - [with Flappy Bird](https://code.org/flappy)

(Now our tutorials are available in more languages, [try one now](https://code.org/learn/)!)

Even a pretty special student tried it this week, to show that *anybody* can learn, the President of the United States.

**Thank you**<br />
I can’t believe our ambitious goal to reach 100M students is in reach. We’re seeing a sea-change in education and it’s thanks to the collective effort of [200 partners](https://code.org/about/partners/)... and you. Your personal stories and support have made this the best job I could ever imagine.

We’ve been deluged by requests about our hat that’s been worn by celebrities and even the president. If you [buy our t-shirts and hats](https://code.org/shop/), wear them with pride.

**P.S.**<br />
Our crowdfunding campaign has **2 days left**! We’ll use the funds to bring computer science to 25,000 new classrooms by 2016. For each dollar you give, one student will learn. [Please support our work](https://code.org/donate/).
