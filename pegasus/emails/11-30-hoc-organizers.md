subject: Your Hour of Code next week
---


#### Next week, students at 155,000 events around the world will learn their first Hour of Code, jumping into a field that can change the rest of their lives!

*Here’s what you should know to make your Hour of Code a success:*

### 1) Print certificates for your students 
You can print Hour of Code certificates in bulk at [code.org/certificates](https://code.org/certificates). Students will also see a certificate when they complete an Hour of Code tutorial, but some students won’t make it to the very end in an hour — and that’s okay.

### 2) See even more new tutorial options
There are 50 Hour of Code tutorials available for every age and every device. In case you missed it, there’s now a tablet-friendly, blocked-based version of [Star Wars: Building a Galaxy with Code](https://code.org/starwars) for younger beginners. 
<% else %>
### 2) Learn an Hour of Code in 44 languages
Hour of Code tutorials are available in 44 languages. If you want to help translate new tutorials into more languages, visit [code.org/translate](https://code.org/translate). In case you missed it, there’s now a tablet-friendly, blocked-based version of [*Star Wars*: Building a Galaxy with Code](https://code.org/starwars) for younger beginners. For schools with limited Internet access, look out for tutorials that can be done offline available later this week.

### 3) Use friendly urls
When you’re ready to start your Hour of Code, you can write an easy, “friendly url” on the board. [Each tutorial](https://code.org/learn) has a short link. Instruct students to type it into their browsers to get started.

### 4) Watch inspiring video chats – celebrate computer science all week
Throughout next week, role models who’ve made Instagram, BuzzFeed, and top-charting music hits will chat with classrooms about changing the world with code. [Tune into the live chats with students](https://hourofcode.com/prizes#video-chats), or watch the video archives. 

### 5) Find a technical volunteer to help your class
9,087 technical volunteers have signed up to help, and most of them haven’t heard from you yet. There’s still time to find a volunteer near you using our volunteer map and invite one to join your Hour of Code. [Find volunteers](https://code.org/volunteer/local).
