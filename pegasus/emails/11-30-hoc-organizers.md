Since the very beginning, probably the #1 Hour of Code request we’ve heard is a tutorial featuring “Minecraft,” a game very special to girls and boys alike. We heard you! Today, we present [Minecraft Hour of Code](https://code.org/mc), in partnership with Microsoft and Mojang AB for the Hour of Code coming in just three weeks.

The tutorial introduces learners to basic coding and guides them to mine, build, and explore in a 2-D “Minecraft” world.
