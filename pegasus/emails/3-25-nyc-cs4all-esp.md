Dear NYC educator, 

You started teaching with Code Studio in your classroom. Now, New York City public and charter elementary schools can apply for the [Computer Science for All: Elementary School Pilot](http://sepnyc.org/escsp/). The application period **opens March 28th** and **closes April 22nd**. Have your school [apply](http://sepnyc.org/application/#elementary). 

In September 2015, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced [Computer Science for All](http://nyc.gov/computerscience) (CS4All), an initiative that will provide computer science education to every public school student over the next ten years. The Department of Education’s first initiative to reach elementary students is the [Elementary School Computer Science Pilot](http://sepnyc.org/escsp/) (ESCSP), and we want your school to participate. 

### Foundational knowledge for *all* students
The goals of the program are to increase the number of elementary school students, particularly from traditionally underrepresented groups, who have had exposure to and experience with computer science, and to develop students’ computational thinking and problem solving skills in real-world contexts.

### Add computer science to your school - enrollment open now
The [ESCSP](http://sepnyc.org/escsp/) is accepting applications for the first cohort. [Apply now](http://sepnyc.org/application/#elementary). Consideration to participate in the pilot is based on: 

- Interested schools should form school teams of 3-7 teachers who must [complete an application](http://sepnyc.org/application/#elementary) prior to the deadline April 22, 2016. 
- At a minimum, a school team must consist of a lead teacher from each grade band (K-2 and 3-5) and a technology teacher where available. 
- Schools selected for the pilot will be provided extensive professional development to prepare them to offer a scope and sequence to engage all grades while giving individual schools the flexibility to focus on a K-2 and 3-5 implementation. 
- An administrator must play an active role in supporting the implementation of this pilot.

### Learn More
School staff members are invited to [webinars](http://sepnyc.org/escsp/webinars) on either April 4 or April 13. For questions, email escsp@strongschools.nyc.
