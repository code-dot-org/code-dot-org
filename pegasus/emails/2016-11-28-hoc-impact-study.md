Dear <%= user_name %>,

Are you taking part in the Hour of Code? If so, please help us to better understand if Hour of Code activities have an impact on students. Teachers tell us the activities are fun and engaging and help students feel more confident about computer science, so we’re doing a study measure it. To thank you for participating, we’ll send you a $10 Apple gift certificate. 

To gather information about this, we plan to ask students 4 quick questions before and after they engage in their Hour of Code activities. The questions are:

1. I like computer science
2. I think computer science is interesting
3. I have the ability to learn computer science
4. I am better at computer science than most kids at my school

We will also ask them about their prior computer science experience before they start. Not only will this help us understand how Hour of Code impacts them, you will also be able to view your students’ aggregated survey results, helping you to understand how they feel about computer science and their ability to to learn it.


If you are willing to take part, please go [here](https://goo.gl/forms/C1GItB6b40w2Qkp32) to answer a few quick questions about your class, and from there you will be directed to the instructions for how to access these special Hour of Code tutorials.


Thanks for helping! <br />Rachel Phillips, PhD
