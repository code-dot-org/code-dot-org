Dear Seattle-area Code Studio teacher, 

You are part of a special group of teachers who call the Seattle area home, just like Code.org. 

While 150,000 teachers worldwide have signed up on Code.org’s [Code Studio](http://studio.code.org) to bring coding into their classrooms, I want to invite you to participate in a few local opportunities coming up when the school year starts.

### We are looking to visit Code Studio classrooms for:

- Code.org Product team vists — to observe learning and get feedback to improve our courses.
- A TV news opportunity about your students learning to code (Coming up on Sept. 9!).
- Ongoing media and photo opportunities — to highlight your students’ great work.


**Please complete this form if you’re interested in participating:**

We’ll contact you if your classroom sounds like a fit. Thank you for all you do to support CS education in the Seattle area, and best of luck on a successful 2015-16 school year.

Melissa Jones<br />
Teacher Community Manager, Code.org
