3 years ago, we [launched Code.org with a video](https://youtu.be/nKIu9yen5nc), starring people like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg inspiring students to learn to code. More than 2 million of you signed our petition to give every student in every school the opportunity to learn computer science.

Since then we’ve seen [hundreds of thousands of teachers, 100 cities and districts, 18 states, and even 7 entire nations](http://code.org/about/2015) embrace computer science in grades K-12!

Today, the White House added its support to this grassroots movement, announcing a plan to help every student in America’s public schools learn computer science, especially girls and underrepresented students of color. This is a big deal. The [Computer Science for All](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/01/30/computer-science-all) initiative proposes $4 billion in funding and additional support for training teachers to bring computer science to students. Watch the president’s full remarks [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sthaV8ddJ4&feature=youtu.be). 

We couldn’t be happier about the [**bipartisan** support for computer science](https://youtu.be/W5QGo_Yb_Pc), and we want your help to show the local support for this movement:

On a personal note, it’s been amazing and humbling to start an effort like Code.org, to watch the worldwide community of teachers, parents, and students, uniting to change our education system. Today is a milestone for all of us in this community effort.

Thank you, thank you, for your support
