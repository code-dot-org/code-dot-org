### A historic crowdfunding campaign - double your impact for students

Thanks to your generous support of Code.org, 44 million students have learned their first [Hour of Code](http://hourofcode.com) to date. 1.5 million continued to learn beyond the first hour, across 40,000 classrooms. 15 states changed education policies in support. And this fall, 300 urban high school classrooms began new computer science courses reaching [13,000 students, 60% of whom are African American and Hispanic](http://codeorg.tumblr.com/post/98856300118/diversity). This wouldn’t be possible without your generous gift. 

But, there’s so much more to do. Most schools still don’t offer any computer science classes. Our kids, your kids, every kid in the country, regardless of background and race, deserve opportunity...now.

### 100 million students, and 10,000 new teachers

Today we announced an ambitious goal - we want to reach 100 million students of all ages to try one Hour of Code by Computer Science Education Week (Dec 8 – 14), worldwide this year. And over the course of the coming year we plan to train new 10,000 computer science teachers. We need $5 million to do this, and your help.
