Thank you for hosting an Hour of Code! Over 3,500 organizers participated in Latin America, introducing thousands of students to skills that can change the rest of their lives.

**Your Gift**

Of course, we promised 10 GB of Dropbox space as a thank you. **Note:** if you have redeemed a 10 GB Dropbox code in the past, you can only apply your new code to a *different* Dropbox account.

**Beyond an Hour of Code**

If you enjoyed your Hour of Code, participate in the global Hour of Code celebration taking place December 7-13th! Exciting new tutorials are coming soon.

Or, keep going with full introductory computer science courses on [Code Studio](https://studio.code.org/). 

Thank you for being part of this movement,

Hadi Partovi
