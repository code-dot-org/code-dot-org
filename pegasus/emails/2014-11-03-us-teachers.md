## New tutorials are coming soon
We can’t wait to share them. Let us know if you’ll be doing the Hour of Code, we’ll email you as soon as this year’s activities are ready to try.

## Anybody can participate. No experience needed, no computers either.

With 5 weeks to go, give your students a chance to learn foundational 21st-century skills and help the Hour of Code get to 100 million students!
