### 13,000 teachers want technical volunteers to help with their Hour of Code in December.

### Only 3,372 volunteers have signed up. Please join them.

We’ve launched a new volunteer-match program to help teachers introduce students to their first Hour of Code during December 7-13. Our schools and teachers need you to help or inspire their students as they try computer science for the first time.

#### [Please, sign up to volunteer for one hour.](https://code.org/engineer)

After you sign up, local teachers will be able to find you and ask for help (we’ll never share your contact information). You can [check out our Hour of Code tutorials](https://code.org/learn) for all ages to see what students will be learning, but keep in mind: our most exciting lessons yet are coming in a few weeks!

If you’re a software engineer, computer science student, or have a technical background, this is a unique opportunity to interact with students, share your story, and inspire young people in your area to keep learning to code. 

#### Most students don’t ever get to try computer science. We can change that.

Thank you for your support,
