### 12,376 teachers want technical volunteers to help with their Hour of Code in December.

### Only 3,245 volunteers have signed up. Please join them.

Our schools and teachers need you to help or inspire their classrooms as they try computer science for the first time. We’ve launched a new volunteer-match program to help teachers introduce students to their first Hour of Code during December 7-13. 

#### [Please, sign up to volunteer for one hour.](https://code.org/engineer)

After you sign up, local teachers will be able to find you and ask for help (we’ll never share your contact information). You can [check out our Hour of Code tutorials](https://code.org/learn) for all ages to see what students will be learning, but keep in mind: our most exciting lessons yet are coming in a few weeks!

If you’re a software engineer, computer science student, or have a technical background, this is a unique opportunity to interact with students, share your story, and inspire young people in your area to keep learning to code. 

#### Most students don’t ever get to try computer science. We can change that.

Thank you for your support,
