Today, Idaho may pass legislation that can make it a national leader in computer science education.

Idaho is considering a comprehensive policy that would establish a state computer science initiative, giving all K-12 students access foundational 21st-century skills that they need in today’s high-tech world.

**Please, add your support — [Ask your reps to support this change](http://www.congressweb.com/code/20)**

Right now there are 1,400 open computing jobs in Idaho (across all industries) and these jobs are in high demand. But most schools don’t offer computer science at all. This is a problem we can solve.

Most importantly, *every* student today should have the opportunity to learn how technology works.

**[Ask your reps to support H037](http://www.congressweb.com/code/20)**

Idaho has led the nation in computer science and trained hundreds of K-12 teachers. With your help, we have a chance to make more progress and give our students the education they deserve.
