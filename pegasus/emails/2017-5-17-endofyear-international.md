Hello teachers!

The days are longer, the sun’s brighter, and students (and teachers) can’t wait to start summer break! 

I want to share an amazing end-of-year stat about our collective movement to spread computer science in schools: 20% of all U.S. students now have accounts on Code.org, and most of them joined this past year! Beyond the U.S., 10% of all the world’s students have coded on Code.org. Thanks to passionate teachers like you, anything is possible.

I hope you can take steps to broaden participation in computer science before your summer break. Some ideas:

### Try an end of year activity or guest speaker to inspire students

Ten thousand passionate technologists worldwide are eager to share their love of computer science with your students and help them learn more about what a career in tech could look like. [Invite a guest speaker to your classroom today and use our online map](https://code.org/volunteer/local) to find and contact volunteers in your area to visit your classroom or host a webinar for your class.*

Did your students enjoy Hour of Code? The activities are up year round. We have [over 200 tutorials and lesson plans](https://hourofcode.com/us) ready for any classroom. No matter your subject area, hardware need, or experience level, every student can find a new challenge.

Computer science is key to opening so many doors for students in today’s world, and this movement is just getting started, thanks to you! Half a million passionate teachers like you have already [signed up on Code.org](https://code.org/) to make sure students have every opportunity to succeed. Take another step to grow K-12 computer science today!

Congrats on an awesome year and have a great summer!
