Dear <%= name_s %>,

Thank you for helping us measure the impact of the Hour of Code by having your students take a pre- and post-survey about their attitudes toward computer science. Your students helped us learn that after just one Hour of Code:

* More students reported liking computer science
* More students reported feeling they are able to learn computer science
* More students reported feeling they are better at computer science than their peers

These findings were especially true for female students. You can [read more](https://code.org/about/evaluation/hourofcode) about the findings on our website. 

#### To thank you for your participation, here is your $10.00 iTunes gift code.
