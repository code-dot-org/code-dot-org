<p>
I want to update you on our efforts to bring computer science to every student, in every school. A lot has happened in the last 6 months. Marking the 2-year anniversary of our very first hire this month, here’s more on our progress, thanks to your support:
</p>
<h2>
1) Increasing diversity in computer science</h2>
<p>
43% of active coders on our platform <a href="https://studio.code.org/">Code Studio</a> are female. 37% are black or Hispanic.</p>

<p>
The College Board recently reported early AP exam stats, and <a href="http://blog.code.org/post/123032125688/apcs-2015">computer science is now the fastest-growing AP exam of the 2010s</a>. Amazing! But it's still only taught in 5% of US high schools.
</p>
<h2>
2) Creating fantastic online curriculum and spreading it to teachers</h2>
<p>
10% of all US students in grades K-8 have accounts on <a href="http://studio.code.org/">Code Studio</a>! With now 5.9M student accounts, 10,000 new students sign up each day and 10,000 new teachers sign up each month. Overall, growth is driven by teacher-to-teacher referrals, boosted by the <a href="http://hourofcode.com/">Hour of Code</a>.

<p>
<h3>Introducing App Lab</h3></p>
<p>
This week, we also unveiled a preview of our new high school course, Computer Science Principles, which includes a new tool for making and sharing apps: <a href="http://code.org/applab">App Lab</a>.<br>

<h2>3) Training teachers and adding computer science to schools</h2>
<p>
In May, we announced a <a href="https://code.org/college-board">landmark alliance with the College Board</a>, to bring our curriculum to more schools together and help more students access computer science, who may never try it otherwise.
</p>
<p>
Code.org now has 71 school district partners, and 10,000 teachers have attended our training workshops to begin teaching CS. We’re encouraged to see teachers give our workshops the highest ratings: 94% recommend it, 85% say it’s the best training they've ever had. <b>Please help in your area: <a href="http://code.org/k5">ask an elementary school teacher</a> you know to attend a workshop (at no cost!).

<h2>
4) Advocacy gains accelerating
</h2>
<p>
Our advocacy coalition has helped 16 states adjust graduation policies to recognize computer science as an academic field, not just an elective. Now we’re helping states pass comprehensive policies to increase access to computer science.</p>
<p>
<h3>In just the past 3 months:
</h3>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Arkansas:</b>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/03/arkansas-computer-science/">passed a law (plus funding) requiring every high school to teach CS</a></li>
<li><b>Washington state:&nbsp;</b><a href="http://blog.code.org/post/122951279913/wa-budget">allocated $40M to expand access to computer science</a></li>
<li><b>Maryland:</b>&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.code.org/post/121123281798/md">changed policies that should triple diversity in computer science</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
At the city level, <b>San Francisco schools</b><a href="http://www.sfusd.edu/en/news/current-news/2015-news-archive/06/board-approves-plans-to-expand-computer-science-curriculum-to-all-grades.html"> voted to bring computer science to every student in every grade</a>. But still, most schools around the country don't offer computer science.</p>
