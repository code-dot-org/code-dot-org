### Yes! You pledged to go beyond an hour to expand computer science at your school.

Thank you for joining the movement! We want to help you go further.

### Administrators
If you’re a district or school administrator, see our [Administrator Guide](https://<%= codedotorg %>/administrators) for expanding access in your school or district.

### Teachers
If you’re a teacher, view our curriculum and professional learning options for [teaching computer science](https://<%= studiodotcodedotorg %>/courses?view=teacher) to your students - no computer science experience necessary.

We also have [resources to help you advocate](https://<%= codedotorg %>/promote) for the need for computer science in your area.

Thank you for being a leader in pledging to expand offerings at your school. You will make real lasting change in students’ lives by giving them the opportunity to take these courses. 
 
Please follow our progress on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Code.org) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/codeorg) to stay in touch.
 
Thank you so much for your support,

Hadi Partovi<br />
