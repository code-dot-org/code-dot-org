You were one of the first 20,000 educators to attend a Code.org workshop. I hope you’re having fun with [Code Studio](https://studio.code.org/) in your classroom.

### Help us spread the word
Most workshop attendees ranked it the best professional development ever! If you had a good experience, *please* spread the word. (If you didn’t, reply with feedback. I can’t respond to every note, but we’ll read it.)

- [Find upcoming local workshops](http://code.org/professional-development-workshops)
- Email another elementary school teacher ([use this sample email](http://code.org/educate/k5/resources))
- [Share on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?hashtags=CSforAll&related=codeorg&text=I'm%20bringing%20computer%20science%20to%20my%20classroom.%20Find%20a%20local%20workshop%20to%20join%20me&url=http%3A%2F%2Fcode.org/k5) or Facebook

Thank you for leading the movement to give all our children the opportunity to learn foundational skills. Let’s keep it going!
