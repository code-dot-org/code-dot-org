Dear Elementary Teacher:

Code.org needs your help in understanding how you are using the K-5 Code.org courses. As you know, you are among the first to use these courses. Your input will help us make them better for you and other teachers in the future. 

We encourage you to be honest; this questionnaire is being administered by our external evaluators, so Code.org will not know how you, as an individual, responded.

**How you can help: Take [this survey](http://tinyurl.com/CodeOrgElementary2015) about your Code Studio experience: http://tinyurl.com/CodeOrgElementary2015**

If you complete the survey, you will be entered into a drawing to win one of 25 gift cards, worth $20 each!

Please do this as soon as possible!
