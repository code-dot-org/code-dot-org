Due to high demand, we've added a limited number of spots to our Professional Learning Program for computer science, and want to invite you to participate. Apply by **March 31** to secure your spot. 

**97% of workshop attendees ranked our program as the best professional development ever**

### Bring a full-year course to your high school: 

You can participate and begin teaching computer science — absolutely no prior experience is required to teach our courses, CS Principles and Exploring Computer Science. 

For teachers participating in the CS Principles Professional Learning Program, you'll get an all-expenses-paid trip to our program kickoff, TeacherCon (in Salt Lake City, Atlanta, or Chicago), and ongoing support throughout the school year. Exploring Computer Science teachers will attend workshops held locally in your region. 

**CS Principles:** [Sign up for the professional learning program](https://code.org/educate/professional-learning/cs-principles)

**Exploring Computer Science:** [Sign up for the professional learning program](https://code.org/educate/professional-learning/exploring-cs)

*"This is my 18th year of teaching and CSP is the best curriculum I have ever implemented."*

*"It was absolutely rich and the most meaningful training I have ever attended in 16 years of teaching."*
