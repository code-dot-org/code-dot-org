You’re one of the first engineers to sign up to volunteer to help a classroom during their Hour of Code — **thank you**.

### 3,245 volunteers have signed up.

### But 12,376 teachers want technical volunteers to help with their Hour of Code in December.

#### Can you ask someone you know to join you?
Please share this opportunity with coworkers, friends or classmates. Ask them to volunteer for one hour at [https://code.org/volunteer](https://code.org/volunteer). 

When you sign up, local teachers will be able to find you and ask for help (we’ll never share your contact information). You can [check out our Hour of Code tutorials](https://code.org/learn) for all ages to see what students will be learning, but keep in mind: our most exciting lessons yet are coming in a few weeks!

#### Most students don’t ever get to try computer science. We can change that. 

This is an opportunity to meet students face-to-face, share your story, and inspire young people in your area to keep learning to code. 

Let’s help every teacher get a volunteer. Get one more engineer to sign up.

Thank you for your support,

Hadi Partovi<br />
Founder, Code.org
