Hi friends, 

## The Hour of Code is coming again!

The [Hour of Code movement](https://hourofcode.com/) keeps changing the world. It’s reached every Apple Store worldwide, the White House, 300 partners, and more than 100 million students in 180 countries. 

**The Hour of Code is a challenge:** Try learning to code for just one hour and prove that anybody can learn the basics.

This year can really be a turning point for computer science in our schools — with new tutorials, new prizes, and an ambitious new goal for December 7-13. **Can you get involved?**

## Together, we want to reach 100,000 events
I hope you’ll join us to prove anybody can learn, and every young person deserves to learn how to build technology that will impact everything in their future. *Every* organizer will receive a gift card to Amazon or Microsoft’s Windows Store as a thank-you gift. 

## How can you help?
- Ask your school to participate
- Host your own Hour of Code event
- Or take an hour to learn yourself

[Here’s how to get involved](https://hourofcode.com/promote)

## Worldwide, in 40 languages
Hour of Code activities are available in more than 40 languages. We need your help to reach schools where students or teachers don’t speak English.
<% end %>

## Computer science is foundational for every 21st-century student
Most schools still don’t teach it. We owe it to our children to start with just one hour.
