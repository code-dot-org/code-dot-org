---

In 2014, the Hour of Code was [launched from the White House](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_dayIQWV4), and with the help of high school students President Obama became the first U.S. president to write a line of code.

In 2015, the kick-off was [on Wall Street](http://business.nasdaq.com/discover/market-bell-ceremonies/detail.html#!/!?ceremonyId=4987), with students opening the stock market.

**Now, it's 2016. And one lucky classroom in Canada will get to participate in a top-secret, historic Hour of Code kick off event.** 

The details are confidential, but if you want a chance to give your students a very special opportunity, [register your Hour of Code event now](https://hourofcode.com/#join)! One lucky class in Canada will be selected from the list of this year's organizers.
