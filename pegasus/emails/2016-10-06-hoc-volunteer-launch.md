Hi <%= name_s %>,

We’re following up because we received some questions about volunteering during the [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com), our annual campaign to introduce computer science to *every* student during Computer Science Education Week, December 5th-11th.

<h3>Join us for a volunteer webinar.</h3>
We’re hosting a [Volunteer Training Webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZWz5XX5PXk) on Wednesday, October 12 @ 12pm PT / 3pm ET. Please join us for more information on how you can inspire students through the Hour of Code, and to ask any questions you have during a Q&A session.

<h3>What other resources are available for volunteers?</h3>
As a reminder, you can [review this toolkit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PcrOW44tq_leRIAUWeUDy-gdrLJGIUNBB_feXF8b9w0/edit#heading=h.x1s6hunmhamh) about how to coordinate with teachers once they contact you from the [volunteer map](https://code.org/volunteer/local), things to do and share with the classroom, and what to expect when you volunteer. 

You can also reach out directly to a school in your area or to other organizations such as the [Girl Scouts](http://www.girlscouts.org/en/adults/volunteer.html), [Boy Scouts](https://beascout.scouting.org/Volunteer.aspx), or [Boys & Girls Club of America](http://greatfutures.org/pages/) and offer to help them organize an event. You can also [host your own Hour of Code event](http://hourofcode.com/#join)!

<h3>We hope you're ready to change students' lives :-)</h3>
Check out these awesome testimonials from last year's Hour of Code volunteers: 

> <em>“The best part of my experience was that the entire class were women and people of color. It bodes well for the future of our industry to have a chance to reach and excite these kids.”</em>
>

</br>

> <em>“I LOVED seeing how excited the kids were. Students who didn’t do as well academically were excelling at thinking like a developer. [Hour of Code] gave them a place to feel confident.”</em>

Thank you, again, for supporting this movement and for making a difference in your community’s schools. I hope to [talk to you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZWz5XX5PXk) next week!
