Today over 50 [top business and education leaders](https://code.org/washington) — from Microsoft, Amazon and Starbucks to the Chamber of Commerce and University of Washington — join forces, [calling for legislation to expand computer science](https://code.org/washington) in schools throughout the state.

#### Please, add your support — [Ask your reps to support change](http://www.congressweb.com/code/11)

Our state is considering a comprehensive policy that would establish education standards for computer science and match private funding to train teachers.

Right now there are 20,000 open computing jobs *across all industries* in Washington. These jobs are growing at 3x the state average. But 90% of schools don’t offer computer science. This is a problem we can solve.

Most importantly, **every** student today should have the opportunity to learn how technology works.

**[Ask your reps to support HB 1813](http://www.congressweb.com/code/11)**

In 2013, Washington led 15 other states to allow computer science to count for high school graduation. Today’s our chance to lead again.
