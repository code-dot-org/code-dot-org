Hi <%= name %>,

We're so excited to share that more than 13,000 of you have signed up to volunteer for the [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com) this year, December 5-11! Thank you for doing your part in this movement. Together, you will all impact **thousands** of classrooms. 

**You may begin to receive requests for help from teachers in your area soon, so be on the lookout for emails!**

<h3>Here’s what you should expect:</h3>

1. Teachers can now search for volunteers in their area; they’ll be able to find you and the information you shared with us on [this worldwide map](http://code.org/volunteer/local).</li>

2. If a teacher would like your help with their Hour of Code, they will contact you through an online form. You will receive an email from me (Tanya at Code.org) sharing the teacher’s message and full contact information.</li>

3. [Review this toolkit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PcrOW44tq_leRIAUWeUDy-gdrLJGIUNBB_feXF8b9w0/edit#heading=h.x1s6hunmhamh) about how to coordinate with the teacher(s), things to do and share with the classroom, and what to expect when you volunteer.</li></ol>

<h3>What if you aren't contacted?</h3>

Keep in mind that if you’re in a large city or technical hub, you may not be contacted due to the high number of volunteer signups in your area. If this is the case, instead of waiting to be contacted, I recommend reaching out directly to a school in your area, or to other organizations such as the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts or [Boys & Girls Club of America](http://greatfutures.org/). 

You can also [host your own Hour of Code event](http://hourofcode.com)! 

Students are so fortunate to have so many willing volunteers like you to inspire them during their Hour of Code. Thank you for supporting this movement!
