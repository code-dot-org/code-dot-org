Megan first tried computer science when her 6th grade class did the Hour of Code. She never thought about coding before, but now she’s taking classes at a local university, and reimagining her whole future! 

With your support, we’ve introduced 45 million students to an Hour of Code, and established courses in 50,000 classrooms worldwide, including in your neighborhood.

Every student should have the opportunity Megan did. That’s why Code.org has launched an ambitious crowdfunding campaign to make this vision a reality. **[Donate now](http://igg.me/at/hourofcode/x/9005878)**

### Only $180,000 away from breaking a record
This week, foundations set up by Code.org major supporters Mark Zuckerberg, John Doerr, and Rich Barton generously donated over $1 millon to our campaign. We’re now close to becoming the largest campaign in Indiegogo history!

Please [help us break the record](http://igg.me/at/hourofcode/x/9005878) and raise enough funds to introduce 100 million students to one Hour of Code, and to prepare 10,000 teachers to offer full computer science classes. We're halfway to our overall goal!

### Every dollar matched: unlock funds that double your impact
Generous donors have offered to match **every dollar you donate. Your donation will unlock this investment in our children’s future.** Plus, we have fun perks to thank you in return!

Every child deserves the chance to learn foundational 21st century skills.
