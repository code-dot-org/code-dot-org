## 70 million down, 30 million to go

When the Hour of Code launched a year ago, we had no idea how fast it would spread. To date, 70M students have tried the Hour of Code.

This week, across 180 countries, millions of people are learning new skills that can change the rest of their lives. The Hour of Code 2014 is already **twice as big as last year**!

(The tutorials are available in over 30 languages and taught in 180+ countries, [try one now](https://code.org/learn/)!)

Halfway through the week, 15 million students [have tried the Hour of Code around the world](http://code.org/) — including a pretty special student, the President of the United States.

Barack Obama became the first US President to program a computer, to show that *anybody* start learning computer science. And in a video message to kick off the Hour of Code, he [urged every young person to learn more about how technology works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDw1ii7aKwg) this week. [Watch him write his first line of code](http://youtu.be/AI_dayIQWV4).

**A note about our website performance**<br />
On Monday and Tuesday, many of you had trouble with the Code.org website. I’m so sorry, and appreciate your patience. We planned for extreme traffic, and got hit with even more. After sleepless nights from our engineering team, I’m confident it will be smooth sailing the rest of the week. 
<% end %>

**Thank you**<br />
I can’t believe our ambitious goal to reach 100M students is in reach. We’re seeing a sea-change in education and it’s thanks to the collective effort of [200 partners](https://code.org/about/partners/)... and you. Your personal stories and support have made this the best job I could ever imagine.

We’ve been deluged by requests about our hat that’s been worn by celebrities and even the president. If you [buy our t-shirts and hats](https://code.org/shop/), wear them with pride.

**P.S.**<br />
Our crowdfunding campaign has **3 days to reach our $5M goal**! We’ll use the funds to bring computer science to 25,000 new classrooms by 2016. For each dollar you give, one student will learn. [Please support our work](https://code.org/donate/).
