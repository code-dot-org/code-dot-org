You have canceled your registration for the Code.org K-5 workshop with <%= affiliate[:name] %> on <%= workshop['dates'].map{|i| "#{i['date_s']} (#{i['start_time_s']} - #{i['end_time_s']})"}.join(', ') %> at <%= workshop['location_name_s'] %>.

Weâ€™re sorry to hear you can no longer attend. You can sign up for a different workshop [here](http://<%=CDO.canonical_hostname('code.org')%>/professional-development-workshops).

Or check out our free, self-paced [online workshop](https://code.org/educate/professional-development-online) to get started.

If this is a mistake and you did not mean to cancel your workshop registration, contact your facilitator at <%= affiliate[:name] %> - <%= affiliate[:email] %>.
