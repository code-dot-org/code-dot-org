This is an email I wish I never had to send. 

Some personal data was accessed on our web site by a firm exploiting a client-side vulnerability. Your email address and your location, if you provided it, were compromised and may have been read. 

The exploit was limited to engineers and others who volunteered to help in classrooms. No student or teacher accounts were impacted, nor passwords or additional information. The exploit did not give hackers access to any of our servers.

Earlier this week, a volunteer engineer told us he received an unsolicited recruiting email from a technical freelancing firm in Singapore. We determined the firm was able to retrieve the volunteer’s private email address by exploiting a client-side vulnerability on our volunteer map. We’ve since had 6 similar cases reported. 

We’ve fixed the problem, and all private data was secured against future attacks late Friday. We also inspected and secured the rest of our site from similar vulnerabilities.

We’ve reached out to the overseas firm which sent the recruiting emails.They apologized and promised to not send any future emails and to delete all the email addresses they collected. Based on their response, it’s possible the vulnerability may have had limited impact, but we can’t be sure. If you receive any future solicitations which identify you as a Code.org volunteer, please notify us right away.  

At Code.org, we take privacy and security very seriously. Unfortunately we live in a time when security breaches are all too common. In the case of our youngest learners - students under the age of 13 - we don't store their email address even if they give it to us, as an added precaution. 

We apologize deeply for the inconvenience this has caused. I’m personally committed to making sure our team understands the gravity of this issue, to ensure it doesn’t happen again.
