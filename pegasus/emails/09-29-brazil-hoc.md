Next week, thousands of classrooms across Latin America will learn their first [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com/br), jumping into a field that can change the rest of their lives!

### Double your impact: ask one other teacher to join
Please, ask one other teacher in your school to host an [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com/br) next week.

### Here’s what you need to know now to make your Hour of Code a success:

**1) Choose your tutorials**

Choose a tutorial for your students. Complete it once yourself now, so you’ll be ready to lead your class and answer questions. 

**2) Print certificates and student artwork**
 
Generate and print certificates in bulk [here](https://code.org/certificates). If you use our *Artist tutorial with Anna and Elsa*, you’ll be able to print your students’ artwork too.

### Prizes for **EVERY** organizer
Every organizer who registers their event on [Hour of Code](http://hourofcode.com/br) will be eligible to receive 10gb of Dropbox space. 

Thank you for being part of this movement, 

Hadi Partovi,
Founder, Code.org
