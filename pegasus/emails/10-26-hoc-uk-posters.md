Dear UK Hour of Code organizer,

Great news! We are now able to send Hour of Code posters to organizers in the United Kingdom. If you'd like one, to help excite students and promote your event, let us know. 

**[Request an inspirational poster](https://docs.google.com/a/code.org/forms/d/117rf_1OZBVS2tbKMkVMqVQyQv_SHA2hsoMkDwwU3L-c/viewform)**

The first 1,500 UK organizers to complete the request form will receive one Hour of Code poster, a participation guide, and stickers for students in the mail. 

The Hour of Code is just six weeks away. Thank you for being part of this movement.

Hadi Partovi<br />
