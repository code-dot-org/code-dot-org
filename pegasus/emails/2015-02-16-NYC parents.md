Computer science can open up more doors for our children than any other discipline in today’s world. But a lot of schools still don’t even offer it. 

Help Code.org bring computer science courses to your school — at no cost to teachers or schools. We’re preparing NYC teachers to offer computer science, for all levels — kindergarten through high school. 

### How you can help

- Ask your teacher or principal to get involved (see [sample letter](http://code.org/promote/nycletter))
- Know a private school teacher? [Use this letter](http://code.org/promote/letter)
- Want to do more? See [other ways to help](http://code.org/help)

This is a chance to give your children access to foundational 21st-century skills.
