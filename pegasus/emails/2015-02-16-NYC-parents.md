Dear NYC parent,

Computer science can open up more doors for our children than any other discipline in today’s world. But a lot of schools still don’t even offer it.

Code.org has partnered with NYC schools to prepare teachers to offer computer science, for all levels — kindergarten through high school. Help us bring computer science courses to your school — at no cost to teachers or schools.

### What can your children learn?

**Elementary school:** Short, online modules that students absolutely love<br />
**Middle school:** Computer science activities integrated into any science class<br />
**High school:** An inclusive, year-long introductory computer science course<br />

### How you can bring computer science to your child’s NYC school:

- Ask your teacher or principal to get involved (see [sample letter](http://code.org/promote/nycletter))
- Know a private school teacher? [Use this letter](http://code.org/promote/letter)
- Want to do more? See [other ways to help](http://code.org/help)

This is a chance to give your children access to foundational 21st-century skills.
