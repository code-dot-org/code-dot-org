You joined as a teacher on Code.org’s learning platform, Code Studio. Take the next step to add computer science to your classroom once a week and let your students explore the limitless bounds of computing. [Our free elementary school curriculum](https://code.org/educate/curriculum/elementary-school) blends online, self-guided and self-paced tutorials with "unplugged" activities that require no computer at all.

We offer [free one-day workshops](https://code.org/professional-development-workshops) for K-5 educators to help you get started. If you’re curious about technology and want the skills to teach your students more about building it, I want to invite you to participate. **All costs are covered by Code.org**.
