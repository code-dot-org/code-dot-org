Thank you for your interest in Code.org’s Professional Learning Program! We’re excited to let you know that our applications to join the program for CS Discoveries and CS Principles are now open. 

Code.org’s Professional Learning Program is an intensive, year-long professional learning program for middle and high school educators who are interested in teaching Code.org’s CS Discoveries (middle school) or CS Principles (high school) courses. These programs are designed to prepare educators to provide high quality instruction based on the curriculum, tools and approach to students in their classrooms. Due to the popularity of the program, we prioritize teachers who teach in regions that are currently served by our [Regional Partners.] (https://code.org/educate/regional-partner/partners)
 
 Teachers who apply and are accepted to the program commit to:
 
 * Attending the five-day, in-person summer workshop (dates and locations assigned by district)
 * Attending four local one-day, in person workshops (normally on Saturdays)
 * Engaging in 20 hours of on-line PD
 * Teaching the course during the 2017-18 school year
 * Supporting the recruitment and enrollment of a diverse group of students in the course, represnetative of the school's overall student population

 Applications close on March 17, and will be reveiwed on a rolling basis. To apply now, visit the [CS Discoveries](https://code.org/educate/professional-learning/cs-discoveries) and [CS Principles](https://code.org/educate/professional-learning/cs-principles) pages. We look forward to reviewing your application!
