### Thanks for signing up to host an Hour of Code!
As a thank you for helping make it possible for students to start learning computer science, we'd like to give you a [free set of 12 professionally printed posters featuring diverse role models for your classroom](https://<%= storedotcodedotorg %>/products/code-org-posters-set-of-12). Use offer code FREEPOSTERS at checkout. (This code is good through 12/31 while supplies last. Since these posters ship from the United States, shipping costs can be quite high if shipping to Canada and internationally. We understand that this may not be in your budget, and we encourage you to print the [PDF files](https://<%= hourofcode %>/promote/resources#posters) for your classroom.)

<% if form.data["hoc_event_country_s"] == 'US' %>
Thanks to the generosity of Ozobot, Dexter Industries, littleBits, and Wonder Workshop, over 100 classrooms will be selected to receive robots or circuits for their class! To be eligible to receive a set, make sure to complete the survey sent from Code.org after the Hour of Code. Code.org will select the winning classrooms. Please note that this is only open for US schools.

Hour of Code runs December 4-10. We'll be in touch about new tutorials and other exciting updates as they come out. **In the meantime, what can you do now?**

### 1. Find a local volunteer to help you with your event.
[Search our volunteer map](https://<%= codedotorg %>/volunteer/local) for volunteers who can visit your classroom or video chat remotely to inspire your students about the breadth of possibilities with computer science.

### 2. Spread the word & recruit your whole school
We need your help to reach organizers worldwide. Tell your friends about the #HourOfCode. [Use these helpful resources](https://<%= hourofcode %>/promote/resources) to promote your event.

Help recruit more people from your school and community by [sending our sample emails](https://<%= hourofcode %>/promote/resources#sample-emails) to your principal, a local group, or even some friends.

### 3. Start planning your event
Choose an [Hour of Code activity](https://<%= hourofcode %>/learn) for your classroom and [review this how-to guide](https://<%= hourofcode %>/how-to).

### From an Hour of Code to years of computer science
<% if form.data["hoc_event_country_s"] == 'US' %>
An Hour of Code is just the beginning. Whether you are an administrator, teacher, or advocate, we have [professional learning, curriculum, and resources to help you bring computer science classes to your school or expand your offerings.](https://<%= codedotorg %>/yourschool) If you already teach computer science, use these resources during CS Education Week to rally support from your administration, parents, and community.

You have many choices to fit your school. Most of the organizations offering Hour of Code tutorials also have curriculum and professional learning available. If you find a lesson you like, ask about going further. To help you get started, we've highlighted a number of [curriculum providers that will help you or your students go beyond an hour.](https://<%= hourofcode %>/beyond)
