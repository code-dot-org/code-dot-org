I’m writing to let you know that Code.org has partnered with Houston Independent School District to bring computer science to your school, at all levels — kindergarten through high school. 

### Get started with high-quality professional development — at no cost to you or your school

Incorporate computer science into elementary and middle school, or offer a year-long course in high school. Participating teachers consistently call our professional development, "The best professional development I've ever had!"

**For elementary schools:**

- Short, online curriculum modules that students absolutely love
- 1-day workshops for teachers (plus librarians, tech ed specialists, etc.)<br />
