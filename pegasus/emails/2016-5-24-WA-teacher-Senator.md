<strong>Be part of the biggest opportunity for computer science education, ever.</strong>

Congress is debating whether to allocate funding that would be distributed by the Department of Education directly to local education authorities. This support for K-12 computer science could <strong>directly benefit your district</strong>.

U.S. Senator Patty Murray has the power to help secure this funding. We are sending her a letter from teachers here in Washington state, asking for her support.

<strong>[Please add your voice](https://docs.google.com/a/code.org/forms/d/14AXa65cYoWj_4fR4KIkDizNJjhjMK3xqo5g4ved6t1s/viewform)—help us show Senator Murray  that computer science is important to Washington state teachers!</strong> Add your name to the list of teacher signatures on this letter <strong>by May 27</strong>.

Thank you! Please contact me if I can answer any questions.

Warmly,<br>
Nimisha
