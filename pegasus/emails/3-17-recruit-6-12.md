subject: "Did you have a good experience?"

You were one of the first teachers to participate in Code.org professional development. Thanks to your leadership, students in your classroom — and in 100 school districts across the country — are learning foundational computer science skills that will set them up for success in any career.

**With your help**, we can prepare even more students for 21st-century futures, starting with our youngest learners. 

## Help us spread the word - enrollment open now
Any K-12 teacher can learn how to bring computer science to their students with our [professional learning programs](https://code.org/educate), at no cost. If you’re having a good experience, please ask one teacher you know (at your school or in your district) to join our programs. (If you aren't having a good experience, please reply with feedback. I can't respond to every note, but we'll read it and we'll use your feedback to improve the program.)

Encourage another teacher to sign up now to reserve a space. First round enrollment for next year's Professional Learning Program is open through the end of March. 

- Ask a **high school teacher** to teach an inclusive [intro computer science course](http://code.org/highschool)
- Ask a **middle school teacher** to incorporate computer science activities into [any math or science class](http://code.org/middleschool)
- Ask an **elementary school teacher** to [attend a local workshop](https://code.org/professional-development-workshops) to use our short, fun courses (use [this sample email](https://code.org/educate/professional-learning/cs-fundamentals-resources#teacherstoteachers))
