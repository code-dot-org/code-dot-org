Three years ago, educators united across the globe to teach computer science in their classrooms for a single hour. Today, this movement has reached hundreds of thousands of teachers. 10% of all the world’s students have tried [an Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com), and many of their teachers have taken things further: teaching year-long computer science courses and changing curriculum for their entire school, district, city or country to include this critical subject.

We often criticize schools for not doing enough, but when it comes to embracing coding and computer science, these teachers deserve our gratitude.

Even [the President has joined the movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_dayIQWV4), with [politicians from both parties](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgn_YbSmHnw) calling on schools to teach computer science. When it comes to embracing coding and computer science, America’s teachers are leading the world.

As we kick off the 2016 Hour of Code campaign, I want to thank you—whether you [signed](http://code.org/promote) a petition, [bought](http://code.org/shop) a t-shirt, [donated](http://code.org/donate) to support the effort, or [volunteered](http://code.org/volunteer) in a classroom, you’ve helped build the largest movement in the history of education.

For this year’s Hour of Code, we want to expand participation by the community, and we want more schools to join the movement to grow their computer science programs beyond just one hour. We have [a whole new set of activities](http://code.org/learn), designed to engage every teacher, at all grade and experience levels.

<h3>To grow the movement, start with an Hour of Code:</h3>

- Tell teachers to [host an Hour of Code in their classrooms](https://hourofcode.com#join)—or host an event yourself!
- [Register to volunteer](https://code.org/volunteer) and inspire students in a local classroom (or remotely via video)
- Promote the campaign at your workplace, using [these materials](https://hourofcode.com/promote).
- Spread the word on social media. Share [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsOIlDT145A).

<h3>Help our schools teach computer science beyond an Hour of Code:</h3>

If you’re a parent, ask your child’s school to take steps to offer [a year-long computer science program](http://code.org/educate). Computer science isn’t just about teaching students to code. It exercises critical thinking skills, project-based creative learning, and prepares children for the 21st century.

If you’re a parent, ask your child’s school to take steps to offer [a year-long computer science program](http://code.org/educate). 90% of parents want our children to learn computer science, and teachers are answering this call nationwide. We hope principals hear the message too. Here’s [a sample letter](http://code.org/promote/letter) you can write your principal, and here’s [an entire presentation](https://code.org/files/computer_science_advocacy.pptx) to show at a PTA or school board event.

Thank you again for your support. This movement has only been possible because of you. And I especially thank our partners, and generous donors such as Microsoft, Facebook, Infosys, Google, and others who have joined forces behind the vision that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science.
