### The Hour of Code 2014

<% if domestic %>

Last year, 40,000 teachers led a grassroots effort called the [Hour of Code](http://hourofcode.com) – to introduce ten million students to one hour of computer science. Kids of all ages tried one hour of writing code and making apps in classrooms, and they loved it.

This year, supported by over 100 organizations, we want you to help reach 100 million students, across every country in the world, during Computer Science Education Week (Dec 8 – 14).

### What’s an Hour of Code?
It’s an introduction to computer science designed to show that anyone can learn the basics. Code.org provides hour-long tutorials featuring Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Angry Birds and Plants vs. Zombies — for your computer, tablet, smartphone or with no computer at all!

### Computer science is foundational for all students
Yet 90% of schools don’t teach it. We owe it to our children to give them one hour.
