Your students are already glued to computers, games, and apps. And we all know technology will shape everything about their futures.

If you want the skills to teach how tech works and how to take part in building it, you can introduce computer science to your classroom with fantastic curriculum and professional learning for teachers of all backgrounds. No prior experience with computer science is required and it’s at <b><u>no cost to you or your school</u></b>. 

## High school:

Teach year-long AP Computer Science Principles courses that introduce students to computer science through an inquiry and equity-based lense. If you’re a NYC DOE teacher, you’ve got two great curriculum options:

### Code.org's CS Principles:<br />
*Every* NYC DOE Teacher that participated this year said they would recommend this PD to others. [Sign up for the professional learning program](https://code.org/educate/professional-learning/cs-principles).
