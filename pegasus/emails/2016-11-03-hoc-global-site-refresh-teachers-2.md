<h3>The Hour of Code is coming during Computer Science Education Week: December 5-11!</h3>


<% if category == 'signup2016' %>
Thank you for signing up to host an Hour of Code this year! You were among the first to register your event. Your support is helping this movement go even further—and the Hour of Code has already gone pretty far. It’s been to the White House, to 180 countries, to Apple and Microsoft stores around the world, and more!

<h3>What’s new for this year?</h3>

We’re very excited to announce that [our list of Hour of Code activities](http://code.org/learn) has just been refreshed with new content, an updated look, and a filter tool that will allow you to find the best activity for your classroom. 


<a href="http://code.org/learn"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdo-email-images/tutorial-preview.jpg" width="100%"/></a>


Some cool things about this refresh:

- We’ve expanded our selection to include *over 200 tutorials and lesson plans* that introduce students to computer science in a variety of ways. Have fun exploring!

- Has your class done the Hour of Code before? Maybe they’re even experts at certain puzzles. *No problem.* Use our new filters to discover more challenging activities that fit all grade and experience levels!

- There are tons of other ways to filter activities, too: find offline tutorials, and activities that work with robots, iPads, Androids, and whatever other hardware your class has!

- Want to connect computer science to social studies, math, or another subject? Use the new topic filter to find subject-specific activities. And encourage other subject area teachers at your school to sign up and try it in their classrooms too.

- There are more updates to come through November, including *a few surprise activities* that your students will love. Follow us [@teachcode](http://twitter.com/teachcode) to get the latest!


For those who have never done the Hour of Code before, the basics of the campaign are still the same: *Anybody* can learn, *no experience* required, and it only takes an hour. But for veteran teachers, there are now lesson plans that let you guide students through more complicated activities. 

We hope that our broad selection of activities will enable both newcomers and veterans to get the most out of their Hour of Code. This year, make an Hour of Code that is truly your own!

<h3>Inspire your classroom with a local volunteer</h3>

<a href="https://code.org/volunteer/local"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdo-email-images/volunteer-map.png" width="80%"/></a>

Invite a local volunteer to inspire your students by talking about the breadth of possibilities in computer science. There are thousands of volunteers around the world ready to help with your Hour of Code. [Use this map](https://code.org/volunteer/local) to find local volunteers who can visit your classroom or join a video chat with your students.


<small>Notice: Code.org hasn't vetted volunteers listed on the map and makes no assurances about them. We simply offer a matching service, and Hour of Code planners should do their own background checks in compliance with local policies.</small>

<h3>Help spread computer science beyond the Hour of Code</h3>
Does your school have a robust computer science program? If not, you can use the Hour of Code to lead the charge to bring computer science to your school! Try one of the following during the week of December 5-11:

- Announce a plan to launch a computer science program at your school or district
- Recruit other teachers to launch computer science classes by touring [code.org/educate](http://code.org/educate) with them
- Use Hour of Code to broaden participation in computer science across different classrooms and subjects

Thank you again for your support. This movement has only been possible because of you. Have fun planning your Hour of Code this December.
