Thank you for hosting an Hour of Code this year. **We have an exciting opportunity for those of you who just organized an Hour of Code event!** Four generous partners have donated over a thousand robotics packages to distribute to lucky classrooms. 

Help us by [giving your feedback on the Hour of Code](https://goo.gl/forms/XwiyJnjGJ2Qpv76E2) and you could receive a kit from Ozobot, Sphero, Wonder Workshop or BirdBrain Technologies for your classroom! Robot recipients will be chosen at random from all survey submissions. A big thank you to these partners for supporting the campaign.

All we need is 10 minutes of your time to help us inform future Hour of Code campaigns. No matter how you did the Hour of Code, we want to know how it went and count your participation. **[Please complete the survey](https://goo.gl/forms/XwiyJnjGJ2Qpv76E2) before it closes on Friday, January 6!**

<h3>Going beyond one hour</h3> 
Did your students love the Hour of Code and want to learn more? Even if your school doesn’t offer computer science courses, Code.org can help you implement a full program for any grade. 

For teachers in grades K-5, we offer high-quality, [1-day workshops](http://code.org/k5), free of charge. For middle school and high school, we work with districts and other partners across the US to prepare teachers to offer year-long computer science courses. [Find your grade band here](https://code.org/educate) and explore free curriculum offerings and workshops in your area! Or check out [offerings by our partners](http://code.org/educate/3rdparty). 

You helped us introduce millions of students to computer science this year.  Thousands of teachers used the #HourOfCode hashtag on social media—check out some highlights on our [Hour Of Code Twitter Moment](https://twitter.com/i/moments/803745761305296896)!

In a world where technology is changing everything, teachers like you are ensuring that computer science becomes a part of foundational learning. You’re helping us give students everywhere the chance to learn.
