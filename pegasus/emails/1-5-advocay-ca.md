Hi,

In California, computer science doesn’t count towards college admission requirements, and as a result, most schools still don't offer it. 

We’re making great progress. Schools across the state are adding computer science classes - from Los Angeles to San Francisco to Oakland. Governor Brown and the State Legislature have passed new laws to expand access to computer science. But students won’t take these classes if they don’t count for graduation or for university admissions. 

To make computer science count, the ultimate decision rests with the University of California Board of Admissions and Relations with Schools, and so far they’ve rejected proposals. 

9 out of 10 Californians believe that schools should teach computer science. The University of California needs to hear from you.

Every student should have the opportunity to learn how technology works in today’s world. This is a problem we can solve.
