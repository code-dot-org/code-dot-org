<h3>Welcome to the launch of the 2016 Hour of Code campaign from Ottawa, Canada!</h3>

Today, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau [kicked off](https://www.facebook.com/Code.org/posts/1164649040298064) the global effort to introduce students to computer science with two lucky classrooms that were chosen from tens of millions. The prime minister coded a [simple game](https://studio.code.org/c/298948598) featuring his favorite sport, joining the world’s top athletes that are encouraging students globally to try the Hour of Code in a new Code.org video.

<h3>The world’s champions: “Push yourself. Anybody can Learn”</h3>

We've just released [a new inspirational video](http://code.org/athletes) featuring champions Serena Williams, Neymar Jr, Carmelo Anthony, Draymond Green, Sergio Ramos, Marcelo Vieira, Sue Bird, and gold medalists from Chile to Sri Lanka. Click the image below to watch!

There’s also a companion [coding activity](http://code.org/athletes) students can use to make their own simple sports game. Thanks to a partnership with the NBA, students can code a custom basketball app with their favorite team’s logo. :-)

<h3>Celebrating 300 million served</h3>

<a href="http://hourofcode.com"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdo-email-images/300+million+served.png" width="70%"/></a>

Today marks the 3 year anniversary of the Hour of Code, a teacher-led movement to introduce students to computer science and demystify this foundational 21st century subject. As we prepared to kick off Computer Science Education Week, we passed an amazing milestone: [300 million served in 3 years, and 20 billion lines of code written by students!](http://code.org/loc) In just 3 years, at least *10%* of all students on the planet have tried the Hour of Code. To all the nonprofits, corporations, governments, and hundreds of thousands of amazing educators who support this campaign—you’ve accomplished more than anybody could have imagined.

<h3>Teachers: Your students can chat with me, Code.org founder Hadi Partovi, during the Hour of Code!</h3>

This week, students in any classroom can tune in to livechats and talk with me. It’s a chance for students and educators—brand new or seasoned veterans of computer science—to get inspired, ask questions, and see just how large this computer science education community is. 

We hope to see you during one of these times! The first ten classrooms to join each hangout will get to chat with me—others can watch along. [Learn more and get links to the livechats here.](http://teacherblog.code.org/post/153962352824/students-can-chat-with-hadi-partovi-founder-of)

Tuesday 11:30am ET / 8:30am PT

Wednesday 1pm ET / 10am PT

Thursday 2:30pm ET / 11:30am PT

Friday 2:30pm ET / 11:30am PT

<h3>What matters most comes after the Hour of Code</h3>
One hour is only the beginning. [Most students](https://code.org/about/evaluation/hourofcode) go beyond their first hour once they’re engaged. And tens of thousands of teachers have gone further to teach computer science at their school, using Code.org’s [courses](http://code.org/educate) or with our [partners](http://code.org/educate/3rdparty). The largest US cities, many states, and even entire countries are changing K-12 curriculum to include computer science.

Thank you, thank you, thank you to every parent, volunteer, partner, donor, and most of all the teachers and students who have brought computer science to the forefront of K-12 education globally. Your work is more important today than ever before. Computer science is a subject whose hour has come.
