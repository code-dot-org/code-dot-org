Hello <%= name_s %>,
 
Over 100,000 people, including all the biggest CEOs, 29 governors, and education leaders, have joined together to petition Congress to support computer science in every K-12 school. [If you haven’t signed the petition already, please do!](http://change.org/computerscience)

As a volunteer, you can do even more to bring computer science to more schools. This would be a big commitment, with a big pay-off.
 
[TEALS](http://c.tealsk12.org/l/667) (Technology Education and Literacy in Schools) is a grassroots effort that was started in 2009 by Microsoft employee Kevin Wang. TEALS brings existing teachers together with software engineers from over 200 companies to build sustainable CS classes, nationwide. They’re seeking individuals with CS backgrounds to teach in local high schools. 

To date, TEALS has taught over 17,000 students – over 6,000 of which are AP CS students. They’ve been effective in what they do because of passionate volunteers:

* 90% of TEALS partner schools are able to teach CS on their own at the end of the partnership.
* AP scores of TEALS students are 8-12% above the national average.
* 29% of TEALS students are underrepresented minorities.
 
The TEALS time commitment is several hours a week, and offers a unique opportunity to give back and make a difference in the lives of hundreds of students by working with teachers, all while keeping your day job. <%= cta %> Please visit [http://c.tealsk12.org/l/667](http://c.tealsk12.org/l/667) to learn more and apply to volunteer!
