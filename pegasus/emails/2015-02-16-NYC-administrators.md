We want you to know that Code.org has partnered with NYC Department of Edcuation to bring computer science to your school, at all levels — kindergarten through high school.

Please, share these opportunity with teachers in your district. 

### Why computer science?
It opens more doors for students than any other discipline in today’s world. This is a chance to lead your school and give your students a head start.
