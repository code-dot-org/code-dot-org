Hi <%= user_name %>,

Thank you for signing up to volunteer for the Hour of Code! 

**Can you please take this [5 minute survey](<%= survey_url %>) about your volunteer experience to help us improve the Hour of Code?**

Even if you did not get to volunteer, we want to hear from you too so we can make your volunteer experience better next year.

We heard amazing stories from teachers about the way volunteers inspired their students. Because of your passion, we are changing the face of computer science. Over 16,000 volunteers signed up and organizers hosted over 160,000 events worldwide last week.

We couldn't have done it without your support.
