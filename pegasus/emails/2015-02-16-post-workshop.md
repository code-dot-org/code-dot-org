Thank you for attending a Code.org workshop. You were among our first 4,000 attendees, and I hope you’re already introducing your classroom to computer science with Code Studio.

### Help us spread the word

We’ve had superb feedback. The majority of workshop attendees ranked it the best professional development ever!  If you had a good experience, please spread the word. (If you didn’t, reply with feedback. I can’t respond to every note, but we’ll read it.)

Please ask other elementary school teachers to attend a workshop. [Find local workshops](http://code.org/professional-development-workshops)

### How can you help?

- Email a fellow teacher (see sample email)
