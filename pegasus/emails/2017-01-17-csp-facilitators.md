You were one of the first <%= state_s %> educators to use the Code.org Computer Science Principles curriculum. Here's your chance to go a step further and impact even more students—help us train the next generation of <%= state_s %> computer science educators with this exciting, game-changing curriculum! 

This summer, we're training <%= state_s %> educators in our CS Principles curriculum, and we're looking for highly-qualified, flexible, and knowledgeable facilitators who can develop and support this next generation of computer science educators throughout the 2017-18 school year.
