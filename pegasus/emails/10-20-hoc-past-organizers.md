You knew about the [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com) first. Last week, we officially announced the 2015 campaign to the world. Here’s an exciting update: *every* Hour of Code organizer worldwide will receive a gift card to iTunes, Amazon or the Windows Store as a thank you gift — as long as you’re registered.

## Are you in?
Together, we want to reach 100,000 classrooms during December 7-13. 48,000 organizers have signed up. Please, [let us know if you’ll join us](https://hourofcode.com).

#### If you don't sign up, you'll miss out on:

1. Your thank-you gift 
2. Exciting new tutorials, coming in a few weeks
3. Our new volunteer match — we’re recruiting experts in your area who want to help you with your Hour of Code

## Just one hour can empower students to keep learning
Every student today deserves the opportunity to learn foundational 21st-century skills.
