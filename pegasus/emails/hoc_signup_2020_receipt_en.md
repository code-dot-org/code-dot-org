### Thank you for signing up for the Hour of Code!
Your event is now registered. By volunteering to host an Hour of Code, you’re making it possible for more students to
get the chance to learn computer science. While Hour of Code events are held all over the world during the celebration
of Computer Science Education Week, you can choose to organize an Hour of Code any time! 

## Here are some steps to get started:

### 1. Start planning your event
Explore our library of [Hour of Code activities](https://<%= hourofcode %>/learn) and
[review this how-to guide](https://<%= hourofcode %>/how-to) for helpful tips on how to inspire students, 
determine your technology needs, and more. 

### 2. Spread the word and recruit more people
We need your help to inspire volunteers and organizers from across the globe. 
Tell your friends about the #HourOfCode and [use these helpful resources](https://<%= hourofcode %>/promote/resources) 
to promote your event.

You can also help recruit more people from your school and community by 
[sending our sample emails](https://<%= hourofcode %>/promote/resources#sample-emails) to your principal,
 a local group, or even some friends.


### 3. Invite a local volunteer to inspire your students
[Search our volunteer map](https://<%= codedotorg %>/volunteer/local) to find volunteers who can visit your classroom
 or video chat remotely to inspire your students about the breadth of possibilities with computer science.

### 4. Check-out Hour of Code swag
Swag is a great way to get students excited about the Hour of Code and reward them for completing their activity. 
At the Code.org [Amazon store](https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/8557B2A6-EBF2-4C9F-95C5-C3256FBA0220), you can 
[order posters](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07J6T18DH?m=A2ZEA2ORKPFEVK) with inspirational role models, 
Hour of Code kits, fun stickers, and more! But hurry, supplies are limited.

### Encourage kids to continue learning
