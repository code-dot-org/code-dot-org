We need your help.

California is way behind on computer science education. Despite being home to Silicon Valley, a global center for tech innovation, most schools in CA don't teach computer science. 

But that could change. The California legislature is considering a bill that would form an advisory board to focus on K-12 computer science. This board would develop a strategic plan for reaching more students in CA with quality computer science courses—a huge step toward statewide adoption.

Please help California lead in computer science education the way it leads in tech. <strong>Ask your reps to support change and support this bill.</strong>

There are almost 77,000 open computing jobs in California, and these jobs are <strong>growing at 4.3x the state average!</strong> Coding skills are now important to jobs in multiple fields, including art and design. <strong>Every</strong> student should have the opportunity to learn computer science.

<strong>Take action</strong> and help us bring computer science to all!
