3 years ago, we [launched Code.org with a video](https://youtu.be/nKIu9yen5nc), starring people like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg inspiring students to learn computer science. Since then, hundreds of thousands of educators like yourself, along with [100 cities and districts, 18 states, and even 7 entire nations](http://code.org/about/2015) have embraced CS in grades K-12!

Today, the White House added its support to this grassroots movement, announcing a plan to help every student in America’s public schools learn CS, especially girls and underrepresented students of color. This is a big deal. This “[CS for All](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/01/30/computer-science-all)” initiative proposes $4 billion in funding and additional support for training teachers to bring computer science to students. [Watch the president’s full remarks here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sthaV8ddJ4&feature=youtu.be). 

We couldn’t be happier about the [**bipartisan** support for computer science](https://youtu.be/W5QGo_Yb_Pc), and we need your help to show the local support for this movement:

**Take the next step to spread computer science in your school:** If you’ve tried only an Hour of Code, take it further! We offer [computer science curriculum as well as professional learning workshops](http://code.org/educate), free of cost, to help existing teachers integrate computer science at any grade. The courses and workshops get rave reviews from educators, please check them out: http://code.org/teach. 

If there isn’t a workshop in your region, check out the [3rd party options](http://code.org/educate/3rdparty). Or [write a letter](http://code.org/promote/letter) to your school or district, urging them to offer computer science.

On a personal note, it’s been amazing and humbling to start an effort like Code.org, to watch the worldwide community of teachers, parents, and students, uniting to change our education system. Today is a special milestone for all of us in this community effort.

Thank you, thank you, for your support
