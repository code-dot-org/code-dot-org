You’re one of the awesome organizers who signed up for the Hour of Code first. Last week, we officially announced the Hour of Code 2015 to the world. Here are some updates: 

- *Every* organizer worldwide will receive a gift card to iTunes, Amazon or the Windows Store, as a thank-you gift.
- Technical volunteers are signing up to help with Hour of Code events all over. If you asked to be matched with a volunteer when you signed up, we’ll email you soon to tell you how to search for volunteers in your area.
