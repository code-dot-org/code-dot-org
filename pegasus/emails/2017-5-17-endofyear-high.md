Hello teachers!

The days are longer, the sun’s brighter, and students (and teachers) can’t wait to start summer break! 

I want to share an amazing end-of-year stat about our collective movement to spread computer science in schools: 20% of all U.S. students now have accounts on Code.org, and most of them joined this past year! Beyond the U.S., 10% of all the world’s students have coded on Code.org. Thanks to passionate teachers like you, anything is possible.

I hope you can take steps to broaden participation in computer science before your summer break. Some ideas:

### Invite a guest speaker to inspire students

Ten thousand passionate technologists worldwide are eager to share their love of computer science with your students and help them learn more about what a career in tech could look like. [Invite a guest speaker to your classroom today and use our online map](https://code.org/volunteer/local) to find and contact volunteers in your area to visit your classroom or host a webinar for your class.*

### Start preparing for the 2017-18 school year

As you start planning for next school year, we’ve updated our tools for middle and high school classrooms. 

Are your students hoping to move beyond blocks to learn JavaScript? [App Lab](http://code.org/applab) makes it easy for beginners to create their own apps. [Watch the video and play with it over the summer](http://code.org/applab) to see if it’s right for your class. 

Make sure to look at [Code.org’s library of videos](https://code.org/educate/resources/videos) to help you teach your students computer science concepts next year. [Start with How the Internet Works series](https://code.org/educate/resources/videos) - it’s my favorite. Or, get hands-on learning on how encryption, text compression, and other concepts work with our [widget library](https://code.org/educate/csp/widgets).

### Expand computer science offerings in your school
If your high school doesn’t offer [CS Principles](http://code.org/csp) or [AP Computer Science A](https://code.org/educate/curriculum/apcsa), please speak with your principal or the administration. These are the fastest-spreading courses in secondary education, and students of all backgrounds enjoy them. If you want help selling the idea, [use this presentation](https://code.org/files/computer_science_advocacy.pptx). If your school is on board, the links above can help you get started.

Computer science is key to opening so many doors for students in today’s world, and this movement is just getting started, thanks to you! Half a million passionate teachers like you have already [signed up on Code.org](https://code.org/) to make sure students have every opportunity to succeed. Take another step to grow K-12 computer science today!

Congrats on an awesome year and have a great summer!
