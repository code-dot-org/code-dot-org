After a divisive and draining election, I want to write a heartfelt note to you, the 400,000 educators whose dedication and support has made our work at Code.org possible.

The United States is increasingly divided. Whether you’re celebrating victory or despairing in defeat, it has been exhausting. Amidst the escalating rhetoric, I’ve looked for areas of shared hope.  

Americans all want equality of opportunity. It unites us, even when we don’t agree about how to get there. And if there’s one group that’s dedicated to equality of opportunity, it’s educators. 

I want to thank you for the work you do every day. No matter who you voted for, your students are our future. Whether you teach your students to add and subtract, to read, or to code, yours is the most important job in the world. 

I started Code.org because I saw computer science impacting every industry on the planet. I’m forever indebted to you for helping us spread access to opportunity.

My father is my hero and a teacher. He taught me that teachers are a fundamental pillar of stability in times of change. Our children are in your hands. I want to thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for helping build a future where people are more connected, not more divided. 


Hadi
