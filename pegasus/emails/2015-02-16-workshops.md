I’m writing because you joined as a teacher on Code.org’s learning platform, [Code Studio](http://studio.code.org/). 

For teachers in K-5, we offer one-day professional development workshops in 60 US cities to help you integrate computer science in your classroom. 

### Fantastic workshops, all costs covered!
4,000 teachers have participated and most say it’s the best PD they’ve ever attended.

**[Reserve a spot at a workshop near you near you](https://code.org/educate/k5)** (US teachers only)

### What’s in a workshop?
An experienced computer science facilitator will prepare you to teach our courses for grades K-5. You’ll learn:

- The basics of computer science
- How to guide students through our online curriculum
- How to use the teacher dashboard
- “Unplugged” computer science activities<br />
