Hi <%= name_s %>,


You’re receiving this email because you signed up to volunteer in a local classroom for Code.org. [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com), our annual campaign to introduce <em>every</em> student to computer science through one-hour activities, is coming December 5-11! 

**This is our busiest time of year for volunteers.** Many teachers who are unfamiliar with computer science try an Hour of Code in their classrooms, and the difference a volunteer can make is huge! 

We’re thankful for your support during this hectic week. **You may begin to receive requests for help from teachers in your area soon, so be on the lookout for emails.** Please join our [Volunteer Training Webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZWz5XX5PXk) on Wednesday, October 12 @ 12pm PT / 3pm ET for more information on how to inspire students through Hour of Code!

<h3>Check out these awesome testimonials from volunteers in last year’s Hour of Code:</h3>

<em>“The best part of my experience was that the entire class were women and people of color. It bodes well for the future of our industry to have a chance to reach and excite these kids.”</em>

<em>“I LOVED seeing how excited the kids were. Students who didn’t do as well academically were excelling at thinking like a developer. [Hour of Code] gave them a place to feel confident.”</em>

<h3>Here’s what you should expect:</h3>
1. Teachers can now search for volunteers in their area and learn a little more about them; they’ll be able to find you and the information you shared with us on [this worldwide map](https://code.org/volunteer/local).
2. If a teacher would like your help with their Hour of Code, they will contact you through an online form. You will receive an email from me (Tanya at Code.org) sharing the teacher’s message and full contact information.
3. Want more information? Join our [Volunteer Training Webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZWz5XX5PXk) on Wednesday, October 12 @ 12pm PT / 3pm ET.
4. Review [this toolkit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PcrOW44tq_leRIAUWeUDy-gdrLJGIUNBB_feXF8b9w0/edit#heading=h.x1s6hunmhamh) about how to coordinate with the teacher(s), things to do and share with the classroom, and what to expect when you volunteer.

<h3>What if you aren't contacted?</h3>
If you’re in a large city or technical hub, you may not be contacted due to the high number of volunteer signups in your area. If this is the case, instead of waiting to be contacted, I recommend reaching out directly to a school in your area and offering to help them organize an event, or to other organizations such as the [Girl Scouts](http://www.girlscouts.org/en/adults/volunteer.html) and [Boy Scouts](https://beascout.scouting.org/Volunteer.aspx) or [Boys & Girls Club of America](http://greatfutures.org/pages/).

You can also [host your own Hour of Code event](http://hourofcode.com)!

Students are so fortunate to have so many willing volunteers like you to inspire them during their Hour of Code. Thank you for supporting this movement!
