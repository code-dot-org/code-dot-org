If you remember your very first line of code, you know it shaped the rest of your life. 

That’s what the Hour of Code is all about. In the last two years, the movement has shattered stereotypes of what it’s like to code and helped more than 100 million students in 180 countries try computer science for the first time.

### The Hour of Code is coming — and we need 7,368 software engineers
We’re on track for the largest Hour of Code celebration yet, coming December 7-13. This year, we’re excited to match up classrooms with technical volunteers like you who can help students and teachers through their first Hour of Code. 7,368 teachers have already asked for help.

**Please [volunteer for an hour](https://code.org/engineer).** After you sign up, local teachers will be able to contact you for help. Can’t volunteer? [Help spread the word about the Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com/).

### Your experience matters

Most schools still don’t teach computer science. Most students don’t know that it’s about solving big problems and connecting us all closer together. This is a chance to inspire at least one young person in your area.
