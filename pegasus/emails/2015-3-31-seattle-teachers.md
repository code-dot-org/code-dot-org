Dear Seattle-area teacher, 

Code.org has partnered with districts around the Puget Sound to bring computer science to your students, at all levels — kindergarten through high school. Give your students the chance to learn these foundational 21st-century skills.


### Start with high-quality professional development — at no cost to you or your school

Participating teachers consistently call our professional development, "The best professional development I've ever had!"

**For elementary schools:**

- Short curriculum modules that students absolutely love
- 1-day workshops for teachers (plus librarians, tech ed specialists, etc.)<br />
