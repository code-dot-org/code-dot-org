Happy teacher appreciation week! Thanks to your passion, millions of children have tried computer science. But tens of millions remain without access, and [you can help](http://bit.ly/computersciencepetition). 

Last week, I asked 1 million Code.org supporters to [sign your name](http://bit.ly/computersciencepetition) alongside America’s top leaders urging Congress to fund computer science. We’ve shot past 100,000 signatures, **but we can do much much more if we act together.** 

You have given your time to this movement — **please give another 2 minutes to [sign the petition](http://bit.ly/computersciencepetition).** Even ask your colleagues, communities, and parents to join in support: [http://change.org/computerscience](http://bit.ly/computersciencepetition).

We live in divided times, and debates about opportunity, inequality, growth, and security divide our country. ***But on computer science, with your help, Americans can unite.***

Some may debate whether every *child* must learn to code, but we all agree that every student should have the *opportunity* to learn computer science.

Last week the CEOs of America's largest companies joined 29 governors — from both parties — and top K-12 leaders, in an unprecedented union. Despite their differences, our country's leadership is aligned on this issue across the political spectrum, across industries, across schools, and across state lines. Their letter is included below.

Please sign your name in support of this letter, and spread the word: [http://change.org/computerscience](http://bit.ly/computersciencepetition)

This proposal won't succeed without your help. Don’t make me ask again. :-)

For our children, #CSforAll

## Every student in America should have this opportunity
Dear Members of Congress and fellow Americans,

As business leaders, elected officials, educators, and members of the public, we join forces to deliver a bipartisan message about opportunity and the American Dream. Technology is transforming society at an unprecedented rate. Whether it’s smartphones or social networks, self-driving cars or personalized medicine, nothing embodies the American Dream so much as the opportunity to change or even reinvent the world with technology. And participating in this world requires access to computer science in our schools. **We ask you to provide funding for every student in every school to have an** ***opportunity*** **to learn computer science.**

Support for this idea is sweeping our nation. *Ninety percent of parents want their children to have access to computer science education at school, and teachers agree.* They know that technology opens doors. A hundred thousand teachers have taken matters into their own hands and already begun teaching computer science. Over 100 school districts are rolling out courses, from New York to Chicago to Los Angeles, from Miami to Las Vegas. Twenty states have passed policies and are now looking to support professional training for new computer science teachers. Private donors have collectively committed tens of millions of dollars to solving this problem, including [$48 million of new commitments](http://www.csecoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/OpenLetter-PressRelease-FINAL.pdf) announced today by many of the undersigned.

**Despite this groundswell, three-quarters of U.S. schools do not offer meaningful computer science courses.** At a time when every industry in every state is impacted by advances in computer technology, our schools should give all students the opportunity to understand how this technology works, to learn how to be creators, coders, and makers — not just consumers.  Instead, what is increasingly a basic skill is only available to the lucky few, leaving most students behind, particularly students of color and girls.

How is this acceptable? America leads the world in technology. We invented the personal computer, the Internet, e-commerce, social networking, and the smartphone. **This is our chance to position the next generation to participate in the new American Dream.**

Not only does computer science provide every student foundational knowledge, it also leads to the highest-paying, fastest-growing jobs in the U.S. economy. **There are currently over 500,000 open computing jobs, in every sector, from manufacturing to banking, from agriculture to healthcare, but only 50,000 computer science graduates a year.** Whether a student aspires to be a software engineer, or if she just wants a well-rounded education in today’s changing world, access to computer science in school is an economic imperative for our nation to remain competitive. And with the growing threat of cyber warfare, this is even a critical matter of national security. Despite this growing need, targeted federal funding to carry out these efforts in classrooms is virtually non-existent. **This bipartisan issue can be addressed without growing the federal budget.**

We urge you to amplify and accelerate the local efforts in classrooms, unlock opportunity in every state, and give an answer to all the parents and teachers who believe that every student, in every school, should have a chance to learn computer science.

Sincerely,
