Thank you for your interest in Code.org’s Professional Learning Program! We’re excited to let you know that you can now apply for our [Computer Science Discoveries](https://code.org/educate/professional-learning/cs-discoveries-apply) (CS Discoveries) and [Computer Science Principles](https://code.org/educate/professional-learning/cs-principles-apply) (CS Principles) programs. The application period **closes on March 17th**, and we’ll review applications on a rolling basis. 

Code.org’s Professional Learning Program is an intensive year-long program for middle and high school educators who are interested in teaching our computer science courses. These programs give you all the resources and practice you need to provide high quality instruction. You’ll enjoy dedicated time to deliver lessons with your colleagues, dive deep into the curriculum and tools, and experiment with inquiry-based approaches to teaching.

 Teachers who are accepted to the program commit to:

* Attending the five-day, in-person summer workshop (dates and locations assigned by district)
* Attending four local one-day, in-person workshops (normally on Saturdays)
* Engaging in 20 hours of online professional development
* Teaching the course during the 2017-18 school year
* Supporting the recruitment and enrollment of a diverse group of students in the course, representative of the school's overall student population

You’ll also go through the program with a cohort of teachers from all kinds of backgrounds. You’ll learn from each other, make computer science allies, and become part of a huge movement that’s changing the face of education in the US and opening doors for students everywhere.
