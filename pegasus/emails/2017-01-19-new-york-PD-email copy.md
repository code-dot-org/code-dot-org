Dear Teachers, 

Code/Interactive is thrilled to announce that applications for Code.org's Professional Learning Program for AP CS Principles (grades 9-12) and CS Discoveries (grades 7-9) are now open! As Code.org's exclusive Regional Partner, Code/Interactive is the only local training provider for these courses.

Your students are already glued to computers, games, and apps. And we all know technology will shape everything about their futures.

If you want to increase your skills in teaching how tech works and how to take part in building it, you can widen your computer science course offerings with fantastic curriculum and professional learning for teachers of all backgrounds. No prior experience with computer science is required and it’s at no cost to you or your school.

Apply now or forward this opportunity to other interested teachers or administrators.

<h2>AP Computer Science Principles</h2>

In fall 2016, the College Board launched its newest AP® course, AP Computer Science Principles. The course introduces students to the foundational concepts of computer science and challenges them to explore how computing and technology can impact the world. The goal of AP Computer Science Principles is to create leaders in computer science fields and attract and engage those who are traditionally underrepresented with essential computing tools and multidisciplinary opportunities. 

If you’re a NYC DOE teacher, you’ve got two great curriculum options:

**Every NYC DOE Teacher that participated last year said they would recommend this PD to others:**

*"This is my 18th year of teaching and CSP is the best curriculum I have ever implemented.”*

*“It was absolutely rich and the most meaningful training I have ever attended in 16 years of teaching."*
