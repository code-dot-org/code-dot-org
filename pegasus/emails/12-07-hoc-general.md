### A worldwide movement
<% if international == true %>
In the USA, Brooklyn and Chicago are going head-to-head in a competition to reach more students. In Nigeria and Syria, students are coding amidst the violence. In Russia and Italy, the Ministry of Education asked every school to host an Hour of Code. In Zimbabwe, Guam, Colombia, Canada, Fiji, France, Malta, Afghanistan — in ***every*** country — students are learning skills that can change the rest of their lives.

### Beyond one hour — a sea-change in education
Thanks to your voices, the largest U.S. cities have adopted computer science. Some entire states are adding the course to schools. But 75% of schools still don’t teach this foundational field. You can help change that. Ask your local school to teach computer science ([sample letter](https://code.org/promote/letter)).
