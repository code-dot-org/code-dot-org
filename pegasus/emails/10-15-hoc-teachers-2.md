## The Hour of Code is coming, December 7-13, 2015!

Thanks to educators like you, the [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com/) keeps changing the world. This year can be a turning point for computer science in our schools, with new tutorials, new prizes, and you.

#### Together, we want to reach 100,000 classrooms worldwide

I hope you’ll join us to prove anybody can learn, and every young person deserves to learn how to build technology that will impact everything in their future.
