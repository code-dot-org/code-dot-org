Dear educator,

Code.org has partnered with districts around Southern California to bring computer science to your students, at all K-12 levels.

You *don’t* need any prior exposure to computer science to participate. If you’re curious about technology and want the skills to teach computer science to your students, you’ll get everything you need with high-quality professional learning — at no cost to you or your school. 

### Elementary school teachers: 

- Teach fun, short courses that students love
- 1-day workshops prepare you to start teaching right away
- Open to K-5 educators **in any district** (including librarians, tech ed specialists, etc.)

### High school teachers:

- Teach year-long computer science courses that are approachable, collaborative, and relate to everyday life

### Computer science is a foundation for success in any future career

This is a chance to lead your school and give your students a head start.
