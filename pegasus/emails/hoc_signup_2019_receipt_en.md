### Thanks for signing up to host an Hour of Code!
Thank you for helping make it possible for students to start learning computer science! Computer Science Education Week and the Hour of Code run from December 9-15, and we couldn't be more excited.

In the meantime, what can you do now?

### 1. Find a local volunteer to help you with your event.
[Search our volunteer map](https://<%= codedotorg %>/volunteer/local) to find volunteers who can visit your classroom or video chat remotely to inspire your students about the breadth of possibilities with computer science.

### 2. Spread the word & recruit your whole school
We need your help to reach organizers worldwide. Tell your friends about the #HourOfCode. [Use these helpful resources](https://<%= hourofcode %>/promote/resources) to promote your event.

Help recruit more people from your school and community by [sending our sample emails](https://<%= hourofcode %>/promote/resources#sample-emails) to your principal, a local group, or even some friends.
