I'm writing to let you know that Code.org is preparing NYC teachers to offer computer science, at all levels — kindergarten through high school. 

### Get started with high-quality professional development — at no cost to you or your school

Participating teachers consistently call our professional development, "The best professional development I've ever had!"

**Elementary school teachers:**

- Open to all K-5 teachers (plus librarians, tech ed specialists, etc.)
- 1-day workshops allow you to start teaching right away, at your own pace<br />

**Middle & high school teachers:**

- Research-based professional development open to all NYC DOE high school and middle school *science* teachers
- Per-session stipends to teachers are paid by Code.org!<br />

### Why computer science?

It opens more doors for students than any other discipline in today’s world. This is a chance to lead your school and give your students a head start.
