### Double your impact: ask one other teacher to join
We’re on track to top last year’s Hour of Code to make this the largest learning event in history! But to reach our goal of 100,000 classrooms, we need your help! Please, ask one other teacher in your school to host an Hour of Code next week.

**Here’s what you need to know now to make your Hour of Code a success:**

### 1) Choose from final tutorials
Every Hour of Code tutorial [is now ready](https://code.org/learn). We’ve been adding more options and improving what's available every day.

### 2) Use friendly urls
When you’re ready to start your Hour of Code, write an easy, “friendly url” on the board. [Each tutorial](https://code.org/learn) has a short link. Instruct students to type it into their browsers to get started.

### 4) Watch inspiring video chats – celebrate computer science all week
Throughout the next week, Sheryl Sandberg, Bill Gates, Ashton Kutcher and more, will chat with classrooms around the country. [Tune into the live chats, or watch the video archives](http://hourofcode.com/us/prizes#video_chat).
