If you did the Hour of Code last year with your class, you might have used our Minecraft tutorial. Since launching, it’s been used over 31 million times by students—thank you for making this fun and exciting introduction to computer science so popular!

For 2016, Code.org, Microsoft and Mojang are announcing the all-new **[Minecraft Hour of Code Designer](http://code.org/minecraft)**, a tutorial that lets students code their own Minecraft rules. This year, students can use code to control how animals and other Minecraft creatures behave—they can create a totally unique Minecraft experience, and then share it with friends or play it on their phones!

The new tutorial begins in a Minecraft world where sheep don't move, the chickens don't cluck, and nothing attacks: it’s a blank slate without movement or defined action. Over the course of an hour, students will bring this world to life using computer science. At the final level, they get to define the rules of Minecraft however they wish. If they want, the cows can lay eggs, sheep can explode, and zombies can run away from players!

If you used last year’s Minecraft activity, the new one provides a perfect way to expand your students’ knowledge of computer science. For new teachers, we are pleased to offer both tutorials, which require *no experience* to teach.

We’re thrilled to add **[Minecraft Hour of Code Designer](http://code.org/minecraft)** to our list of activities for this year’s Hour of Code. If you haven’t checked out the expanded list yet, there are tons of new activities that you can filter on our site based on grade level, experience level, subject area, and more. Find the perfect activity for your class at [https://code.org/learn](https://code.org/learn).

Computer Science Education Week (December 5-11, 2016) is almost here! [Sign up your Hour of Code event here](http://hourofcode.com/#join) if you haven't yet and get ready to do the new Minecraft tutorial with your class!
