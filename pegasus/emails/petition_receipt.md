## 3) Ask your local school to [teach computer science](https://code.org/educate)

Here's a [sample letter](https://code.org/promote/letter) to send to your school! Your local school can teach these [intro courses](https://studio.code.org), partner with us to bring computer science [to your entire district or region](https://code.org/educate/partner), and inspire students with [these videos](https://code.org/educate/inspire). Check [our map](https://code.org/learn/local) to see if your school teaches computer science. If not, ask them to.

## 4) Support our work

[Make a generous donation](https://code.org/donate) or [buy a t-shirt or hat](https://store.code.org). We're working to give every student the opportunity to learn computer science. One child learns for every dollar you donate.

## 5) Not in the United States? Sign up to receive updates about Code.org's International Program

Code.org partners with dozens of organizations around the world to promote computer science education. [Get the latest news](http://go.pardot.com/l/153401/2018-07-20/lfw71d) about newsletters, webinars, and updates specifically for Code.org's international community. 

In just a few years, support for computer science has impacted hundreds of thousands of classrooms and tens of millions of students. Many school districts, U.S. states, and even entire countries have joined the movement. 

I won't email this list too often. Please follow our progress [on Facebook](https://facebook.com/Code.org) or [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/codeorg) to stay in touch.
