## 5) Support our work

[Make a generous donation](https://code.org/donate) or [buy a t-shirt or hat](https://store.code.org). We're working to give every student the opportunity to learn computer science. One child learns for every dollar you donate.

In just a few years, support for computer science has impacted hundreds of thousands of classrooms and tens of millions of students. Many school districts, U.S. states, and even entire countries have joined the movement. 

I won't email this list too often. Please follow our progress [on Facebook](https://facebook.com/Code.org) or [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/codeorg) to stay in touch.
