## 2) Teach computer science

You can teach these self-serve [intro courses](https://studio.code.org), with professional development included, inspire students with [these videos](https://code.org/educate/inspire), or partner with us to bring computer science [to your entire district](https://code.org/educate/districts).

## 2) Ask your local school to [teach computer science](https://code.org/educate)

Here's a [sample letter](https://code.org/promote/letter) you can send. Your local school can teach these [intro courses](https://studio.code.org), partner with us to bring computer science [to your entire district](https://code.org/educate/districts), and inspire students with [these videos](https://code.org/educate/inspire). Check [our map](https://code.org/learn/local) to see if your school teaches computer science. If not, ask them to.

## 3) [Host an Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com) — at work, in your community, or local school

Help students worldwide learn their first Hour of Code, to show that anyone can learn the basics. [Get involved](https://hourofcode.com) or [try it yourself](https://code.org/learn). If you're technical, [volunteer to help a teacher in your community](https://code.org/volunteer).

## 4) Support our work

[Make a generous donation](https://code.org/donate) or [buy a t-shirt or hat](https://store.code.org). We're working to give every student the opportunity to learn computer science. One child learns for every dollar you donate.

In just a few years, support for computer science has impacted hundreds of thousands of classrooms and tens of millions of students. The largest school districts, U.S. states, and even entire countries have joined the movement. 

I won't email this list too often. Please follow our progress [on Facebook](https://facebook.com/Code.org) or [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/codeorg) to stay in touch.
