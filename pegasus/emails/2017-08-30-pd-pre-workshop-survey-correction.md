Hi <%= teacher_name %>,

We made a mistake! 

The previous workshop reminder you received had the wrong link to your pre-workshop survey. 
Please use this [link](<%= pre_workshop_survey_url %>) to complete your two-question survey today. 
Your input will help your facilitators prepare for their time with you at your upcoming workshop.

Thank you,  
<%= organizer_name %>
