Hi <%= form[:data]['first_name_s'] %>,

Thank you for submitting your TeacherCon registration form! If you responded that you plan to 
join the Professional Learning Program, we look forward to meeting you this summer! You will 
receive more information about travel approximately six weeks before TeacherCon. In the 
meantime, please visit [code.org/educate/resources/recruit](code.org/educate/resources/recruit) 
for resources and ideas to help you recruit students for your course.

If you responded that you are not able to join the program this year, please feel free to 
access all of our curricula and materials at code.org/educate. We hope that you’ll consider 
applying again in 2018.

Please contact [teacher@code.org](mailto:teacher@code.org) with any questions. 

Thank you,
Sarah Fairweather
Teacher Development Program Manager
