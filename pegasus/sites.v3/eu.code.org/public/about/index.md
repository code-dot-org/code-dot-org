# About Us

The European Coding Initiative brings together a wide array of stakeholders to promote coding and computational thinking at all levels of education, as well as in more informal settings. The project was created in June 2014 under the auspices of the European Commission, and is supported by partners from the technology industry, including Microsoft, SAP, Rovio, Liberty Global and Facebook. The initiative also involves not-for-profit organisations involved in the promotion of coding and computer science education, including Code.org, CoderDojo and European Schoolnet.

<br />

The aim of the campaign is to promote coding through a mixture of online and offline, real-life activities, with a view to establishing coding as a key competence within every education system in Europe. The eu.code.org website, developed in conjunction with Code.org, will provide resources in a number of languages, catering to everyone from the youngest coders, to pedagogical resources and lesson plans for teachers, to industry training and certification for professionals. The European Coding Initiative will play a central role in a number of Europe-wide advocacy and awareness-raising campaigns, including EU Code Week, Computer Science Week, and the European activities of the Hour of Code campaign. 

<br />

If you are a technology company, and want to get involved in training the coders of tomorrow, or an association active in the field looking to get involved in a global campaign, get in touch today.
