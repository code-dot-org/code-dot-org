%h2 What is a CoderDojo? 
CoderDojo is the world's largest community of independent, free, programming clubs for young people. Clubs (Dojos) run all over the world on a weekly/bi-weekly basis, giving young people between the ages of 7 and 17 the opportunity to learn how to develop computer code, websites, apps, programs, games, and to explore and create with technology. In addition to hard technology skills, young people experience a fun, collaborative, high energy learning environment, while building complementary soft skills of creativity, innovation, communication, collaboration, teamwork and leadership. To date there are 500+ Dojos spread across 48 countries, impacting thousands of children on a weekly basis.
