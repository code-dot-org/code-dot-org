# Teach the Hour of Code in your classroom

Hour of Code is an opportunity for every student to try computer science for one hour.

You can also teach the Hour of Code all year-round. Tutorials will work on browsers, tablets, smartphones, or "unplugged."

## Watch this how-to video:

## Prep for the Hour of Code:

**Choose a tutorial for your students**

- Check out the [tutorials](/students) and pick one for your class. 
- Go through the tutorial yourself so you can help students during the Hour of Code.
- Test tutorials on student computers or devices. Make sure they work properly (with sound and video).
- Preview the congrats page to see what students will see when they finish. 
- If the tutorial you choose works best with sound, provide headphones for your class, or ask students to bring their own.

**Plan ahead based on your technology available**

- Don't have enough devices? Use [pair programming](http://www.ncwit.org/resources/pair-programming-box-power-collaborative-learning). When students partner up, they help each other and rely less on the teacher. They’ll also see that computer science is social and collaborative.
- Have low bandwidth? Plan to show videos at the front of the class, so each student isn't downloading their own videos.

## During your Hour of Code

**Inspire your students - show them a video**

Check out [these videos](http://youtube.com/codeorg), featuring Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Black Eyed Peas founder will.i.am and NBA star Chris Bosh talking about the importance of programming.
(There are [1 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYZF6oIZtfc), [5 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc), and [9 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1xS07N-FA) versions)

**Get your students excited - give them a short intro**

Most kids don’t know what computer science is. Here are some ideas:

- Explain it in a simple way that includes examples of applications that both boys and girls will care about (saving lives, helping people, connecting people, etc.).
- Try: "Think about things in your everyday life that use computer science: a cell phone, a microwave, a computer, a traffic light… all of these things needed a computer scientist to help build them.”
- Or: “Computer science is the art of blending human ideas and digital tools to increase our power. Computer scientists work in so many different areas: writing apps for phones, curing diseases, creating animated movies, working on social media, building robots that explore other planets and so much more."

## Start your Hour of Code

**Direct students to the activity**

- Write the tutorial link on a whiteboard. 
- Tell students to visit the URL and start the tutorial.

**When your students come across difficulties**

- Tell students, “Ask 3 then me.” Ask 3 classmates, and if they don’t have the answer, then ask the teacher.
- Encourage students and offer positive reinforcement: “You’re doing great, so keep trying.”
- It’s okay to respond: “I don’t know. Let’s figure this out together.” If you can’t figure out a problem, use it as a good learning lesson for the class: “Technology doesn’t always work out the way we want. Together, we’re a community of learners.” And: “Learning to program is like learning a new language; you won’t be fluent right away.“
 

**What to do if a student finishes early?**

- Students can try more [tutorials](/students/beyond)
- Or, ask students who finish early to help classmates who are having trouble with the activity.
