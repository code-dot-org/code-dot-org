  hoc_faq_account_a: "Jo. Absolutisht nuk nevojitet Regjistrim apo Login për nxënësit për të provuar Orën e Kodimit. Shumica e <a href='http://%{codeorg_url}/learn/beyond'>kurseve</a> kërkojnë krijimin e një llogarie për të ruajtur të dhënat që dëshmojnë progresin e studentit."

  hoc_faq_one_hour_a: 'Qëllimi i orës së Kodimit nuk është të mësojë dikë të bëhet një ekspert në shkenca kompjuterike për një orë. Një orë është mjaftueshëm për të mësuar që shkencat kompjuterike janë argëtuese dhe kreative, të aksesueshme nga të gjitha moshat, të gjithë studentët, pavarësisht nivelit të njohurive të tyre. Matja e suksesit të kësaj fushate nuk bëhet duke parë se sa mësojnë studentë CS -suksesi reflektohet në pjesëmarrjen e gjerë të të gjitha gjinive, grupeve etnike dhe social-ekonomike, dhe rritja rezulton në rregjistrimin dhe pjesëmarrjen në të gjitha kurset CS të të gjitha niveleve. Miliona mësues dhe studentë pjesmarrës kanë vendosur të shkojnë përtej një ore -për të mësuar një ditë, një javë apo edhe më gjatë, dhe shumë studentë kanë vendosur të rregjistrohen në një kurs të tërë(ose edhe një kolegj) si rezultat i kësaj.<br/><br/> Përveç studentëve një tjetër "nxënës" është edukatori që fiton besimin pas një ore që ata mund të shpjegojnë shkencat kompjuterike edhe pse ata nuk kanë një diplomë si inxhinierë informatike. Dhjetëra mijëra  mësues vendosin të ndjekin më tej shkencat kompjuterike, të marrin një PD ose të ofrojnë kurse që ndiqen online, ose të dyja. Dhe kjo vlen gjithashtu edhe për administratorët e shkollave, të cilët kuptojnë që shkencat kompjuterike janë diçka që studentët e tyre duan dhe që mësuesit janë të aftë të shpjegojnë.<br/><br/> Mbi të gjitha, ajo çka të gjithë pjesëmarrësit mund të mësojnë në një orë është që ne mund ta bëjmë këtë.'
