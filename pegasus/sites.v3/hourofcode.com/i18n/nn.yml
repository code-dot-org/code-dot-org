  oceans_behind_the_scenes_1: Levels 2-4 use a pretrained model provided by the <a
    href="https://www.tensorflow.org/" >TensorFlow</a> <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/slim/nets/mobilenet_v1.md">
    MobileNet </a> project. A MobileNet model is a <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/practica/image-classification/convolutional-neural-networks">convolutional
    neural network</a> that has been trained on <a href="http://www.image-net.org/">ImageNet</a>,
    a dataset of over 14 million images hand-annotated with words such as "balloon"
    or "strawberry". In order to customize this model with the labeled training data
    the student generates in this activity, we use a technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning">Transfer
    Learning</a>. Each image in the training dataset is fed to MobileNet, as pixels,
    to obtain a list of annotations that are most likely to apply to it. Then, for
    a new image, we feed it to MobileNet and compare its resulting list of annotations
    to those from the training dataset. We classify the new image with the same label
    (such as "fish" or "not fish") as the images from the training set with the most
    similar results.

    14 million images hand-annotated with words such as "balloon" or "strawberry".

  oceans_behind_the_scenes_2: Levels 6-8 use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine">Support-Vector
    Machine</a> (SVM). We look at each component of the fish (such as eyes, mouth,
    body) and assemble all of the metadata for the components (such as number of teeth,
    body shape) into a vector of numbers for each fish. We use these vectors to train
    the SVM. Based on the training data, the SVM separates the "space" of all possible
    fish into two parts, which correspond to the classes we are trying to learn (such
    as "blue" or "not blue").

  tenth_anniversary_testimonials_01: I had a high school student come up to me four
    years after I had her as an 8th grade middle schooler and she was excited that
    she was going to study computer science in college. As a middle schooler she was
    exposed to something new, and that planted a seed for her college years.
  tenth_anniversary_testimonials_02: I joined Hour of Code in your inaugural year
    and have been with you all the way! It has inspired me to seek out additional
    coding opportunities for my students. Thanks for all you have done to get kids
    engaged and excited about computer science! We wouldn't be where we are without
    you!
  tenth_anniversary_testimonials_03: I owe Code.org so much. I'm the teacher I am
    today because of the tools you provide for educators like me. I've been using
    Code.org since 2013 and I've been a facilitator since 2019. Thanks for making

  farsi_page_top_heading: Code.org in Farsi
  farsi_page_top_heading_02: Talent is everywhere, but opportunity is not. Code.org
    in Farsi opens a door to an opportunity that would otherwise be closed.
  farsi_page_top_desc: Today, there are over 110 million Farsi speakers worldwide.
    While the majority of native speakers live in Iran, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan,
    there are millions living as immigrants, migrants, and refugees around the world.
    With the Code.org in Farsi initiative, Farsi-speaking students will have the same
    access to our curricula that is already available to students in all other major
    languages of the world.
  farsi_page_global_heading: The Global Impact of Iranians in Education & Technology
  farsi_page_global_desc_01: When you think of an algorithm, you may assume it's something
    new, but the concept of an algorithm was discovered in Iran over 1300 years ago.
    “Algorithm” is named after its inventor, the mathematician Al Khwarizmi, who lived
    in the land formerly known as Persia and now known as Iran. Once the epicenter
    of mathematics, science, philosophy, and medicine, Iran has made profound advances
    and impacts in technology.
  farsi_page_global_desc_02: Beyond the borders of the country itself, Iranians around
    the world have contributed in countless ways to science and technology — as co-founders
    or CEOs of technology companies such as Uber, eBay, Intuit, and Dropbox, or inventing
    technologies such as LASIK surgery or JPEG compression, or in scientific, academic,
    or engineering roles around the globe.

    and has grown to become one of the largest education nonprofits globally.

    student in every school has the opportunity to learn computer science.
  farsi_page_founders_heading: Our Founders' Story
  farsi_page_founders_slide_01: Born in Iran, Hadi and Ali Partovi grew up during
    the Iran-Iraq war. Their neighborhood in Tehran was bombed by Iraqi fighter jets.
  farsi_page_founders_slide_02: When they were 9 years old, their father, a physics
    professor, brought home a Commodore 64 computer from a trip abroad. This computer
    was their escape from their surroundings – they learned how to code and create
    apps, games, and music.
  farsi_page_founders_slide_03: They immigrated to the United States at age 11. Soon
    after they turned 15, they spent their summers working as software engineers to
    help pay their way through high school and college.
  farsi_page_founders_slide_04: Upon graduating from Harvard University with Masters
    degrees in computer science, Hadi and Ali pursued careers in technology.
  farsi_page_founders_slide_05: They attained success in the technology industry and
    founded numerous tech businesses, accomplishing the American dream. Additionally,
    they became prolific angel investors, backing companies such as Facebook, Uber,
    Airbnb, and Dropbox, among others.
  farsi_page_founders_slide_06: In 2013, Hadi and Ali launched the education nonprofit
    Code.org, which Hadi continues to lead as CEO. Since its inception, Code.org has
    started a massive movement to teach computer science and coding to K-12 students
    globally. It is also the largest provider of computer  science curricula in the
    world, with over 80 million student users in 180 countries.
  farsi_page_support_heading: Your Support and Your Voice
  farsi_page_support_heading_02: Thank you for your interest in Code.org in Farsi.

    specific project and get updated on its staged release dates."
  farsi_page_support_contact_us: If you'd like to support this initiative or learn
    more, please [contact us](%{contact_link}) or donate below.
  farsi_page_compliance_heading: Compliance In Support Of Farsi Translations
  farsi_page_compliance_desc: As a U.S. nonprofit, Code.org is subject to laws regarding
    sanctions with Iran. After consulting with U.S. legal counsel experienced in the
    Iranian Sanctions and Translations Regulations (ITSR), Code.org believes that
    it may fund, prepare, and distribute the Farsi Translations of CS Curriculum in
    the United States and elsewhere around the world, including within Iran. The ITSR
    provides an exemption for “information and informational materials” (the IIM Exemption)
    and Code.org believes that this exemption will fully shield its funding, preparation,
    and distribution of the Farsi Translations and thus enable its Farsi Translations
    effort to proceed in full compliance with U.S. economic sanctions requirements.

    your contact information to a Regional Partner in your area](%{regional_partner_url}).
  csp_page_faq_question_04: What is the recommended timing for teaching CS Principles?
  csp_page_faq_answer_04_01: We recommend that CS Principles be taught as a full year
    class, assuming that you meet with students daily or nearly daily for 45 or more
    minutes.
  csp_page_faq_answer_04_02: It is possible to teach CS Principles on a semester block
    schedule, though we highly recommend this implementation only be used in the fall
    semester. Since the AP Performance Tasks are due in late April and require 20
    dedicated hours of class time to complete, most schools find there is not enough
    time to complete the course on a block schedule in the spring.
  csp_page_faq_question_05: What materials do I need for CS Principles?
  csp_page_faq_answer_05_01: CS Principles requires that students have access to computers
    with a modern web browser. At this time, our courses are not optimized for tablets
    or mobile devices. For more details, [check out Code.org's technology requirements](%{it_url}).
  csp_page_faq_answer_05_02: 'Many lessons have handouts that are designed to guide
    students through activities. While these handouts are not required, we highly
    recommend their use. In addition to handouts, several lessons call for specific

  csp_page_faq_answer_05_03_list_03: Markers
  csp_page_faq_answer_05_03_list_04: Post-it notes
  csp_page_faq_question_06: How can I access answer keys?
  csp_page_faq_answer_06_01: With an approved teacher account, you can find answer
    keys in a blue "Teacher Only" panel that shows in the online lessons and activities.
  csp_page_faq_answer_06_02: Teachers in our Professional Learning Program will automatically

  csp_page_faq_question_07: How was the curriculum developed?
  csp_page_faq_answer_07_01: Our CS Principles curriculum has always been designed
    as part of a broader vision of supporting high quality, engaging, and equitable
    computer science instruction in classrooms across the country. Our [Curriculum
    Values](%{curriculum_url}) continue to guide us, and in particular our focus on
    expanding access to those who historically have been denied opportunities to learn
    about the exciting and impactful field of computing. While our vision and values
    remain unchanged, the landscape of CS education is rapidly developing.
  csp_page_faq_answer_07_02: For the 2020-21 school year the College Board has made
    some significant updates to the CS Principles framework and AP assessment to ensure
    that CS Principles remains relevant and aligned with equivalent university courses.
    CS education research continues to reveal new insights on how students learn about
    computing, and feedback from the thousands of classrooms now using our CS Principles
    curriculum has identified opportunities to further improve our courses, tools,
    and recommended pedagogy.
  csp_page_faq_answer_07_03: The goal of the updates to our curriculum is to navigate
    these developments in a way that remains committed to our vision and values and
    supports the many teachers, schools, classrooms, and districts that are already
    a part of our broader CS Principles community. We remain deeply thankful for you
    joining us on this mission to make our collective vision a reality.

    lesson in CS Discoveries contains mappings to the relevant 2017 CSTA standards.
    [A summary of standards mappings can be found here](%{mappings_url}). A Google
    Sheets version of the standards can be found at [CSD Standards](%{csd_standards_url}).
  csd_page_faq_question_02: How/Where can I get professional development for this

  csd_page_faq_answer_02: Our Professional Learning Program offers year-round support.
    The program kicks off with a five-day summer workshop where you'll have an opportunity
    to work hands-on with the curriculum and meet other teachers from your area. Throughout
    the year, we offer follow up workshops and forum support. You don't need any prior
    computer science experience to get started. And teachers love it! 90% rank it
    the best professional development ever. [Click here to apply and learn more](%{apply_url}).
  csd_page_faq_question_03: I'm teaching CS Discoveries but have less than one semester
    with my students. What would you recommend?
  csd_page_faq_answer_03_01: Teachers who have a restricted schedule, unable to teach
    all units of CS Discoveries over the course of a school year, can now easily assign
    a specific set of CS Discoveries units based on what they want to focus on. These
    collections are still the same exact units found in CS Discoveries, simply grouped
    together based on our recommendations below to dive deep in a specific area of
    CS Discoveries. Each collection is approximately one semester or slightly less
    than one semester. [Click here to see our Collections options](%{collections_url}).
  csd_page_faq_answer_03_02: For teachers who have an even more restricted schedule,
    they have the ability to assign just one unit at a time from CS Discoveries without
    assigning the entire course. We hope this helps support classrooms that teach
    units of CS Discoveries embedded as part of larger courses or when teaching computer
    science on a limited schedule. [Click here to see our flexible units](%).
  csd_page_faq_question_04: What materials and supplies are required for CS Discoveries?
  csd_page_faq_answer_04_01: One potential cost to consider when teaching this course
    is printing. Many lessons have handouts that are designed to guide students through
    activities. While it is not required that all of these handouts be printed, many
    were designed to be printed and we highly recommend printing when possible.
  csd_page_faq_answer_04_02: 'Beyond printing, some lessons call for typical classroom
    supplies and manipulatives such as: Student journals, poster paper, markers/colored
    pencils, scissors, scrap paper, glue or tape, post-it notes or index cards (or
    similar sized scrap paper), and rulers or a straight edge of some kind.'
  csd_page_faq_answer_04_03: 'In addition to those general course materials, the following
    items are called for in specific units:'
  csd_page_faq_answer_04_04: Problem Solving and Computing
  csd_page_faq_answer_04_05: Aluminum foil, container for water, pennies (note that
    pennies can be replaced with some other kind of weight of the same size). Alternate
    activities are available if you do not have access to these supplies.
  csd_page_faq_answer_04_06: Creating Apps with Devices (Option A and Option B)
  csd_page_faq_answer_04_07: 'Option A: Classroom set of Circuit Playgrounds. Check
    out [code.org/maker/circuitplayground](%{url}) for more details.'
  csd_page_faq_answer_04_08: 'Option B: Classroom set of micro:bit devices. Check
    out [code.org/maker/microbit](%{url}) for more details.'
  csd_page_faq_answer_04_09: Maker supplies, such as empty tissue boxes or cardboard
    rolls or scratch paper
  csd_page_faq_answer_04_10: "*Note: The Creating Apps with Devices unit has two implementation
    options - one for those using circuit playgrounds and one for those using micro:bit.
    Teachers should not buy both sets of devices or teach both unit options as they
    are equivalent and cover the same content."
  csd_page_faq_question_06: How does CS Discoveries fit with the other Code.org courses?
  csd_page_faq_answer_06_01: CS Discoveries is designed to fit naturally between our
    [CS Fundamentals](%{csf_url}) courses and our [CS Principles](%{csp_url}) course.
    While each of these courses is designed to be an age-appropriate entry point to
    computer science, students with previous experience will find many new topics
    to explore, and they will revisit familiar topics in novel and more challenging
    contexts.

    Kodetimen starta som ein timeslang introduksjon til datavitskap, designa for å avmystifisere koding og vise at alle kan lære det grunnleggande og for å auka deltaking innan dataprogrammering.
     Det har sidan blitt ein verdsomfattande innsatsi å feire dataprogrammering, som starta som aktivitetar på ein time, men som har utvida seg til all slags engasjement i samfunnet. Sjekk ut <a href='%{tutorials}'>øvingar og aktivitetar</a>. Denne grasrotkampanjen er støtta av over <a href='%{partners}'>400 partnarar</a> og 200.000 lærarar og pedagogar over heile verda.
  hoc_faq_what_is_hoc_a_markdown: The Hour of Code started as a one-hour introduction
    to computer science, designed to demystify "code", to show that anybody can learn
    the basics, and to broaden participation in the field of computer science. It
    has since become a worldwide effort to celebrate computer science, starting with
    1-hour coding activities but expanding to all sorts of community efforts. Check

    No. We have Hour of Code tutorials that work on PCs, smartphones, tablets, and some that require no computer at all! You can join wherever you are, with whatever you have.

    _Here are a few options:_

    - **Work in pairs.** [Research shows](%{pair_programming_research}) students learn best with [pair programming](%{pair_programming_video}), sharing a computer and working together. Encourage your students to double up.
    - **Use a projected screen.** If you have a projector and screen for a Web-connected computer, your entire group can do an Hour of Code together. Watch video portions together and take turns solving puzzles or answering questions.
    - **Go unplugged.** We offer [tutorials that require no computer](%{unplugged_url}) at all.
  hoc_faq_international_q: Eg er i <country>. Korleis kan eg delta internasjonalt?
  hoc_faq_international_a: Kven som helst kan organisere eit Kodetime-arrangement,

  hoc_faq_tutorial_q: Korleis kan eg lage ei veiledning for Kodetimen?
  hoc_faq_tutorial_a: Om du er interessert i å bli ein rettleiingsspartner, <a href='target-tutorial-guidelines'>sjå
    våre retningslinjer og instruksjonar</a>. Vi ynskjer å skape mange ulike mogelegheiter,
    men primærmålet er å optimalisere erfaringa for elevane og lærarane som er nye
    innan datavitskap.
  hoc_faq_tutorial_a_markdown: If you're interested in becoming a tutorial partner,
    [see our guidelines and instructions](%{tutorial_guidelines}). We'd like to host
    a variety of engaging options, but the primary goal is to optimize the experience
    for students and teachers who are new to computer science.
  hoc_faq_account_q: Må elevane logge på med ein konto?
  hoc_faq_account_a: Nei. Registrering eller innlogging er ikkje naudsynt for at elevar
    skal prøve Kodetimen. Dei fleste <a href='%{codeorg_url}/learn/beyond'>kursa for
    viderekommande</a> krev ein konto for å kunne lagre framgangen til eleven. Når
    du registrerer deg for Kodetimen lagar IKKJE automatisk ein Code Studio-konto.
    Dersom du ønsker å lage kontoar for elevande dine, følg desse <a href='https://youtu.be/_smelV_KISE'>instruksjonane</a>.
  hoc_faq_account_a_markdown: No. Absolutely no signup or login is required for students
    to try the Hour of Code. Most of the [follow-on courses](%{codeorg_url}/learn/beyond)
    require account creation to save student progress. Also, signing up for the Hour
    of Code does NOT automatically create a Code Studio account. If you do want to
    create accounts for your students, please follow these [instructions](%{section_instructions_url}).
  hoc_faq_high_school_q: Kva for aktivitet bør eg gjere med elevar i vidaregåande
    skule?
  hoc_faq_high_school_a: Oppgåvene på Star Wars og Minecraft er bra for vidaregåande,
    særleg Star Wars JavaScript-versjonen og gratisnivået i begge oppgåvene. Alternativt
    tilrår vi å starte med nybyrbegynneroppgåvene på <a href='%{codeorg_url}/learn'>%{partner_url}/learn</a>
    for å starte, til dømes oppgåva med Angry Birds eller med Anna og Elsa frå Frost.
    Ein elev i vidaregåande skule bør klare desse på 30 minutt og kan gå vidare til
    ei meir avansert oppgåve i JavaScript, frå for eksempel Khan Academy eller CodeHS.
  hoc_faq_high_school_a_markdown: Our Star Wars and Minecraft tutorials are great
    for high schoolers, especially the Star Wars JavaScript version and the free play
    level on both tutorials. Alternately, we recommend trying one of the beginner
    tutorials on [%{partner_url}/learn](%{codeorg_url}/learn) to start, such as the
    tutorial with Angry Birds or with Anna and Elsa. A high school student should
    be able to finish one of these in 30 minutes and can then try a more advanced
    tutorial in JavaScript, such as Khan Academy or CodeHS.
  hoc_faq_scratch_q: Eg skal bruke Scratch i Kodetimen, men kva om elevane har iPads
    i staden for laptops?
  hoc_faq_scratch_a: Scratch køyrer ikkje på nettbrett. Om elvane er unge, kan dei
    bruke appen ScratchJR for iPad (for dei som kan lese). Om du ser på oppgåvene
    på<a href='%{codeorg_url}/learn'>%{partner_url}/learn</a> kan du finne andre oppgåver
    som passar for iPad - frå Code.org, Tynker, Lightbot eller CodeSpark.
  hoc_faq_scratch_a_markdown: Scratch doesn't run on tablets. If your students are
    young, they can use the ScratchJR iPad app (for early-readers). If you look at
    the tutorials on [%{partner_url}/learn](%{codeorg_url}/learn), you can find other
    tutorials that work on iPads - from Code.org, Tynker, Lightbot, or CodeSpark.
  hoc_faq_count_hoc_q: Hvordan tel de kodetimar?
  hoc_faq_map_q: Kvifor ser eg ikkje min prikk på kartet?
  hoc_faq_map_a: Vi er veldig lei oss for at du ikkje ser arrangementet ditt på kartet
    over Kodetimen. Fordi titusenvis av organisatorar melder seg på vil kartet samle
    fleire arrangement under kvar prikk. Viss du klikkar på <a href='%{events_url}'>sida
    for arrangement</a>-lenka under kartet vil du få opp ei liste over alle arrangement
    for kvar region og finne arrangementet ditt der. I tillegg vil det ofte ta opp
    til 48 timar før kartet oppdaterar seg på grunn av det er tusenvis av påmeldingar.
    Sjekk igjen om nokre få dagar!
  hoc_faq_map_a_markdown: We're so sorry you aren't seeing your event on the Hour
    of Code map. Because of the tens of thousands of organizers who sign up, the map
    aggregates the data and displays one point for several events. If you click the
    [events page](%{events_url}) link below the map you will be directed to a list
    of all events by state and can find your event listed there. Additionally, given
    the thousands of people signing up for the Hour of Code, the map and event list
    usually takes 48 hours to update. Check back in a few days!
  hoc_faq_count_hoc_a: Teljaren for Kodetimen er ikkje heilt nøyaktig. Vi tel ikkje
    unike elevar eksakt når vi måler deltakinga på Kodetimen, særskilt kjem dette
    av at vi ikkje krev innlogging eller registrering. Dette fører til at vi både
    tel for mange og for få heile tida. Les fleire detaljar om dette <a href='%{codeorg_url}/loc'>her</a>.
  hoc_faq_count_hoc_a_markdown: 'We do not count unique student IDs perfectly when
    tracking participation in the Hour of Code. Why? Partly because we don''t want
    the friction of prompting to “login / register” before a student or classroom
    tries learning for the first time, and partly because there are may activities
    we cannot track online. We do take certain steps to reduce double-counting, but
    without a login prompt, this can''t work perfectly. At the same time, there are
    MANY student activities in the Hour of Code that aren''t tracked at all. For example:
    (1) students who use a mobile/tablet app to try the Hour of Code are typically
    not counted (2) students who share a screen for pair-programming or group-programming
    may be counted as one (3) students trying an unplugged classroom activity cannot
    be counted online (4) teachers who create their own Hour of Code activities. As
    a result, there is some under-counting and some double-counting, and so we do
    not view the Hour of Code tracker to be an exact measure of usage. It is certainly
    directionally correct, and shows that many tens of millions of students have participated.'
  hoc_faq_one_hour_q: Hvor mye kan ein lære i ein time?
  hoc_faq_one_hour_a: Målet til Kodetimen er ikkje at nokon skal bli ekspert i informatikk
    eller koding på ein time. Ein time er berre nok til å lære at informatikk er moro
    og kreativt, tilgjengeleg for alle aldrar og alle elevar uansett bakgrunn. Suksess
    for kampanja blir ikkje målt i kor mykje informatikk elevane lærer - suksessen
    blir vist gjennom brei deltaking på tvers av kjønn, etnisitet og sosioøkonomisk
    gruppe, og i auken av påmeldingar til informatikk-kurs på alle nivå. Millionar
    av deltakande lærarar og elevar har vald å gå utover den eine timen - for å fortsetje
    læringa i dagar og veker, og mange elevar har meldt seg på større kurs (til og
    med på høgskule og universitetsnivå) som eit resultat.<br/><br/>I tillegg får
    også læraren sjøv verdifull læring. Etter ein kodetime er ein trygg på at ein
    kan lære vekk koding sjølv utan å ha høgare utdanning i informatikk. Titusenvis
    av lærarar har vald å gå vidare med informatikk og teke etterutdanning og/eller
    nettbaserte kurs. Dette gjeld også for skulesjefar som vil forstå at informatikk
    er noko elevane ønskjer og lærarane meistrar.<br/><br/>Det viktigaste av alt er
    at alle deltakarane i løpet av den timen skjønar at dette får vi til.
  hoc_faq_one_hour_a_markdown: |-
    The goal of the Hour of Code is not to teach anybody to become an expert computer scientist in one hour. One hour is only enough to learn that computer science is fun and creative, that it is accessible at all ages, for all students, regardless of background. The measure of success of this campaign is not in how much CS students learn - the success is reflected in broad participation across gender, racial/ethnic, and socioeconomic groups, and the resulting increase in enrollment and participation we see in CS courses at all grade levels. Millions of the participating teachers and students have decided to go beyond one hour -  to learn for a whole day or a whole week or longer, and many students have decided to enroll in a whole course (or even a college major) as a result.

    Besides the students, another "learner" is the educator who gains the confidence after one hour that they can teach computer science even though they may not have a college degree as a computer scientist. Tens of thousands of teachers decide to pursue computer science further, either attending PD or offering follow-on online courses, or both. And this applies to school administrators too, who realize that computer science is something their students want and their teachers are capable of.

    Above all, what all participants can learn in an hour is that we can do this.
