A MobileNet model is a <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/practica/image-classification/convolutional-neural-networks">convolutional neural network</a> that has been trained on <a href="http://www.image-net.org/">ImageNet</a>, a dataset of over 14 million images hand-annotated with words such as "balloon" or "strawberry". In order to customize this model with the labeled training data the student generates in this activity, we use a technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning">Transfer Learning</a>. Each image in the training dataset is fed to MobileNet, as pixels, to obtain a list of annotations that are most likely to apply to it. Then, for a new image, we feed it to MobileNet and compare its resulting list of annotations to those from the training dataset. We classify the new image with the same label (such as "fish" or "not fish") as the images from the training set with the most similar results.'

[Click here to see our flexible units](%)."
  csd_page_faq_question_04: "What materials and supplies are required for CS Discoveries?"
  csd_page_faq_answer_04_01: "One potential cost to consider when teaching this course is printing. Many lessons have handouts that are designed to guide students through activities. While it is not required that all of these handouts be printed, many were designed to be printed and we highly recommend printing when possible."
  csd_page_faq_answer_04_02: "Beyond printing, some lessons call for typical classroom supplies and manipulatives such as: Student journals, poster paper, markers/colored pencils, scissors, scrap paper, glue or tape, post-it notes or index cards (or similar sized scrap paper), and rulers or a straight edge of some kind."
  csd_page_faq_answer_04_03: "In addition to those general course materials, the following items are called for in specific units:"

  hoc_faq_account_a: "No. Absolutely no signup or login is required for students to try the Hour of Code.

  hoc_faq_high_school_a: "Our Star Wars and Minecraft tutorials are great for high schoolers, especially the Star Wars JavaScript version and the free play level on both tutorials. Alternately, we recommend trying one of the beginner tutorials on <a href='%{codeorg_url}/learn'>%{partner_url}/learn</a> to start, such as the tutorial with Angry Birds or with Anna and Elsa. A high school student should be able to finish one of these in 30 minutes and can then try a more advanced tutorial in JavaScript, such as Khan Academy or CodeHS."

  hoc_faq_scratch_a: "Scratch doesn't run on tablets. If your students are young, they can use the ScratchJR iPad app (for early-readers).

  hoc_faq_map_a: "We're so sorry you aren't seeing your event on the Hour of Code map. Because of the tens of thousands of organizers who sign up, the map aggregates the data and displays one point for several events. If you click the <a href='%{events_url}'>events page</a> link below the map you will be directed to a list of all events by state and can find your event listed there. Additionally, given the thousands of people signing up for the Hour of Code, the map and event list usually takes 48 hours to update. Check back in a few days!"

  hoc_faq_count_hoc_a: "The Hour of Code tracker isn't an exact measurement of usage. We do not count unique student IDs perfectly when tracking participation in the Hour of Code, especially because we don't require students to log in or register. As a result, we both over-count and under-count participants at the same time. Read all the details <a href='%{codeorg_url}/loc'>here</a>."
  hoc_faq_count_hoc_a_markdown: "We do not count unique student IDs perfectly when tracking participation in the Hour of Code. Why? Partly because we don't want the friction of prompting to “login / register” before a student or classroom tries learning for the first time, and partly because there are may activities we cannot track online. We do take certain steps to reduce double-counting, but without a login prompt, this can't work perfectly. At the same time, there are MANY student activities in the Hour of Code that aren't tracked at all. For example: (1) students who use a mobile/tablet app to try the Hour of Code are typically not counted (2) students who share a screen for pair-programming or group-programming may be counted as one (3) students trying an unplugged classroom activity cannot be counted online (4) teachers who create their own Hour of Code activities. As a result, there is some under-counting and some double-counting, and so we do not view the Hour of Code tracker to be an exact measure of usage. It is certainly directionally correct, and shows that many tens of millions of students have participated."
  hoc_faq_one_hour_q: "How much can one learn in an hour?"
  hoc_faq_one_hour_a: 'The goal of the Hour of Code is not to teach anybody to become an expert computer scientist in one hour. One hour is only enough to learn that computer science is fun and creative, that it is accessible at all ages, for all students, regardless of background. The measure of success of this campaign is not in how much CS students learn - the success is reflected in broad participation across gender and ethnic and socioeconomic groups, and the resulting increase in enrollment and participation we see in CS courses at all grade levels. Millions of the participating teachers and students have decided to go beyond one hour -  to learn for a whole day or a whole week or longer, and many students have decided to enroll in a whole course (or even a college major) as a result. <br/><br/> Besides the students, another "learner" is the educator who gains the confidence after one hour that they can teach computer science even though they may not have a college degree as a computer scientist. Tens of thousands of teachers decide to pursue computer science further, either attending PD or offering follow-on online courses, or both. And this applies to school administrators too, who realize that computer science is something their students want and their teachers are capable of. <br/><br/> Above all, what all participants can learn in an hour is that we can do this.'

  engineering_team_card_text_2: "If you are interested in applying for one of our roles, we'd love to hear from you! You can find a list of open positions on our Careers page."
  engineering_our_team_title: "Our engineering team"
  engineering_our_team_desc: "The engineering team at Code.org is divided into four sub-teams that build and support different areas of our platform:"
  engineering_our_team_sub_title_1: "Student Learning Team"
  engineering_our_team_text_1: "Our Student Learning Team owns all our activities (we call them labs) that our students use each day. This team works mostly on front-end tech (we use React and a lot of custom JS) and we have a great working relationship with many partners and open source projects. For example, we use [Google's Blockly](%{youtube_url}) for all of our block-based programming. We support students in their learning journey all the way from Kindergarten through 12th grade."
  engineering_our_team_sub_title_2: "Teacher Experience Team"
  engineering_our_team_text_2: "Our Teacher Experience Team builds the tools that attract new teachers to Code.org (we call these acquisition products) and develops the platform that empowers our existing teachers to teach our curriculum (our teacher tools). As with our student tools, we rely on React to build our front-end and our server-side components are served using Ruby on Rails."
  engineering_our_team_sub_title_3: "Platform Team"
  engineering_our_team_text_3: "Our Platform Team owns core components that serve the needs of our student and teacher teams (for example, authentication and user profile) and also has the mission of reaching students who we can't yet reach. This includes building integrations that connect us with schools that use different Learning Management Systems (LMS) and packaging our curriculum so that it can be used in remote schools who don't have access to reliable internet."
  engineering_our_team_sub_title_4: "Infrastructure Team"
  engineering_our_team_text_4: "Our Infrastructure Team provides the backbone for the platform that supports our students and teachers. This includes our hosting infrastructure and related services (we use AWS), data management, security programs, developer and deployment services and much more. This team also owns our scaling and provisioning systems, which are critical during Hour of Code, where we invite every student in the world to complete an hour of coding with us."
  engineering_faq_question_1: "What does Code.org do?"
  engineering_faq_answer_1_a: "Code.org is an education innovation nonprofit dedicated to the vision that every student in every school has the opportunity to learn computer science as part of their core K-12 education."
  engineering_faq_answer_1_b: "We expand access to computer science in schools, with a focus on increasing participation by young women and students from other underrepresented groups. The leading provider of K-12 computer science curriculum in the largest school districts in the United States, Code.org also organizes the annual Hour of Code campaign, which has engaged more than 15% of all students in the world."
  engineering_faq_answer_1_c: "Code.org is supported by generous donors including Microsoft, Amazon, Google and many others."
  engineering_faq_question_2: "What is Code.org’s developer experience and tooling?"
  engineering_faq_answer_2: "Our developer experience may be different to what you’ve seen in your past roles. Working closely with our product team, we ship to production every weekday and we have a variety of cadences - sometimes you are writing code that goes live that day; other times you are on longer term projects - and while we do follow 2-weekly sprints, we do so in a lightweight way. We index towards getting the right things done the right way vs. taking a purist view of any particular methodology. [All our code](%{code_url}) is open source and we use JIRA and GitHub pull requests to track all of our work items. We also care a lot about quality and testing and are fortunate to have incredible support from [SauceLabs](%{saucelabs_url}), who help us run our suite of UI tests on various student devices (e.g., iPads) in their cloud device farm."
  engineering_faq_question_3: "What is the engineer on-call rotation at Code.org?"
  engineering_faq_answer_3: 'Our 30+ engineering team shares on-call responsibilities. Each engineer covers a 24-hour shift and uses our escalation paths and playbooks to respond to site outages or other live-site issues. We are proud of our site’s reliability - on average, each engineer is only woken up once per year for issues that are typically quick to resolve. Instead, the "Developer of the Day" usually spends a portion of their workday managing the production deployment and triaging less urgent issues.'
  engineering_faq_question_4: "Are you a remote-friendly / WFH organization?"
