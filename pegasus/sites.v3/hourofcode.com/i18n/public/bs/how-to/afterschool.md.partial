# How to teach one Hour of Code in after-school classes and clubs

### Priključi se pokretu i predstavi grupi učenika njihov prvi čas računarstva sa ovim koracima. Čas Kodiranja je lako pokrenuti - čak i za početnike! If you'd like an extra set of hands to help out, you can find a [local volunteer]({{ urls/volunteer_local }}) to help run an Hour of Code in your after-school class or club.

## 1. Watch this how-to video <iframe width="500" height="255" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/SrnvvWDm73k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen mark="crwd-mark"></iframe> 

## 2. Choose a tutorial

We provide a variety of [fun, hour-long tutorials]({{ urls/learn }}) for participants all ages, created by a variety of partners. [Try them out!]({{ urls/learn }})

**All Hour of Code tutorials** require minimal prep-time for organizers, and are self-guided - allowing kids to work at their own pace and skill-level.

## 3. Promote your Hour of Code

Promote your Hour of Code [with these tools]({{ urls/promote }}) and encourage others to host their own events.

## 4. Plan your technology needs - computers are optional

Najbolja Čas Kodiranja iskustva uključuju kompjutere koji su povezani s internetom. But you **don’t** need a computer for every child, and you can even do the Hour of Code without a computer at all.

Make sure to test tutorials on student computers or devices to ensure they work properly on browsers with sound and video. **Have low bandwidth?** Plan to show videos at the front of the class, so each student isn't downloading their own videos. Or try the unplugged / offline tutorials.

Provide headphones for your class, or ask students to bring their own, if the tutorial you choose works best with sound.

**Don't have enough devices?** Use [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q). When students partner up, they help each other and rely less on the teacher. Oni će također vidjeti da je računarstvo socijalno i kolaborativno.

## 5. Start your Hour of Code off with an inspiring video

Kick off your Hour of Code by inspiring participants and discussing how computer science impacts every part of our lives.

**Pokaži inspiracioni video:**

- The original Code.org launch video, featuring Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and NBA star Chris Bosh - there are [1 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYZF6oIZtfc), [5 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc), and [9 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1xS07N-FA) versions available.
- The [Hour of Code Worldwide video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsOIlDT145A)

- Find more inspirational videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNfpD8i4Sx7U0y2MccnrNZuP).

**It’s okay if you are all brand new to computer science. Here are some ideas to introduce your Hour of Code activity:**

- Objasnite na koje načine tehnologija utječe naše živote, s primjerima koji će biti zanimljivi kako dječacima tako i djevojčicama (Razgovarajte o aplikacijama i tehnologiji koja se koriste za spašavanje života, pomoć ljudima, povezuje ljude itd).
- List things that use code in everyday life.
- See tips for getting girls interested in computer science [here]({{ urls/girls }}).

## 6. Code!

**Direct participants to the activity** - Write the tutorial link on a whiteboard. Find the link listed on the [information for your selected tutorial]({{ urls/learn }}) under the number of participants.

**When someone comes across difficulties it's okay to respond:** - “I don’t know. Let’s figure this out together.” - “Technology doesn’t always work out the way we want.” - “Learning to program is like learning a new language; you won’t be fluent right away.”

**What to do if someone finishes early?** - Encourage participants to try another Hour of Code activity at [hourofcode.com/learn]({{ urls/learn }}) - Or, ask those who finish early to help others who are having trouble.

## 7. Slaviti

- [Print certificates]({{ urls/certificates }}) for your students.
- [Print "I did an Hour of Code!"]({{ promote/resources_stickers }}) stickers for your students.
- [Order custom t-shirts](http://blog.code.org/post/132608499493/hour-of-code-shirts-and-more) for participants.
- Share photos and videos of your Hour of Code event on social media. Use #HourOfCode and @codeorg so we can highlight your success, too!
