# Návod pro dobrovolníky

## Proč se stát dobrovolníkem?

Zde jsou výpovědi některých našich dobrovolníků:

- "Nejlepší podle mého názoru bylo, že celá třída byly ženy a lidé mnoha ras. Je dobrým znamením pro budoucnost tohoto průmyslu mít šanci zaujmout tyto děti."
- "Především jsem byl rád, že jsem měl možnost podporovat mladá děvčata, zajímat se o technologie. Měl jsem pocit, že jsem pomáhal rozvíjet příští generaci v tom, co dělám."
- "Bylo skvělé vidět, jak byly děti nadšené. Skvělé bylo, když si učitelé všimli, že někteří studenti, kteří akademicky nevynikali, excelovali jako vývojáři a dokonce pomáhali ostatním. To jim dodávalo sebevědomí."
