**"Hour of Code" is trademarked. We don't want to prevent this usage, but we want to make sure it fits within a few limits:**

  1. Setiap mereferensikan "Hour of Code" harus tidak mengatakan bahwa nama merek tersebut adalah milik anda, tetapi referensikan Hour of Code sebagai akar/inti dari gerakan/kampanye ini. Contoh baik: "Berpartisipasilan dalam Hour of Code™ di ACMECorp.com". Bad example: "Try Hour of Code by ACME Corp".
  2. Use a "TM" superscript in the most prominent places you mention "Hour of Code", both on your web site and in app descriptions.
  3. Sertakan bahasa pada halaman (atau pada footer), termasuk dalam alamat menuju CSEdWeek dan situs web Code.org, yang memilki tulisan:
    
    *"'Hour of Code™' adalah gerakan global dari Pekan Edukasi Ilmu Komputer [csedweek.org] dan Code.org [code.org] untuk mengenalkan jutaan siswa dengan sesi satu jam dari ilmu komputer dan pemrograman komputer."*

  4. No use of "Hour of Code" in app names.

Computers are everywhere, changing every industry on the planet. But fewer than half of all schools teach computer science. Kabar baiknya, kita berada pada jalur yang tepat untuk merubah itu. If you've heard about the Hour of Code before, you might know it made history. More than 100 million students have tried an Hour of Code.

With the Hour of Code, computer science has been on homepages of Google, MSN, Yahoo! dan Disney. Over 100 partners have joined together to support this movement. Every Apple Store in the world has hosted an Hour of Code. President Obama wrote his first line of code as part of the campaign.

This year, let's make it even bigger. I’m asking you to join in for the Hour of Code 2016. Please get involved with an Hour of Code event during Computer Science Education Week, <%= campaign_date('full') %>.

Get the word out. Host an event. Ask a local school to sign up. Or try the Hour of Code yourself—everyone can benefit from learning the basics.

**Subject line:** Local school joins mission to introduce students to computer science

Computers are everywhere, changing every industry on the planet, but fewer than half of all schools teach computer science. Girls and minorities are severely underrepresented in computer science classes, and in the tech industry. Kabar baiknya, kita berada pada jalur yang tepat untuk merubah itu.

With the Hour of Code, computer science has been on homepages of Google, MSN, Yahoo! dan Disney. Over 100 partners have joined together to support this movement. Every Apple Store in the world has hosted an Hour of Code. President Obama wrote his first line of code as part of the campaign.

That’s why every one of the [X number] students at [SCHOOL NAME] are joining in on the largest learning event in history: The Hour of Code, during Computer Science Education Week (<%= campaign_date('full') %>).

I'm writing to invite you to attend our kickoff assembly, and to see kids start the activity on [DATE].

The Hour of Code, organized by the nonprofit Code.org and over 100 others, is a global movement that believes the students of today are ready to learn critical skills for 21st century success. Please join us.

Dear Parents,

We live in a world surrounded by technology. And we know that whatever field our students choose to go into as adults, their ability to succeed will increasingly depend on understanding how technology works.

But only a tiny fraction of us are learning **how** technology works. Fewer than half of all schools teach computer science.

That’s why our entire school is joining in on the largest learning event in history: The Hour of Code, during Computer Science Education Week (<%= campaign_date('full') %>). More than 100 million students worldwide have already tried an Hour of Code.

Our Hour of Code is making a statement that [SCHOOL NAME] is ready to teach these foundational 21st century skills. To continue bringing programming activities to your students, we want to make our Hour of Code event huge. I encourage you to volunteer, reach out to local media, share the news on social media channels and consider hosting additional Hour of Code events in the community.

This is a chance to change the future of education in [TOWN/CITY NAME].

See http://hourofcode.com/<%= @country %> for details, and help spread the word.

Sincerely,

Your principal

Dear [Mayor/Governor/Representative/Senator LAST NAME]:

Did you know that computing is the #1 source of wages in the U.S.? There are more than 500,000 computing jobs open nationwide, but last year only 42,969 computer science students graduated into the workforce.

Computer science is foundational for *every* industry today. Yet most schools don’t teach it. At [SCHOOL NAME], we are trying to change that.

That’s why our entire school is joining in on the largest learning event in history: The Hour of Code, during Computer Science Education Week (<%= campaign_date('full') %>). More than 100 million students worldwide have already tried an Hour of Code.

I'm writing to invite you to take part in our Hour of Code event and speak at our kickoff assembly. It’ll take place on [DATE, TIME, PLACE], and will make a strong statement that [State or City name] is ready to teach our students critical 21st century skills. We want to ensure that our students are on the forefront of creating technology of the future—not just consuming it.

Please contact me at [PHONE NUMBER OR EMAIL ADDRESS]. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely, [NAME], [TITLE]
