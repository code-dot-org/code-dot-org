# How to bring the Hour of Code to your entire school district

## Get every school participating, every student learning!

1. **Recruit local schools.** Share [this email](<%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#sample-emails') %>) and [teacher how to guide](<%= resolve_url('/how-to') %>), or include a [short blurb](<%= resolve_url('/promote/stats') %>) in newsletters/district communications.

2. **Provide a sample logistics plan for schools.** Share this [sample logistics plan](<%= localized_file('/files/HOC_Logistics_plan.pdf') %>) with schools to give them ideas of how to organize whole school participation. It’s as easy as doing it in every math class, homeroom period, or rotating throughout the week through the computer lab.

3. **Share on social media.** Post to [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fhourofcode.com%2Fus) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhourofcode.com&text=I%27m%20participating%20in%20this%20year%27s%20%23HourOfCode%2C%20are%20you%3F%20%40codeorg&original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fq%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Ftwitter.com%252Fshare%253Fhashtags%253D%2526amp%253Brelated%253Dcodeorg%2526amp%253Btext%253DI%252527m%252Bparticipating%252Bin%252Bthis%252Byear%252527s%252B%252523HourOfCode%25252C%252Bare%252Byou%25253F%252B%252540codeorg%2526amp%253Burl%253Dhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fhourofcode.com%26sa%3DD%26sntz%3D1%26usg%3DAFQjCNE1GLTUbKZfMlEh9Aj5w0iswz6PYQ&related=codeorg&hashtags=). Or share one of these inspirational [pictures and quotes](<%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#social') %>) from world leaders, or [stats](<%= resolve_url('/promote/stats') %>).

4. **Promote on your district’s homepage.** Let visitors know about your participation and Hour of Code events. Link it to [Hour of Code](<%= resolve_url('/') %>).

5. **Host a district Hour of Code event.** See our [event how to guide](<%= resolve_url('/how-to/events') %>) for a sample run of show, media outreach kit and other supports.

The Hour of Code is just the first step on a journey to learn more about how technology works and how to create software applications. To continue this journey:

- Encourage students to continue to [learn online](<%= codeorg_url('/learn/beyond') %>).
- [Attend](<%= codeorg_url('/professional-development-workshops') %>) a 1-day, in-person workshop to receive instruction from an experienced computer science facilitator. (US educators only)
