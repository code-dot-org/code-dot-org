# Prizes - FAQs

## Ali se mora vključiti celotna šola, da pridobi možnost zadeti $10.000 strojne opreme?

Yes. Your whole school has to participate to be eligible for the prize but only one person needs to register and submit the Hardware Prize application form [here](<%= resolve_url('/prizes') %>).

## Ali se mora vključiti celotna šola, da pridobi možnost zadeti video pogovor?

Any classroom (public or private school) is eligible to win this prize. Your whole school need not apply.

## Ali lahko ne-javne šole zadenejo video pogovor?

Yes! Private and independent schools are eligible along with public schools to win the video chat prizes.

## Ali lahko šole izven ZDA zadanejo možnosti video pogovora?

No, unfortunately, because of logistics we are unable to offer the video chat prize to schools outside of the U.S. and Canada.

## Zakaj je nagrada $10.000 strojne opreme na voljo samo javnim šolam?

We would love to help teachers in public and private schools alike, but at this time, it comes down to logistics. We have partnered with [DonorsChoose.org](http://donorschoose.org) to administer classroom funding prizes, which only works with public, US K-12 schools. According to DonorsChoose.org, the organization is better able to access consistent and accurate data that's available for public schools.

## Sem izven ZDA. Ali se lahko kvalificiram za nagrade?

Due to a small full-time staff, Code.org is unable to handle the logistics of administering international prizes. Because of this people outside the US are unable to qualify for prizes.

## Kakšen je rok za prijavo za nagrado strojne opreme?

To qualify, your entire school must register for the Hour of Code as well as complete the [Hardware Application form](<%= resolve_url('/prizes') %>) by November 16, 2015. Ena šola v vsaki zvezni državi ZDA bo dobila prenosnike za en cel razred. Code.org will select and notify winners via email by December 1, 2015.

## Kdaj je rok, da se zadane tehnološki klepet?

To qualify, you must register your classroom for the Hour of Code by November 2, 2015. Classrooms will win a video chat with a celebrity. Code.org will select and notify winners via email by December 1, 2015.

## Kdaj bom obveščen, da je moja šola ali razred dobila nagrado?

To qualify, your entire school must register for the Hour of Code as well as complete the [Hardware Application form](<%= resolve_url('/prizes') %>) by November 16, 2015. Code.org will select and notify winners via email by December 1, 2015.

## If my whole school can’t do the Hour of Code during Computer Science Education Week (Dec. 7-13), can I still qualify for prizes?

Yes, just be sure to submit a logistics plan that outlines how your whole school is participating over a reasonable length of time and register for the Hour of Code by November 16th.
