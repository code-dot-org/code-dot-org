# Как да проведете Hour of Code във Вашата компания

### Find out how you and your employees can inspire students to try computer science!

---

## Connect with local classrooms and volunteer for the Hour of Code

Code.org offers the opportunity for your employees to [connect](<%= codeorg_url('/volunteer') %>) with local classrooms doing the Hour of Code where they can share their tech career experience and inspire students to study computer science.

[<button>Sign up to volunteer!</button>](<%= codeorg_url('/volunteer') %>) <br /> <br />

For more instructions on encouraging employees and connecting your employees with classrooms, check out our [guide for corporate partners](<%= localized_file('/files/hoc-corporate-toolkit.pdf') %>).

## Additional ways companies can support the Hour of Code

- Ask your CEO to [send a company-wide email](<%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#sample-emails') %>) emphasizing the importance of computer science and encouraging employees to spread the word.
- Host an Hour of Code Happy Hour with coworkers to try the [activities](<%= resolve_url('/learn') %>).
- Host an Hour of Code event for a local classroom of students or non profits partners to do an Hour of Code at your company’s office. See event how-to guide below.

# How to host an Hour of Code event with students

## 1. Promote your Hour of Code

- Promote your [Hour of Code](<%= resolve_url('/promote') %>) event and encourage others to host.
- Encourage software engineers at your company to visit a local classroom to help lead an Hour of Code and inspire students to study computer science. They can [sign up](<%= codeorg_url('/volunteer/engineer') %>) to be connected with a classroom.

## 3. Choose an activity

We host a variety of [fun, hour-long activities](<%= resolve_url('/learn') %>) for participants of all ages, created by a variety of partners. [ Изпробвайте ги!](<%= resolve_url('/learn') %>)

**All Hour of Code activities** require minimal prep-time, and are self-guided - allowing participants to work at their own pace and skill-level.

## 4. Plan your technology needs - computers are optional

Най-добрият Hour of Code се провежда с Интернет свързани компютри. But you **don’t** need a computer for every participant, and you can even do the Hour of Code without a computer at all.

**Plan Ahead!** Do the following before your event starts:

- Test activities on computers or devices. Make sure they work properly on browsers with sound and video.
- Provide headphones, or ask participants to bring their own, if the activity you choose works best with sound.
- **Няма достатъчно устройства?** Използвайте [ програмиране по двойки](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q). When participants partner up, they help each other and rely less on the organizer. Те ще се убедят, че компютърните науки се нуждаят от социално сътрудничество.
- **Have low bandwidth?** Plan to show videos at the front of the event, so each participant isn't downloading their own videos. Or try the unplugged / offline activities.

## 5. Start your Hour of Code off with an inspiring video

Преди началото на събитието, вдъхновете децата с обсъждане как компютърните науки влияят върху всяка част от живота ни. Share more about what inspired you to pursue computer science and your role at your company.

**Покажи вдъхновяващо видео:**

- The original Code.org launch video, featuring Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and NBA star Chris Bosh (there are [1 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYZF6oIZtfc), [5 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc), and [9 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1xS07N-FA) versions).
- [ Видео за световния Час на кода](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsOIlDT145A)
- [ президентът Обама призовава всички ученици да учат компютърни науки](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvmhE1J9PY).

**Ideas to introduce your Hour of Code activity to students:**

- Explain ways technology impacts our lives, with examples both boys and girls will care about - talk about technology that’s saving lives, helping people, connecting people.
- If you are a tech company, demo fun, innovative products your company is working on.
- If you aren’t a tech company, discuss ways your company uses technology to solve problems and accomplish goals.
- Invite software engineers from your company to speak about why they decided to study computer science and the projects they work on.
- See tips for getting girls interested in computer science [here](<%= codeorg_url('/girls') %>).

## 6. Code!

**Пряко участие в дейността**

- Write the activity link on a whiteboard. Find the link listed on the [information for your selected activity](<%= resolve_url('/learn') %>) under the number of participants.
- For younger students, load the activity page ahead of time or save it as a bookmark.

**When participants come across difficulties it's okay to respond:**

- "Аз не знам. Нека да разберем това заедно."
- "Да се научиш да програмираш е като изучаването на нов език; няма да го овладееш веднага."

**Какво да направя ако някой завършва по-рано?**

- They can try another Hour of Code activity at hourofcode.com/learn.
- Or, ask them to help a friend who are having trouble with the activity.

## 7) Празник

- [Print certificates](<%= codeorg_url('/certificates') %>) for participants and students.
