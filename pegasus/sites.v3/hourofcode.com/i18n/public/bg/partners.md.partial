Часът на кода се ръководи от Hour of Code и Computer Science Education Week консултативни и ревизионни комисии.

The [Advisory Committee]({{ urls/advisory_committee }}) is composed of representatives from K-12, academia, nonprofits, for-profits, and international organizations. Този комитет изработва стратегия за кампанията на часът на кода.

The [Review Committee]({{ urls/review_committee }}) is composed of 15 educators across K-12 grade bands that assess and recommend activities using the Advisory Committee's rubric. These educators review student-led activities and teacher-led lesson plans submitted by hundreds of activity partners, evaluating the activities' educational value, ability to engage learners, and potential appeal to diverse sets of students.

Така тяхната работа допринася за успеха на Hour of Code и визията им за Въведение в компютърните науки за всеки ученик.
