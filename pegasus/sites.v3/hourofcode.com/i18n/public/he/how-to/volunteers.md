# How-to Guide for Volunteers

## 1. Sign up to volunteer

Visit a local classroom to inspire students to keep learning computer science. [Volunteer for an hour](https://code.org/volunteer/engineer).

## 2. Join a volunteer info session

We'll be hosting two info sessions to explain what a typical volunteer experience will be like. We'll discuss how to coordinate with teachers before their Hour of Code event and also what you should do the day of the event to prepare. Please come with your questions! These info sessions will be hosted via Hangouts on Air, so if you miss it you can still catch the recorded session later. [See the agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y2PjgICSEnYGTD7MT1mvLS6RvA9BJDG4zWheD0ZFIUo/edit?usp=sharing).

## 3. Spend 30 minutes trying the tutorials beforehand

Try the Hour of Code tutorials at [code.org/learn](https://code.org/learn). Pick a few of the most popular tutorials and spend some time to get familiar with each of them. It will take you about 5-10 minutes per tutorial to get a sense of how it works.

## 4. Recruit your co-workers to volunteer

Tell your friends and co-workers about the Hour of Code. We have thousands of teachers signing up and looking for volunteers, so ask them to [sign up as a volunteer](https://code.org/volunteer).

**Sample email:**

**Subject line**: Join me in volunteering for the Hour of Code

If you remember your very first line of code, you know it shaped the rest of your life.

That’s what the Hour of Code is all about. In the last three years, the movement has shattered stereotypes in tech and helped more than 100 million students in 180 countries try computer science for the first time.

**I signed up to volunteer in a local classroom, and you can, too!**   
Code.org is matching classrooms with technical volunteers like you who can help students and teachers through their first Hour of Code.

Please [volunteer for an hour](https://code.org/volunteer/engineer). After you sign up, local teachers will be able to contact you for help using a secure form.

Can’t volunteer? [Help spread the word about the Hour of Code instead!](https://hourofcode.com/promote).

**Your experience matters**  
Most schools still don’t teach computer science. Most students don’t know that coding is about solving big problems and connecting people. This is a chance to inspire at least one young person in your area.

*Your email address will never be shared with teachers.

## 5. Ask your employer to get involved

[Send this email](https://hourofcode.com/promote/resources#email) to your manager, or the CEO.

## 6. Promote the Hour of Code in your community

Cluburi, biserici, universitati, grup de veterani sau reintalniri - Recruteaza un grup local. Sau poti organiza o petrecere Hour of Code pentru cartierul tau. [Send this email](https://hourofcode.com/promote/resources#email).

## 7. Prepare before you visit a classroom.

Review a typical agenda below, and [review these tips](https://code.org/files/CSTT_Volunteers.pdf) about how to connect with students during your visit.

# Agenda for Volunteering in a Classroom

### 1. Sign into the school and greet the teacher. Confirm the agreed schedule and discuss any talking points.

### 2. Bring stuff from your company like stickers. Kids love anything they can interact with.

### 3. Spend 5-10 minutes talking about computer science: how it impacted you personally and how it has broad, worldwide impact. Answer any questions from students.

### 4. Play the [Hour of Code video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DxWIxec6yo)

### 5. Let the students dive into the tutorials. Walk around the classroom answering any questions and guiding them through tough puzzles. Try not to give students the solution outright. Instead try asking them questions so they can answer themselves what went wrong.
