# מדריך למתנדבים

### היו משמעותיים בכיתה היום!

## למה להתנדב?

קרא סיפורים של מתנדבים:

- “The best part of my experience was that the entire class were women and people of color. It bodes well for the future of our industry to have a chance to reach and excite these kids.”
- “Especially enjoyed getting to encourage young girls in technology. Felt like I was helping the next generation in my local area.”
- “I LOVED seeing how excited the kids were. One amazing thing was that the teachers noticed that some of the students who didn’t do as well academically were excelling at thinking like a developer and helping others learn - giving them a place to feel confident.”

## כל אחד יכול להתנדב

### מתנדבים ומרצים בהיי-טק:

יש לך קשר למדעי המחשב או להיי-טק? אם אתה עובד בהנדסת תוכנה, בכל תפקיד בחברת היי-טק (מהנדס או לא), או שלמדת קורסים במדעי המחשב, אתה יכול להוות השראה לתלמידים! תלמידים רבים לא פגשו מעולם מישהו שעובד בהייטק והמורים שלנו ישמחו לחבר בין הכיתה לבין אנשי מקצוע וסטודנטים באוניברסיטה.

תוכלו להיות מרצה אורח בכיתה או לעזור למורה בפעילות. בקרו בכיתה מקומית בכדי לתת השראה לתלמידים להמשיך בלימודי מדעי המחשב. <br /> <br />

            <strong>Code!</strong> Walk around, answer questions, and guide them through tough puzzles. Try not to give students the solution outright, instead, try asking them questions so they can answer themselves what went wrong, and encourage students to ask each other if they have questions. Learning from each other is a great learning opportunity.
