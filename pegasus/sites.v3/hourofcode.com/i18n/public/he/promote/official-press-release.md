“Daniels Run Elementary school held a school-wide Hour of Code event to expose its students to computer science. יותר מ-700 תלמידים מכל הכיתות עשו לפחות שעה של קוד אחת.

Computers are everywhere, but fewer schools teach computer science than 10 years ago. Girls and students of color are severely underrepresented. החדשות הטובות הן שאנחנו משנים את זה לטובה.

יותר מ-100 מיליון תלמידים מרחבי העולם כבר ניסו שעה של קוד. הודות לשעה של קוד, מדעי המחשב הופיעו בדף הבית של גוגל, MSN ו-Yahoo! and Disney. President Obama, Shakira and Ashton Kutcher all kicked off the Hour of Code with videos. Over 100 partners came together to support this movement.
