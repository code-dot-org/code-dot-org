# How to bring the Hour of Code to your company

### Find out how you and your employees can inspire students to try computer science!

---

## Connect with local classrooms and volunteer for the Hour of Code

Code.org offers the opportunity for your employees to [connect](<%= codeorg_url('/volunteer') %>) with local classrooms doing the Hour of Code where they can share their tech career experience and inspire students to study computer science.

[<button>Sign up to volunteer!</button>](<%= codeorg_url('/volunteer') %>) <br /> <br />

For more instructions on encouraging employees and connecting your employees with classrooms, check out our [guide for corporate partners](<%= localized_file('/files/hoc-corporate-toolkit.pdf') %>).

## Additional ways companies can support the Hour of Code

- Ask your CEO to [send a company-wide email](<%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#sample-emails') %>) emphasizing the importance of computer science and encouraging employees to spread the word.
- Host an Hour of Code Happy Hour with coworkers to try the [activities](<%= resolve_url('/learn') %>).
- Host an Hour of Code event for a local classroom of students or non profits partners to do an Hour of Code at your company’s office. See event how-to guide below.

We host a variety of [fun, hour-long activities](<%= resolve_url('/learn') %>) for participants of all ages, created by a variety of partners. Bain triail as iad

**All Hour of Code activities** require minimal prep-time, and are self-guided - allowing participants to work at their own pace and skill-level.

## 4. Plan your technology needs - computers are optional

Áirítear ar an taithí is fearr leis an gCód Uair den Chód ríomhairí ceangailte le Idirlíon. But you **don’t** need a computer for every participant, and you can even do the Hour of Code without a computer at all.

**Plan Ahead!** Do the following before your event starts:

- Test activities on computers or devices. Make sure they work properly on browsers with sound and video.
- Provide headphones, or ask participants to bring their own, if the activity you choose works best with sound.
- Nach bhfuil feistí leordhóthanach ann? Bain úsáid as cláir péire. When participants partner up, they help each other and rely less on the organizer. Feicfidh siad freisin go bhfuil an eolaíocht eolaíochta sóisialta agus comhoibríoch.
- **Have low bandwidth?** Plan to show videos at the front of the event, so each participant isn't downloading their own videos. Or try the unplugged / offline activities.

## 5. Cuir tús le d'Uairchód le físeán spreagúil

Ciceáil as do Uair de Chód trí rannpháirtithe a spreagadh agus plé a dhéanamh ar an dóigh a mbíonn tionchar ag ríomhaireachta ar gach cuid dár saol. Share more about what inspired you to pursue computer science and your role at your company.

- If you are a tech company, demo fun, innovative products your company is working on.
- If you aren’t a tech company, discuss ways your company uses technology to solve problems and accomplish goals.
- Invite software engineers from your company to speak about why they decided to study computer science and the projects they work on.
- See tips for getting girls interested in computer science [here](<%= codeorg_url('/girls') %>).
