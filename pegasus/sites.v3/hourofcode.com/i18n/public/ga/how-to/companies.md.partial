## 4. Plan your technology needs - computers are optional

Áirítear ar an taithí is fearr leis an gCód Uair den Chód ríomhairí ceangailte le Idirlíon. But you **don’t** need a computer for every participant, and you can even do the Hour of Code without a computer at all.

**Plan Ahead!** Do the following before your event starts:

- Test activities on computers or devices. Make sure they work properly on browsers with sound and video.
- Provide headphones, or ask participants to bring their own, if the activity you choose works best with sound.
- Nach bhfuil feistí leordhóthanach ann? Bain úsáid as cláir péire. When participants partner up, they help each other and rely less on the organizer. Feicfidh siad freisin go bhfuil an eolaíocht eolaíochta sóisialta agus comhoibríoch.
- **Have low bandwidth?** Plan to show videos at the front of the event, so each participant isn't downloading their own videos. Or try the unplugged / offline activities.

## 5. Cuir tús le d'Uairchód le físeán spreagúil

Ciceáil as do Uair de Chód trí rannpháirtithe a spreagadh agus plé a dhéanamh ar an dóigh a mbíonn tionchar ag ríomhaireachta ar gach cuid dár saol. Share more about what inspired you to pursue computer science and your role at your company.
