# Go raibh maith agat as síniú suas a óstáil Uair an Chóid!

<br /> **The Hour of Code runs during {{ campaign_date/full }} and we'll be in touch about new tutorials and other exciting updates as they come out. In the meantime, what can you do now?**

## 1. Spread the word in your school and community

You just joined the Hour of Code movement. Tell your friends with **#HourOfCode**!

{{ social_media_hoc }} <br /> Encourage others to participate [with our sample emails.]({{ promote/sample_emails }}) Contact your principal and challenge every classroom at your school to sign up. Recruit a local group — boy/girl scouts club, church, university, veterans group, labor union, or even some friends. You don't have to be in school to learn new skills. Invite a local politician or policy maker to visit your school for the Hour of Code. It can help build support for computer science in your area beyond one hour.

Use these [posters, banners, stickers, videos and more]({{ promote/resources }}) for your own event.

## 2. Find a local volunteer to help you with your event.

[Search our volunteer map]({{ urls/volunteer_local }}) for volunteers who can visit your classroom or video chat remotely to inspire your students about the breadth of possibilities with computer science.

## 3. Plan your Hour of Code

Choose an [Hour of Code activity](https://hourofcode.com/learn) for your classroom and [review this how-to guide]({{ urls/how_to_guide }}).

### 4. Stock up on swag

Order materials to help get students excited about your event by heading to the Code.org [Amazon store](https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/8557B2A6-EBF2-4C9F-95C5-C3256FBA0220). Order posters, Hour of Code kits, stickers, and more! But hurry, supplies are limited.
