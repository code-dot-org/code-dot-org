# Bài học hướng dẫn về "Giờ Lập Trình" và Tuần Giáo Dục Khoa học Máy tính

Code.org hosts a variety of Hour of Code™ activities, lessons, and videos on the Code.org and Hour of Code websites. The current list is at [hourofcode.com/learn]({{ urls/learn }}).

Code.org là trang chủ nơi tập trung rất nhiều những hoạt động, bài học và video của Giờ Lập Trình trên (các) trang web Code.org, Hour of Code, và CSEdWeek. Bạn có thể vào xem tất cả hoạt động đang diễn ra ở [hourofcode.com/learn]({{ urls/learn }}).

Bạn muốn gửi những trò chơi tự hướng dẫn của mình, bài học được giáo viên hướng dẫn, hay hoạt động giải thích nguyên tác cơ bản của khoa học máy tính? Hãy tham gia vào hoạt động toàn cầu này và giúp những người tham gia khắp thế giới bắt đầu với một giờ học mã hóa hay xa hơn nữa là những hoạt động với đa dạng bài học, kéo dài một ngày hay một tuần. (For example, any activities received after October 1, {{ campaign_date/year }} will not be listed for {{ campaign_date/year }}'s Hour of Code.) The deadline to submit for an early qualitative review [(details below)](#earlyreview) is August 16.</strong> If you have any questions about your activitiy submission, please reach out to us at support@code.org.

A few tips:

1. ** Gửi đi nhiều hơn một hoạt động**: Nếu bạn đang xây dựng các hoạt động cho nhiều mức độ khác nhau, độ tuổi khác nhau, hoặc nhiều thể loại khác, chúng tôi sẽ tạo danh sách các hoạt động ấy thành từng phần riêng để mỗi giáo viên có thể tìm được thứ mình cần cho lớp học của họ. Do vậy nếu bạn đã xây dựng trước một trang đích và đã gửi cho chúng tôi môt liên kết mạng đơn để quảng cáo, đừng làm như vậy nữa. Gửi đi mỗi hướng dẫn hay hoạt động cá nhân. Gửi số lượng bài nộp chúng tôi đã xem vài năm gần đây, chúng tôi sẽ dành thời gian để xem lại 5 hoạt động của mỗi thành viên.

2. **Về những bài học cho người mới bắt đầu**: ngoài những bài giảng cho giáo viên và học sinh lần đầu học về khoa học máy tính, chúng tôi sẽ làm danh sách những trải nghiệm về việc học khoa học máy tính- lớp học mở rộng cho những ai muốn tìm hiểu nhiều hơn nữa! Hãy giúp chúng tôi bằng việc gửi những bài học cho các lớp học đã hiểu về những điều cơ bản.

3. **Các môn học**: Bạn có ý tưởng giảng dạy nào về việc kết hợp Khoa học Máy tính vào môn Toán không? Lịch sử? Nghệ thuật ngôn ngữ? Khoa học? Mỹ thuật? Hay bất kỳ môn học nào khác? Chúng tôi nhận được nhiều yêu cầu từ giáo viên những người muốn kết nối Giờ học mã vào tiết giảng dạy của họ (đặc biệt với việc nâng cấp trình độ ISTE cho học sinh bao gồm "nhà thiết kế sáng tạo" và " những người biết tính toán"). Giáo viên có thể phân loại lớp học của họ theo nhiều cách( khối lớp hoặc môn học) vậy nên chúng tôi cần sự giúp đỡ của bạn để xây dựng các hoạt động hay lên kế hoạch giảng dạy liên quan đến CS cho lớp học mà phù hợp với mỗi môn học cho mỗi khối lớp riêng. Chúng tôi cũng tiếp tục thêm "Khoa học Máy tính" vao danh muc cho những giáo viên muốn tìm hiểu thêm về hoạt động CS chung.

## Gửi cái gì

**Self-guided puzzle or game ([example](https://code.org/dance))**

These activities are designed for students to self-direct through a tutorial. They don’t require much instruction from a teacher or teacher prep work.

**Teacher Facilitated lesson ([example](https://studio.code.org/s/course1/lessons/2/levels/1), [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DhaLNd6uim9rRPkHrglnOvVcgzGc8axKIzv8YI56JGA))**

Now that hundreds of thousands of educators have tried the Hour of Code, many classrooms are ready for more creative activities that teach the basics of computer science. To help more advanced teachers find inspiration, we collect and curate "teacher-led" lessons and activity plans for Hour of Code veterans.

Hiện nay có hàng nghìn nhà giáo dục đang thử nghiệm với Giờ học mã, nhiều lớp học đã sẵn sàng cho các hoạt động sáng tạo dạy về khoa học máy tính cơ bản. Để giúp cho những giáo viên tiên tiến tìm thấy động lực, chúng tôi đã thu thập và chọn ra những bài giảng do giáo viên giảng dạy và những kế hoach hoạt động cho các cựu chiến binh của Giờ học mã. If facilitated properly, more open-ended activities can better showcase the creative nature of computer science.

Some educators may also prefer to host Hour of Code activities that follow a traditional lesson format rather than a guided-puzzle/game experience.

You can start with this [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DhaLNd6uim9rRPkHrglnOvVcgzGc8axKIzv8YI56JGA) for your lesson plan.

**Activities for teachers in other subjects/fields**

We also feature lesson plans designed for different subject areas. For example, a one-hour lesson plan for teaching code in a geometry class. Or a mad-lib exercise for English class. Or a creative quiz-creation activity for history class. These can help recruit teachers in other subject areas to guide an Hour of Code activity that is unique to their field, while demonstrating how CS can influence and enhance many different subject areas.

Examples:

- Mirror Images (an activity for an art teacher)
- An arduino activity for a physics teacher
- A history of technology activity for a history teacher
- And see [this list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19jQ2VhBUyIn30VFbfdHOVpmlymhNiB0AkEqRxHz3dr0/edit) for more ideas from educators (or add your own to the list to inspire others)

**For students with special needs**

If you create an activity or tutorial that is designed for special needs students, please call that out in the description. In particular, there are very few options for the vision-impaired. If your activity is designed for this audience, please let us know.

## General guidelines for creating an Hour of Code activity

The goal of an Hour of Code is to give beginners an accessible first taste of computer science or programming. The tone should be that:

- Anybody can learn computer science - regardless of age, gender, race, or ability/disability. 
- Computer science is connected to a wide variety of fields and interests. Everybody should learn it!
- Encourage students to create something unique that can be shared with parents/friends or online. 

The activities should teach a computer science concept such as loops, conditionals, encryption, or how the Internet works. An activity can also teach about how computer science connects to real world occupations, events, or history. For example, teaching UX design to make apps that are meaningful for an audience or cause. We discourage activities that focus on the syntax of programming rather than the concepts. For example, we will list, but not highlight, activities that teach HTML. Similarly, we discourage block programming lessons that focus on setting/changing configuration options rather than learning how to model an algorithm or process.

*Technical requirements:* Because of the wide variety of school and classroom technology setups, the best activities are Web-based or smartphone-friendly, or otherwise unplugged-style activities that teach computer science concepts without the use of a computer (see <http://csunplugged.com/>). Activities that require an app-install, desktop app, or game-console experiences are okay but not ideal. We will not list activities that require sign up or payment. (Robotics activities can require robotics purchase.)

*Student-led (Self-Guided) Format:* The original Hour of Code was built mostly on the success of self-guided tutorials or lessons, optionally facilitated by the teacher. There are plenty of existing options, but if you want to create a new one, these activities should be designed so they can be fun for a student working alone, or in a classroom whose teacher has minimal prep or CS background. They should provide directions for students as opposed to an open-ended hour-long challenge. Ideally, the instructions and tutorials are integrated directly into the programming platform, to avoid switching tabs or windows between the tutorial and the programming platform.

To get a sense of the wide variety of types of tutorials and lesson plans you can create, visit the [Hour of Code Activities page](https://hourofcode.com/us/learn).

## Các hoạt động sẽ được đánh giá như thế nào

A diverse committee of computer science educators will rank submissions based on qualitative and quantitative criteria. All activities that fit the basic criteria will be listed. Teachers will be able to filter and sort to find the best activities for their classroom.

The rubric for evaluating activities and lesson plans will look for the following criteria on all activities and rank them accordingly:

- High production quality
- Promote learning by all demographic groups (esp. students underrepresented in CS, like young women, students from marginalized racial and ethnic groups, and students with disabilities)
- Educational (teaches computer science concepts well)
- Fun and engaging
- Encourages students to create something unique they can share (For younger students: with parents and classmates. For olders students: on the Internet)

If the review committee rates the activity a zero in production quality (due to bad bugs or instructions that make it very hard to use), in promoting learning in underrepresented groups (due to racist/sexist material), in educational value (does not teach CS concepts), or fun/engaging (due to being difficult/discouraging for students to work through), the activity will not be listed.

In addition, in order to be listed, all activities must:

- Be appropriate for a public school classroom (no guns, no explicit/mature content, no religious content, etc.)
- Require no sign up 
- Require no payment (exception for robotics activities these can require robot/kit purchase) For self-directed activities for new teachers and students the review committee will be looking for whether:
- Teachers can use the tutorial or activity with no background in computer science
- Students can be successful with no background in computer science
- Students can direct themselves through the tutorial without parental or teacher guidance

Teachers and students will be able to search through and filter our list of activities based on filters such as grade, experience level, subject, hardware, etc. By default, we will show lesson plans and activities first that:

- Receive the highest ratings from the review committee
- Are one hour self-directed activities designed for beginners (students and teachers)
- Appeal to a wide range of users (across platforms, languages, and ages)
- Require no installation
- Are new this year

<a id="earlyreview"></a>

## Những đề xuất để thiết kế hoạt động của bạn

Any activity submitted between April 30 and August 16 will receive a qualitative review from at least three members of the [Hour of Code Activity Review committee](/review-committee).

Reviewers will focus on providing the following:

* Positive feedback - What's working well?
* Critical feedback - What could be improved?
* Bugs or errors - Are there any bugs, syntax errors, or grammatical errors? If so, where in the activity?
* Does this activity encourage students to create something unique?

Please note: These are the general guidelines for providing feedback. The early review of your activity may include feedback across all of these categories, or it may only include feedback in one or two. There is also **no guarantee that we will catch all bugs or issues in an activity**.

**The early review is not an opportunity to collect feedback on an unfinished activity. Any activity a reviewer deems too incomplete to assess will not be reviewed.**

All activities submitted for early review will receive feedback by September 1st. We will also provide a link to a form you can use to explain specific changes made to an activity in response to feedback.

Every activity submitted before October 1st will receive a standard review, whether it receives an early review or not. During the standard review period (September-October), reviewers will focus on rating the activities according to the criteria described in the "How activities will be evaluated" section above. Unless you note specific changes to an activity, reviewers can and likely will rely on early review feedback to rate activities.

## Nguyên tắc nhãn hiệu

You can include the [Hour of Code logo](https://hourofcode.com/us/promote/resources#logo) in your tutorial, but this is not required. If you use the Hour of Code logo, see the trademark guidelines below. <u>Under no circumstances can the Code.org logo and name be used.</u> Both are trademarked, and can’t be co-mingled with a 3rd party brand name without express written permission.

**Make sure that the average student can finish comfortably in an hour.** Consider adding an open-ended activity at the end for students who move more quickly through the lesson. Remember that most kids will be absolute beginners to computer science and coding.

**Include teacher notes.** Most activities should be student-directed, but if an activity is facilitated or managed by a teacher, please include clear and simple directions for the teacher in the form of teacher-notes at a separate URL submitted with your activity. Not only are the students novices, some of the teachers are as well. Include info such as:

- What platforms and browsers does the tutorial work best on?
- Does it work on smartphones? Tablets?
- Do you recommend pair programming? 
- Considerations for use in a classroom? E.g. if there are videos, advise teachers to show the videos on a projected screen for the entire classroom to view together

**Incorporate feedback at the end of the activity.** (E.g. “You finished 10 levels and learned about loops! Great job!”)

**Encourage students to post to social media (where appropriate) when they've finished.** For example “I’ve done an Hour of Code with ________ Have you? #HourOfCode” or “I’ve done an #HourOfCode as a part of #CSEdWeek. Have you? @Scratch.” Use the hashtag **#HourOfCode** (with capital letters H, O, C)

**Create your activity in Spanish or in other languages besides English.**

**Explain or connect the activity to a socially significant context.** Computer programming becomes a superpower when students see how it can change the world for the better!

**Make sure your tutorial can be used in a [Pair Programming](http://www.ncwit.org/resources/pair-programming-box-power-collaborative-learning) paradigm.** This is particularly useful for the Hour of Code because many classrooms do not have 1:1 hardware for all students.

## Theo dõi Pixel

Many of our tutorial partners have used our trademark "Hour of Code" on their web sites. We don't want to prevent this usage, but we want to make sure usage falls within a few limits:

1. Any reference to "Hour of Code" should be used in a fashion that doesn't suggest that it's your own brand name, but that it rather references the Hour of Code as a grassroots movement. Good example: "Participate in the Hour of Code™ at ACMECorp.com". Bad example: "Try Hour of Code by ACME Corp".
2. Use a "TM" superscript in the most prominent places you mention "Hour of Code", both on your web site and in app descriptions.
3. Include language on the page (or in the the footer), including links to the Hour of Code, CSEdWeek and Code.org web sites, that says the following: a. “The '[Hour of Code](http://hourofcode.com)™' is a nationwide initiative by [Computer Science Education Week](http://csedweek.org) and [Code.org](http://code.org) to introduce millions of students to one hour of computer science and computer programming.”
4. Không sử dụng "Hour of Code" trong tên ứng dụng.

## Thúc đẩy hoạt động của bạn, CSEdWeek, và Giờ học mật mã

In order to more accurately track participation we ask every tutorial partner to include a 1-pixel tracking image on the first page of their Hour of Code tutorials. The pixel-image must be on the start page only. Do not include on any interim pages of your tutorial.

This will allow us to count users who do your Hour of Code tutorial. It will lead to more accurate participation counts for your tutorial.

If your tutorial is approved and included on the final tutorial page, Code.org will provide you with a unique tracking pixel for you to integrate into your tutorial. See example below.

NOTE: this isn't important to do for installable apps (iOS/Android apps, or desktop-install apps)

Example tracking pixels for Dance Party:

<a id="promote"></a>

## Promoting your activities, CSEdWeek, and Hour of Code

Please promote your activity to your network! Direct them to your Hour of Code page. Your users are much more likely to react to a mailing from you about your activity. Use the international Hour of Code campaign during Computer Science Education Week as an excuse to encourage users to invite others to join in, and help us reach more students!

- Feature Hour of Code and CSEdWeek on your website. Ex: <http://www.tynker.com/hour-of-code>
- Promote Hour of Code using social media, traditional media, mailing lists, etc, using hashtag #HourOfCode (with capital letters H, O, C)
- Host a local event or ask your employees to host an event at local schools or community groups.
- See our [resource kit](https://hourofcode.com/us/promote) for further information.
