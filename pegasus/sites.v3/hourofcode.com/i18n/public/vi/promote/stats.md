## Sử dụng đoạn giới thiệu ngắn trong bản tin

#### Bring computer science to your school. Start with an Hour of Code!

With technology changing every industry on the planet, computing knowledge has become part of a well-rounded skill set. Nhưng ít hơn một nửa của tất cả các trường giảng dạy môn khoa học máy tính! Tin tốt là chúng tôi đang trên đường thay đổi điều đó. Nếu bạn đã nghe về Hour of Code năm ngoái, bạn có thể biết nó đã làm nên lịch sử. Có 100 triệu học sinh hiện nay đã phát hiện ra cách để truy cập và niềm vui trong khoa học máy tính bằng một giờ học lập trình.

Hour of Code (Giờ lập trình) là một giờ giới thiệu về khoa học máy tính, được thiết kế để đơn giản hóa với mục đích để mọi người đều có thể học những điều cơ bản. Learn more at [http://HourOfCode.com](http://HourofCode.com), try an hour yourself, or host an Hour of Code event to introduce others to the world of computing!

## Messaging for frequently asked questions

#### Why is your school doing an Hour of Code?

While all of us know that it’s important for students to learn how to navigate today’s tech-saturated world, many teachers aren’t experienced in computer science and don’t know where to start. This event is a chance for all of us to see what computer science is about.

We hope it’ll spark interest in students to keep learning. Research also shows that kids can pick up programming concepts before they know how to read and write. In fact, their brains are more receptive to computer languages at a young age, just like foreign languages. <br /> <br />

#### Why is this important?

Technology is transforming every industry on the planet. In 2015, 7 million openings in the U.S. were in occupations—including art and design—that value coding skills. But 65 percent of schools in the U.S. don't teach computer science. It’s time for us to catch up to the 21st century. We know that regardless of what our students do when they grow up, whether they go into medicine, business, politics, or the arts, knowing how to build technology will give them confidence and a competitive edge. <br /> <br />

#### A quote you can use in materials

"The Hour of Code is designed to demystify code and show that computer science is not rocket science—anybody can learn the basics," said Hadi Partovi, founder and CEO of Code.org. "Over 100 million students worldwide have tried an Hour of Code. The demand for relevant 21st-century computer science education crosses all borders and knows no boundaries." <br /> <br />

#### About Code.org

Code.org is a 501c3 public non-profit dedicated to expanding participation in computer science and increasing participation by women and underrepresented students of color. Its vision is that every student in every school has the opportunity to learn computer programming. After launching in 2013, Code.org organized the Hour of Code campaign – which has introduced over 100 million students to computer science to date – and partnered with 70 public school districts nationwide to expand computer science programs. Code.org is supported by philanthropic donations from corporations, foundations and generous individuals, including Microsoft, Facebook, Infosys Foundation USA, Amazon, and others.
