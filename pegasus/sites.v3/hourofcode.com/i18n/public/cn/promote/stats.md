### 以编程一小时开启你学校的计算机科学

计算机无处不在，但是和10年前相比，教计算机科学的学校却更少了。 好消息是，我们正在着手改变现状。 If you heard about the [Hour of Code](<%= resolve_url('/') %>) last year, you might know it made history. In the first Hour of Code, 15 million students tried computer science. Last year, that number increased to 60 million students! The [Hour of Code](<%= resolve_url('/') %>) is a one-hour introduction to computer science, designed to demystify code and show that anybody can learn the basics. [Sign up](<%= resolve_url('/') %>) to host an Hour of Code this <%= campaign_date('full') %> during Computer Science Education Week.
