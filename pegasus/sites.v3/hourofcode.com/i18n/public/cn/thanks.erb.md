# 感谢注册并组织编程一小时活动！

<br /> **The Hour of Code runs during <%= campaign_date('full') %> and we'll be in touch about new tutorials and other exciting updates as they come out. In the meantime, what can you do now?**

## 1. 在您的学校和社区传播这个信息

You just joined the Hour of Code movement. Tell your friends with **#HourOfCode**!

<%= view :share_buttons, facebook:facebook, twitter:twitter %> <br /> Encourage others to participate [with our sample emails.](<%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#sample-emails') %>) Contact your principal and challenge every classroom at your school to sign up. Recruit a local group — boy/girl scouts club, church, university, veterans group, labor union, or even some friends. 你不必在学校学习新的技能。 Invite a local politician or policy maker to visit your school for the Hour of Code. 它能为你在你领域的计算机科学找到一小时之外的支持。

为你的活动使用这些[海报、 横幅、 贴纸、 视频以及更多](<%= resolve_url('/promote/resources') %>)。

## 2. 找当地的志愿者来帮助你的活动

[Search our volunteer map](<%= codeorg_url('/volunteer/local') %>) for volunteers who can visit your classroom or video chat remotely to inspire your students about the breadth of possibilities with computer science.

## 3. 计划您的《编程一小时》

Choose an [Hour of Code activity](https://hourofcode.com/learn) for your classroom and [review this how-to guide](<%= resolve_url('/how-to') %>).

# 《编程一小时》以外的更多内容

<% if @country == 'us' %> 《编程一小时》只是一个开始。 Whether you are an administrator, teacher, or advocate, we have [professional development, curriculum, and resources to help you bring computer science classes to your school or expand your offerings.](https://code.org/yourschool) If you already teach computer science, use these resources during CS Education Week to rally support from your administration, parents, and community.

You have many choices to fit your school. Most of the organizations offering Hour of Code tutorials also have curriculum and professional development available. If you find a lesson you like, ask about going further. To help you get started, we've highlighted a number of [curriculum providers that will help you or your students go beyond an hour.](https://hourofcode.com/beyond)
