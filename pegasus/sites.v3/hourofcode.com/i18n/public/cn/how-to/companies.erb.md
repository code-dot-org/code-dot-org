# 如何将编程一小时带到您的公司

### Find out how you and your employees can inspire students to try computer science!

---

## Connect with local classrooms and volunteer for the Hour of Code

Code.org 可以为你的员工提供一些与当地参与编程一小时活动、且可以分享自己教学经验和如何激励学生学习计算机科学的[教学机构](<%= codeorg_url('/volunteer') %>)对接的机会。

[<button>Sign up to volunteer!</button>](<%= codeorg_url('/volunteer') %>) <br /> <br />

For more instructions on encouraging employees and connecting your employees with classrooms, check out our [guide for corporate partners](<%= localized_file('/files/hoc-corporate-toolkit.pdf') %>).

## Additional ways companies can support the Hour of Code

- Ask your CEO to [send a company-wide email](<%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#sample-emails') %>) emphasizing the importance of computer science and encouraging employees to spread the word.
- Host an Hour of Code Happy Hour with coworkers to try the [activities](<%= resolve_url('/learn') %>).
- Host an Hour of Code event for a local classroom of students or non profits partners to do an Hour of Code at your company’s office. See event how-to guide below.

# 如何和学生一起来举办编程一小时的活动

## 1. 推广你的编程一小时活动

- Promote your [Hour of Code](<%= resolve_url('/promote') %>) event and encourage others to host.
- Encourage software engineers at your company to visit a local classroom to help lead an Hour of Code and inspire students to study computer science. They can [sign up](<%= codeorg_url('/volunteer/engineer') %>) to be connected with a classroom.

## 2. 观看视频指导 <iframe width="500" height="255" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/SrnvvWDm73k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen mark="crwd-mark"></iframe> 

## 3. 选择一个活动

We host a variety of [fun, hour-long activities](<%= resolve_url('/learn') %>) for participants of all ages, created by a variety of partners. [点击这里试一试！](<%= resolve_url('/learn') %>)

**All Hour of Code activities** require minimal prep-time, and are self-guided - allowing participants to work at their own pace and skill-level.

## 4. 您所需的教学设备——电脑不是必需的

要获得编程一小时活动的最佳体验，需要一台联网的电脑。 But you **don’t** need a computer for every participant, and you can even do the Hour of Code without a computer at all.

**Plan Ahead!** Do the following before your event starts:

- Test activities on computers or devices. Make sure they work properly on browsers with sound and video.
- Provide headphones, or ask participants to bring their own, if the activity you choose works best with sound.
- **电脑不够？**采取[搭档合作编程](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q)的方式。 When participants partner up, they help each other and rely less on the organizer. 他们将明白编程也是一种社交和协作。
- **Have low bandwidth?** Plan to show videos at the front of the event, so each participant isn't downloading their own videos. Or try the unplugged / offline activities.

## 播放一段激励人心的视频来开始你的编程一小时。

讨论计算机科学对我们生活的各个方面的影响，鼓舞参与者，启动编程一小时活动 Share more about what inspired you to pursue computer science and your role at your company.

**播放鼓舞人心的视频：**

- Code.org 推出比尔·盖茨，马克·扎克伯格，NBA球星克里斯·波什为主演的视频（它们的长度分别为[1分钟](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYZF6oIZtfc)，[5分钟](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc)，和[9分钟](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1xS07N-FA)。）
- [全球 编程一小时活动 视频 ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsOIlDT145A)
- [总统奥巴马号召所有学生学习计算机科学](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvmhE1J9PY)。
- 更多励志的视频可以[ 点此查看](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNfpD8i4Sx7U0y2MccnrNZuP)。

**Ideas to introduce your Hour of Code activity to students:**

- Explain ways technology impacts our lives, with examples both boys and girls will care about - talk about technology that’s saving lives, helping people, connecting people.
- If you are a tech company, demo fun, innovative products your company is working on.
- If you aren’t a tech company, discuss ways your company uses technology to solve problems and accomplish goals.
- Invite software engineers from your company to speak about why they decided to study computer science and the projects they work on.

## 6. 编程！

**在活动中指导参与者**

- Write the activity link on a whiteboard. Find the link listed on the [information for your selected activity](<%= resolve_url('/learn') %>) under the number of participants.
- For younger students, load the activity page ahead of time or save it as a bookmark.

**When participants come across difficulties it's okay to respond:**

- "我也不知道。让我们一起来找到问题的答案吧"。
- “学习编程就像是学习一门新的语言（事实上就是-我们一直都将学习编程称作学习编程语言，你现在学的这种叫Blocky?）；你不会马上就说得很流利。”

**如果某些学生完成得比较快可以怎样做？**

- They can try another Hour of Code activity at hourofcode.com/learn.
- Or, ask them to help a friend who are having trouble with the activity.

## 7) 庆祝

- [Print certificates](<%= codeorg_url('/certificates') %>) for participants and students.
- [Print "I did an Hour of Code!"](<%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#stickers') %>) stickers.
- [Order custom t-shirts](http://blog.code.org/post/132608499493/hour-of-code-shirts-and-more) for your employees.
