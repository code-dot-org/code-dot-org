# How to plan your Hour of Code

### 参与活动，并用下面的步骤向学生们介绍他们第一个小时的计算机科学。 编程一小时的课程哪怕是对初学者来说都非常容易上手！ If you'd like an extra set of hands to help out, you can find a [local volunteer]({{ urls/volunteer_local }}) to help run an Hour of Code in your class.

### Take a look at our [participation guide if you still have questions]({{ localized_files/participation_guide }}).

## 1. Watch this how-to video <iframe width="500" height="255" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/SrnvvWDm73k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen mark="crwd-mark"></iframe>

## 2. Explore Activities and Tutorials

We provide a variety of fun, [student-guided tutorials]({{ urls/learn }}) for all age groups and experience levels. It’s popular for students to try self-led tutorials, though many activities include lesson plans for teachers to guide discussion or extend the activity as well.

Explore the activities and decide ahead of time if you want to choose a single tutorial for all of your students, or let each child pick their own.

## 3. Create your Plan for the Day

### Think about your technology needs - computers are optional!

- 要获得编程一小时活动的最佳体验，需要一台联网的电脑。 But you don’t need a computer for every child, and you can even do the Hour of Code without a computer at all! For [unplugged activities](/learn), simply filter the Classroom Technology section to show options for “No computers or devices”.
- 在学生计算机或设备上测试这些指南，确保它们在播放器上的声音和视频能够正常运作。 Have low bandwidth? Plan to show videos at the front of the class, so each student isn't downloading their own videos. Or try the offline tutorials.
- 如果教程包含音频，那么应提前准备耳机，或者让学生自带耳机。
- Don't have enough devices? Use [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q). 学生之间搭档之后，他们会互相帮助并减少对老师的依赖。 他们将明白编程也是一种社交和协作。

### Pick a day and time

People around the world join in the Hour of Code celebration during CS Education Week (December 9-13) when the latest tutorials and activities are released. But you can do an Hour of Code any day of the year!

## 4. Promote your Hour of Code

Now that you've planned your event, it's time to start promoting it!

### Tell your School and Community

Promote the Hour of Code to other teachers who may want to join in on the fun! This is also a great opportunity to reach out to your school’s PTSA or share in parent newsletters, letting them know their children may come home wanting to try more activities and tutorials!

### Let Volunteers Know by Registering Your Event

When you [sign-up your Hour of Code event](/), you’ll receive helpful email communications with news and tips for hosting a successful Hour of Code. It’s also how you can let local volunteers know your school is participating. Volunteers are a great resource and can come speak to your class about computer science or simply help your students with Hour of Code activities.

### Get your Students Excited

Lead up to the event by sharing [inspirational videos](/promote/resources) highlighting diverse people and creative ways that computer science can be used. Or order inspirational posters for your classroom! Students are more excited to participate in a subject when they see people who look like them encouraging it.

## 5. Start your Hour of Code Strong

Once your Hour of Code celebration has arrived, make sure you start your event strong with some of these tools and tips.

Invite a [local volunteer]({{ urls/volunteer_local }}) to inspire your students by talking about the breadth of possibilities in computer science. There are thousands of volunteers around the world ready to help with your Hour of Code through either a classroom visit or video chat with your students!

播放鼓舞人心的视频：

- 正版的 Code.org 推出包括比尔盖茨、马克·扎克伯格和 NBA 球星克里斯. 波什的视频。 （有[1 分钟的](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYZF6oIZtfc)，[5 分钟的](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc)和[9 分钟的](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1xS07N-FA)）
- Find more inspirational [resources]({{ urls/inspire }}) and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNfpD8i4Sx7U0y2MccnrNZuP).

It’s okay if both you and your students are brand new to computer science. Here are some ideas to introduce your Hour of Code activity:

- 通过男孩和女孩们都关心的例子，介绍科技如何影响我们的生活（比如拯救生命，帮助人们，连接人们等）
- 让全班一起来列出每天生活中用到编程的地方。
- See tips for getting girls interested in computer science [here]({{ urls/girls }}).


## 6. Get Coding!

Direct students to the activity

- Write the tutorial link on a whiteboard. Find the link listed on the [information for your selected tutorial]({{ urls/learn }}) under the number of participants.

When your students come across difficulties it's okay to respond:

- “I don’t know. Let’s figure this out together.”
- “科学技术并不总是同我们期望的方式一样工作。”
- “学习编程就像是学习一门新的语言（事实上就是-我们一直都将学习编程称作学习编程语言，你现在学的这种叫Blocky?）；你不会马上就说得很流利。”

What if a student finishes early?

- Students can see all tutorials and [try another Hour of Code activity]({{ urls/learn }}).
- 或者可以让提早完成的学生去帮助那些在活动中遇到困难的同学。
