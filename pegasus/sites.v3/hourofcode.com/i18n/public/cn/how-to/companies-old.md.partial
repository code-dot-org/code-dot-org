# 如何将编程一小时带到您的公司
### Find out how you and your employees can inspire students to try computer science!

***

## Connect with local classrooms and volunteer for the Hour of Code
Code.org offers the opportunity for your employees to [connect]({{ urls/volunteer }}) with local classrooms doing the Hour of Code where they can share their tech career experience and inspire students to study computer science.

[<button>Sign up to volunteer!</button>]({{ urls/volunteer }})

For more instructions on encouraging employees and connecting your employees with classrooms, check out our [guide for corporate partners]({{ localized_files/hoc_corporate_toolkit }}).

## Additional ways companies can support the Hour of Code

- Ask your CEO to [send a company-wide email]({{ promote/sample_emails }}) emphasizing the importance of computer science and encouraging employees to spread the word.
- Host an Hour of Code Happy Hour with coworkers to try the [activities]({{ urls/learn }}).
- Host an Hour of Code event for a local classroom of students or non profits partners to do an Hour of Code at your company’s office. See event how-to guide below.


# 如何和学生一起来举办编程一小时的活动

## 1. Promote your Hour of Code
- Promote your [Hour of Code]({{ urls/promote }}) event and encourage others to host.
- Encourage software engineers at your company to visit a local classroom to help lead an Hour of Code and inspire students to study computer science. They can [sign up]({{ urls/volunteer_engineer }}) to be connected with a classroom.

## 3. Choose an activity
We host a variety of [fun, hour-long activities]({{ urls/learn }}) for participants of all ages, created by a variety of partners. [Try them out!]({{ urls/learn }})

**All Hour of Code activities** require minimal prep-time, and are self-guided - allowing participants to work at their own pace and skill-level.

## 4. Plan your technology needs - computers are optional

要获得编程一小时活动的最佳体验，需要一台联网的电脑。 But you **don’t** need a computer for every participant, and you can even do the Hour of Code without a computer at all.

**Plan Ahead!** Do the following before your event starts:

- Test activities on computers or devices. Make sure they work properly on browsers with sound and video.
- 如果所选课程需要配合声音才能获得最佳效果，请在活动中提供耳机，或要求参与者自带。
- **Don't have enough devices?** Use [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q). 搭档合作可以让参与者互相帮助，减少对组织者的依赖。 他们将明白编程也是一种社交和协作。
- **Have low bandwidth?** Plan to show videos at the front of the event, so each participant isn't downloading their own videos. Or try the unplugged / offline activities.

## 5.  Start your Hour of Code off with an inspiring video
通过鼓励参与者、组织关于计算机如何影响生活的讨论来引入“编程一小时”课程。 亦可分享那些激励你探索计算机科学的故事，或者你在公司中担任的角色。

**播放鼓舞人心的视频：**

- Code.org 推出比尔·盖茨，马克·扎克伯格，NBA球星克里斯·波什为主演的视频（它们的长度分别为[1分钟](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYZF6oIZtfc)，[5分钟](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc)，和[9分钟](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1xS07N-FA)。）
- [全球 编程一小时活动 视频 ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsOIlDT145A)
- [总统奥巴马号召所有学生学习计算机科学](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvmhE1J9PY)。
- 更多励志的视频可以[ 点此查看](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNfpD8i4Sx7U0y2MccnrNZuP)。

**Ideas to introduce your Hour of Code activity to students:**

- Explain ways technology impacts our lives, with examples both boys and girls will care about - talk about technology that’s saving lives, helping people, connecting people.
- If you are a tech company, demo fun, innovative products your company is working on.
- If you aren’t a tech company, discuss ways your company uses technology to solve problems and accomplish goals.
- Invite software engineers from your company to speak about why they decided to study computer science and the projects they work on.
- See tips for getting girls interested in computer science [here]({{ urls/girls }}).

## 6. Code!
**在活动中指导参与者**

- Write the activity link on a whiteboard. Find the link listed on the [information for your selected activity]({{ urls/learn }}) under the number of participants.
- For younger students, load the activity page ahead of time or save it as a bookmark.

**When participants come across difficulties it's okay to respond:**

- “I don’t know. Let’s figure this out together.”
- “学习编程就像是学习一门新的语言（事实上就是-我们一直都将学习编程称作学习编程语言，你现在学的这种叫Blocky?）；你不会马上就说得很流利。”

**如果某些学生完成得比较快可以怎样做？**

- They can try another Hour of Code activity at hourofcode.com/learn.
- Or, ask them to help a friend who are having trouble with the activity.

## 7) 庆祝

- [Print certificates]({{ urls/certificates }}) for participants and students.
- [Print "I did an Hour of Code!"]({{ promote/resources_stickers }}) stickers.
- 为员工[定制T恤](http://blog.code.org/post/132608499493/hour-of-code-shirts-and-more)。
- Share photos and videos of your Hour of Code event on social media. Use #HourOfCode and @codeorg so we can highlight your success, too!
