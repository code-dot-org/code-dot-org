## 需要整个学校参加才能获得10000美元的硬件奖励吗？

Yes. Your whole school has to participate to be eligible for the prize but only one person needs to register and submit the Hardware Prize application form [here](<%= resolve_url('/prizes/hardware-signup') %>). Every teacher participating will need to [sign up](<%= resolve_url('/') %>) their classroom individually in order to receive the all organizer thank you gift.

## Who is eligible to win the $10,000 in hardware?

该奖品仅限于美国K-12学校。 To qualify, your entire school must register for the Hour of Code by November 16, 2015. 在美国各州都将有一所学校收到我们为其班级配备的电脑。 Code.org will select and notify winners via email by December 1, 2015.

## 为什么只有公立学校可以获得10000美元硬件奖励？

We would love to help teachers in public and private schools alike, but at this time, it comes down to logistics. We have partnered with [DonorsChoose.org](http://donorschoose.org) to administer classroom funding prizes, which only works with public, US K-12 schools. According to DonorsChoose.org, the organization is better able to access consistent and accurate data that's available for public schools.

## 申请硬件奖励的截止日期是什么时间？

To qualify, you must complete the [Hardware Application form](<%= resolve_url('/prizes/hardware-signup') %>) by November 16, 2015. 在美国各州都将有一所学校收到我们为其班级配备的电脑。 Code.org will select and notify winners via email by December 1, 2015.

## If my whole school can’t do the Hour of Code during Computer Science Education Week (<%= campaign_date('short') %>), can I still qualify for prizes?

Yes, in the [Hardware Application form](<%= resolve_url('/prizes/hardware-signup') %>) include the dates that your whole school is participating.

<% end %>

## 我是在美国以外，我可以有资格获奖吗？

Yes, all organizers, both US and non-US, are eligible to receive the all organizer thank-you gift. The $10K hardware prize is US only.
