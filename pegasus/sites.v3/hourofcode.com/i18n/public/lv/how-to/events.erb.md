# How to organize an Hour of Code assembly or event

### Get your entire school or community involved in an Hour of Code!

---

## 1. Prepare for your event

- Determine a venue, date, and time.
- Send [a letter](https://hourofcode.com/promote/resources#sample-emails) to your local mayor, member of Congress, governor, or influential business person and invite them to speak. Check out our [how-to toolkit](<%=localized_file('/files/elected-official.pdf')%>) when hosting an elected official during an Hour of Code for more info.
- Ielūdziet medijus, piemēram, vietējo ziņu raidījumu, avīžu vai tehnoloģiju žurnālistus. Apskati mūsu [sagatavotos materiālus](<%= hoc_uri('/resources/press-kit') %>).

## 2. During your event

- Kick off your event with one of our [inspirational videos](<%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#videos') %>).
- Sniedz nelielu ievadu par datorzinātņu nozīmi, izmantojot vienu no šiem [infografikiem](<%= hoc_uri('/resources/stats') %>).   
      
    
- **Other event ideas**: 
    - Invite a local industry leader to discuss his or her work involving computer science.
    - Invite a local politician and have students teach him or her how to code.
    - Have a group of students demonstrate an unplugged activity.
    - Have a group of students teach the principal or a group of teachers how to code.
    - If your school already teaches computer science, have students demo projects.

## 3. Share how it went

Share pictures of your event on Facebook and Twitter and use the hashtag **#HourOfCode**.

## Host a Family Code Night with the Hour of Code and invite parents to participate

Consider hosting a K-5 evening event and invite parents to join their students for an hour of computer science. This is a great way to engage the larger community and encourage parent support for computer science at your school. Our partners at Family Code Night have created an all-in-one event kit with planning checklist, presenter’s script, invitation emails, posters, powerpoints, and more to run your own event. [Click here to download the Event Kit](http://www.familycodenight.org/DownloadCodeDotOrg.html).
