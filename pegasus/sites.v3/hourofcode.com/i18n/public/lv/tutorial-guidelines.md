# Tutorial guidelines for the Hour of Code™ and Computer Science Education Week

Code.org will host a variety of Hour of Code™ activities on the Code.org, Hour of Code, and CSEdWeek website(s). The current list is at [<%= resolve_url('code.org/learn') %>](<%= resolve_url('https://code.org/learn') %>).

We’d like to host a variety of engaging options, but the primary goal is to optimize the experience for students and teachers who are new to computer science. Please use this document to guide the creation of your activity, targeted to the user who has no background in coding, computer programming, and computer science.

  


**After reading the guidelines, you can submit your tutorial through our [Hour of Code™ Activity Submission page](https://goo.gl/kNrV3l).**

**NEW:** Unlike past years, we plan to introduce a new format for "teacher-led" Hour of Code activities. These will be listed below the self-guided activities in student-facing pages and emails. Details below.

## New for 2015: two formats of activities: self-guided or *lesson-plan*

Now that tens of thousands of educators have tried the Hour of Code, many classrooms are ready for more creative, less one-size-fits-all activities that teach the basics of computer science. To help teachers find inspiration, we'd like to collect and curate one-hour "Teacher-Led" lesson and activity plans for Hour of Code veterans. We will continue promoting the "Self-guided" format as well.

**Submit a Teacher-Led Lesson Plan, ideally for different subject areas *(NEW)***: Do you have an engaging or unique idea for an Hour of Code lesson? Some educators may prefer to host Hour of Code activities that follow a traditional lesson format rather than a guided-puzzle/game experience. If facilitated properly, more open-ended activities can better showcase the creative nature of computer science. We would love to collect **one-hour lesson plans designed for different subject areas**. For example, a one-hour lesson plan for teaching code in a geometry class. Or a mad-lib exercise for English class. Or a creative quiz-creation activity for history class. This can help recruit teachers in other subject areas to guide an Hour of Code activity that is unique to their field, while demonstrating how CS can influence and enhance many different subject areas.

You can start with this [empty template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zyD4H6qs7K67lUN2lVX0ewd8CgMyknD2N893EKsLWTg/pub) for your lesson plan.

Examples:

  * [Mirror Images (an activity for an art teacher)](https://csedweek.org/csteacher/mirrorimages.pdf)
  * [An arduino activity for a physics teacher](https://csedweek.org/csteacher/arduino.pdf)
  * [A history of technology activity for a history teacher](https://csedweek.org/csteacher/besttechnology.pdf)

[<button>How can I submit my own lesson plan?</button>](#submit)

  
  
**Student-led (Self-Guided) Format**: The original Hour of Code was built mostly on the success of self-guided tutorials or lessons, optionally facilitated by the teacher. There are plenty of existing options, but if you want to create a new one, these activities should be designed so they can be fun for a student working alone, or in a classroom whose teacher has minimal prep or CS background. They should provide directions for students as opposed to an open-ended hour-long challenge. Ideally, the instructions and tutorials are integrated directly into the programming platform, to avoid switching tabs or windows between the tutorial and the programming platform.

Note: On student-facing pages we'll list teacher-led activities *below* the self-guided ones, but we'll specifically call them out on pages or emails meant for educators.

## Vispārējās vadlīnijas, lai izveidotu "Programmēšanas stundas" aktivitātes

The goal of an Hour of Code is to give beginners an accessible first taste of computer science or programming (not HTML). The tone should be that:

  * Computer science is not just for geniuses, regardless of age, gender, race. Anybody *can* learn!
  * Computer science is connected to a wide variety of fields and interests. Everybody *should* learn!
  * Mudināt skolēnus radīt kaut ko ar ko varētu dalīties ar draugiem un tiešsaistē esošiem cilvēkiem.

**Technical requirements**: Because of the wide variety of school and classroom technology setups, the best activities are Web-based or smartphone-friendly, or otherwise unplugged-style activities that teach computer science concepts without the use of a computer (see <http://csunplugged.com/>). Activities that require an app-install, desktop app, or game-console experiences are ok but not ideal.

## Kā apmācibas tiks novērtētas

A committee of computer science educators will rank submissions based on qualitative and quantitative metrics, including survey results from a broader set of educators.

**Tutorials will be listed higher if they are:**

  * augstas kvalitātes
  * designed for beginners - among students AND teachers
  * izveidota kā mazāk kā aptuveni vienas stundas aktivitāte
  * require no sign up
  * require no payment
  * require no installation
  * Platformneatkarīgs, ieskaitot mobilos tālruņus un planšetes
  * strādā vairākās valodās
  * promote learning by all demographic groups (esp. under-represented groups)
  * Ne tikai HTML un CSS web dizaina fokuss ( mūsu mērķis ir datorzinātne ne tikai HTML programmēšana)

**Tutorials will be listed lower if they are:**

  * zemas kvalitātes
  * mācīs augstākā līmenī (nebūs piemērota iesācējiem)
  * platformatkarīgs - web bāzēm būtu jāpiemēro tālāk minētie nosacījumi: IE9+ un jaunākā Chrome, Firefox un Safari versija
  * strādātu tikai angļu valodā
  * reinforce stereotypes that hinder participation by under-represented student groups
  * kalpo kā reklāma maksas apmācības platformai

**Tutorials will NOT be listed if they:**

  * nav paredzēti (aptuveni) vienas stundas nodarbībai
  * nepieciešams reģistrēties 
  * ir maksas
  * require installation (other than mobile apps)
  * koncentrējas tikai uz HTML + CSS web dizainu
  * tiek iesniegti pēc iesniegšanas termiņa beigām vai ar nepilnīgu informāciju (skat. zemāk)

**If your tutorial is student-led** Student-led tutorials need to be designed to be self-directed, not to require significant CS instruction or prep from teachers

Ultimately, the goal of the Hour of Code campaign is to broaden participation in computer science by students and teachers, and to help show that computer science is accessible to all, and “easier than you think.” In many ways, this goal is better achieved by giving students and teachers fewer and simpler choices, with a focus on the highest quality options for a first-time user. Note also that the 2013 and 2014 Hour of Code campaigns were a fantastic success with over 120M served, with nearly unanimous positive survey responses from participating teachers and students. As a result, the existing listings are certainly good and the driving reason to add tutorials to the Hour of Code listings isn't to broaden the choices, but to continue to raise the quality (or freshness) for students, or to expand the options for non-English speakers given the global nature of the 2015 campaign.

## Ieteikumi, lai konstruētu jūsu darbības

You can include either the CSEdWeek logo ([small](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ojlltuegr7ruvx1/csedweek-logo-final-small.jpg) or [big](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yolheibpxapzpp1/csedweek-logo-final-big.png)) or the [Hour of Code logo](https://www.dropbox.com/work/Marketing/HOC2014/Logos%202014/HOC%20Logos) in your tutorial, but this is not required. If you use the Hour of Code logo, see the trademark guidelines below. Under no circumstances can the Code.org logo and name be used. Both are trademarked, and can’t be co-mingled with a 3rd party brand name without express written permission.

**Make sure that the average student can finish comfortably in an hour.** Consider adding an open-ended activity at the end for students who move more quickly through the lesson. Remember that most kids will be absolute beginners to computer science and coding.

**Include teacher notes.** Most activities should be student-directed, but if an activity is facilitated or managed by a teacher, please include clear and simple directions for the teacher in the form of teacher-notes at a separate URL submitted with your activity. Not only are the students novices, some of the teachers are as well. Include info such as:

  * Our tutorial works best on the following platforms and browsers
  * Does it work on smartphones? Tablets?
  * Do you recommend pair programming? 
  * Considerations for use in a classroom? E.g. if there are videos, advise teachers to show the videos on a projected screen for the entire classroom to view together

**Incorporate feedback at the end of the activity.** (E.g.: “You finished 10 levels and learned about loops! Great job!”)

**Encourage students to post to social media (where appropriate) when they've finished.** For example “I’ve done an Hour of Code with ________ Have you? #HourOfCode” or “I’ve done an #HourofCode as a part of #CSEdWeek. Have you? @Scratch.” Use the hashtag **#HourOfCode** (with capital letters H, O, C)

**Create your activity in Spanish or in other languages besides English.** ]

**Explain or connect the activity to a socially significant context.** Computer programming becomes a superpower when students see how it can change the world for the better!

**Do not require signup or payment before students can try your tutorial.** Tutorials that require signup or payment will not be listed

**Make sure your tutorial can be used in a [Pair Programming](http://www.ncwit.org/resources/pair-programming-box-power-collaborative-learning) paradigm.** The three rules of pair programming in a school setting are:

  * The driver controls the mouse and keyboard.
  * The Navigator makes suggestions, points out errors, and asks questions. 
  * Students should switch roles at least two times a session.

Benefits of Pair Programming:

  * Students can help one another instead of relying on the teacher
  * Show that coding is not a solo activity, but one involving social interaction
  * Not all classrooms or labs have enough computers for a 1:1 experience

## Preču zīmes vadlīnijas

After the success of the 2013 campaign, we took steps to make sure we set up the Hour of Code as a movement that can repeat annually with greater fidelity and without confusion.

One piece of this is to protect the trademark "Hour of Code" to prevent confusion. Many of our tutorial partners have used "Hour of Code" on your web sites. We don't want to prevent this usage, but we want to make sure it fits within a few limits:

  1. Any reference to "Hour of Code" should be used in a fashion that doesn't suggest that it's your own brand name, but rather referencing the Hour of Code as a grassroots movement. Good example: "Participate in the Hour of Code™ at ACMECorp.com". Bad example: "Try Hour of Code by ACME Corp".
  2. Use a "TM" superscript in the most prominent places you mention "Hour of Code", both on your web site and in app descriptions.
  3. Include language on the page (or in the the footer), including links to the CSEdWeek and Code.org web sites, that says the following:
    
    *“The 'Hour of Code™' is a nationwide initiative by Computer Science Education Week[csedweek.org] and Code.org[code.org] to introduce millions of students to one hour of computer science and computer programming.”*

  4. No use of "Hour of Code" in app names.

## Enkura punkts

In order to more accurately track participation we ask every third party tutorial partners to include 1-pixel tracking images on the first and last page of their Hour of Code tutorials (A starting pixel-image on the start page and a final pixel-image on the end page. And not on interim pages).

This will allow us to count users who you directly recruit to visit your website to do their Hour of Code, or users who visit when a teacher types your URL directly on their whiteboard. It will lead to more accurate participation counts for your tutorial, which will help you attract users. If you integrate the pixel at the end it will also allow us to measure tutorial completion rates.

If your tutorial is approved and included on the final tutorial page, Code.org will provide you with a unique tracking pixel for you to integrate into your tutorial. See example below.

NOTE: this isn't important to do for installable apps (iOS/Android apps, or desktop-install apps)

Example tracking pixels for AppInventor:

IMG SRC = <http://code.org/api/hour/begin_appinventor.png>   
IMG SRC = <http://code.org/api/hour/finish_appinventor.png>

## Veiciniet savu mācību laiku datorzinātnes un izglītības nedēļā un "Programmēšanas stundā"

We are asking everyone to promote their own 1-hour tutorial to your users. Please direct them to ***your*** Hour of Code page. Your users are much more likely to react to a mailing from you about your tutorial. Use the international Hour of Code campaign for Computer Science Education Week as an excuse to encourage users to invite others to join in, help us reach 100 million total participants.

  * Feature Hour of Code and CSEdWeek on your website. Ex: <http://www.tynker.com/hour-of-code>
  * Popularizē Programmēšanas skolu tradicionālajos un sociālajos medijos, e-pastu listēs u.c., izmanto haštagu (mirkļbirku) **#HourOfCode** (ar lielajiem burtiem H, O, C)
  * Vadi vietējo notikumu vai palūdz saviem darbiniekiem to darīt tuvējās skolās vai komūnās.
  * Iepazīstieties ar mūsu resursu materiāliem (drīzumā).
