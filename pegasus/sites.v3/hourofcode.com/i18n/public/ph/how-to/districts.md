# How to bring the Hour of Code to your entire school district

## Kumuha ng mga kalahok sa bawat paaralan, bawat mag-aaral ay matututo!

  1. **Recruit local schools.** Share [this email](<%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#sample-emails') %>) and [teacher how to guide](<%= resolve_url('/how-to') %>), or include a [short blurb](<%= resolve_url('/promote/stats') %>) in newsletters/district communications.

  2. **Provide a sample logistics plan for schools.** Share this [sample logistics plan](<%= localized_file('/files/HOC_Logistics_plan.pdf') %>) with schools to give them ideas of how to organize whole school participation. Ito ay napaka-dali tulad ng paggawa nito sa bawat klase ng matematika, homeroom, o sa loob ng bawat linggo sa computer lab.

  3. ** Ibahagi sa social media. </> I-post sa  Facebook </> o  Twitter </> . Or share one of these inspirational [pictures and quotes](<%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#social') %>) from world leaders, or [stats](<%= resolve_url('/promote/stats') %>).</p></li> 
    
      * **Promote on your district’s homepage.** Let visitors know about your participation and Hour of Code events. Link it to [Hour of Code](<%= resolve_url('/') %>).
    
      * **Host a district Hour of Code event.** See our [event how to guide](<%= resolve_url('/how-to/events') %>) for a sample run of show, media outreach kit and other supports.</ol> 
    
    ## What comes after the Hour of Code?
    
    The Hour of Code is just the first step on a journey to learn more about how technology works and how to create software applications. To continue this journey:
    
      * Encourage students to continue to [learn online](<%= resolve_url('https://code.org/learn/beyond') %>).
      * [Attend](<%= resolve_url('https://code.org/professional-development-workshops') %>) a 1-day, in-person workshop to receive instruction from an experienced computer science facilitator. (US educators only)
