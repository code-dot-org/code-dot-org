# Paano dalhin ang Hour of Code sa iyong kumpanya

### Find out how you and your employees can inspire students to try computer science!

---

## Connect with local classrooms and volunteer for the Hour of Code

Code.org offers the opportunity for your employees to [connect](<%= codeorg_url('/volunteer') %>) with local classrooms doing the Hour of Code where they can share their tech career experience and inspire students to study computer science.

[<button>Sign up to volunteer!</button>](<%= codeorg_url('/volunteer') %>) <br /> <br />

For more instructions on encouraging employees and connecting your employees with classrooms, check out our [guide for corporate partners](<%= localized_file('/files/hoc-corporate-toolkit.pdf') %>).

## Additional ways companies can support the Hour of Code

- Ask your CEO to [send a company-wide email](<%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#sample-emails') %>) emphasizing the importance of computer science and encouraging employees to spread the word.
- Host an Hour of Code Happy Hour with coworkers to try the [activities](<%= resolve_url('/learn') %>).
- Host an Hour of Code event for a local classroom of students or non profits partners to do an Hour of Code at your company’s office. See event how-to guide below.

## Paunlarin ang iyong Hour of Code

- Promote your [Hour of Code](<%= resolve_url('/promote') %>) event and encourage others to host.
- Encourage software engineers at your company to visit a local classroom to help lead an Hour of Code and inspire students to study computer science. They can [sign up](<%= codeorg_url('/volunteer/engineer') %>) to be connected with a classroom.

## 3. Pumili ng aktibidad

We host a variety of [fun, hour-long activities](<%= resolve_url('/learn') %>) for participants of all ages, created by a variety of partners. [Subukan ang mga ito!](<%= resolve_url('/learn') %>)

**All Hour of Code activities** require minimal prep-time, and are self-guided - allowing participants to work at their own pace and skill-level.

## 4. Planuhin ang pangangailangan ng iyong teknolohiya - ang computer ay opsyonal

Ang pinakamahusay na karanasan sa Hour of Code ay kabilang ang internet-connected computers. But you **don’t** need a computer for every participant, and you can even do the Hour of Code without a computer at all.

**Plan Ahead!** Do the following before your event starts:

- Test activities on computers or devices. Make sure they work properly on browsers with sound and video.
- Provide headphones, or ask participants to bring their own, if the activity you choose works best with sound.
- **Walang sapat na aparato**Gumamit ng [pares na programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q). When participants partner up, they help each other and rely less on the organizer. Makikita din nila na ang computer science ay panlipunan at pakikipagtulungan.
- **Have low bandwidth?** Plan to show videos at the front of the event, so each participant isn't downloading their own videos. Or try the unplugged / offline activities.

## 5. Simulan ang iyong Hour of Code ng isang nakakapukaw damdaming video

I-kick off ang iyong Hour of Code sa pamamagitan ng pagpukaw sa mga kalahok at pinapaliwanag kung paano nakakaapekto ang computer science sa bawat bahagi ng ating buhay. Share more about what inspired you to pursue computer science and your role at your company.

**Magpakita ng nakakapukaw na video:**

- Ang orihinal na Code.org na inilunsad na video, kasama sina Bilk Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, at NBA star na si Chris Bosh (mayroong [1 minuto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYZF6oIZtfc), [5 minuto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc), at [9 minuto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1xS07N-FA) na mga version).
- Ang [Hour of Code na Pambuong Mundong Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsOIlDT145A)
- [Si Presidente Obama ay nananawagan sa lahat ng mga estudyante na pag aralan ang computer science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvmhE1J9PY).
- Makakahanap ka ng mga kagila-gilalas na videos [dito](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNfpD8i4Sx7U0y2MccnrNZuP).

**Ideas to introduce your Hour of Code activity to students:**

- Explain ways technology impacts our lives, with examples both boys and girls will care about - talk about technology that’s saving lives, helping people, connecting people.
- If you are a tech company, demo fun, innovative products your company is working on.
- If you aren’t a tech company, discuss ways your company uses technology to solve problems and accomplish goals.
- Invite software engineers from your company to speak about why they decided to study computer science and the projects they work on.
- See tips for getting girls interested in computer science [here](<%= codeorg_url('/girls') %>).

## 6. Mag-Code!

**Patnubayan ang mga kalahok sa aktibidad**

- Write the activity link on a whiteboard. Find the link listed on the [information for your selected activity](<%= resolve_url('/learn') %>) under the number of participants.
- For younger students, load the activity page ahead of time or save it as a bookmark.

**When participants come across difficulties it's okay to respond:**

- "Hindi ko alam. Subukan nating alaman ito ng magkasama"
- "Ang pag-aaral kung paano mag-program ay katulad ng pag-aaral ng isang bagong wika; hindi ka kaagad maging mahusay."

**Anong gagawin kung mayroong natapos ng mas maaga?**

- They can try another Hour of Code activity at hourofcode.com/learn.
- Or, ask them to help a friend who are having trouble with the activity.

## 7) Magbunyi

- [Print certificates](<%= codeorg_url('/certificates') %>) for participants and students.
- [Print "I did an Hour of Code!"](<%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#stickers') %>) stickers.
- [Order custom t-shirts](http://blog.code.org/post/132608499493/hour-of-code-shirts-and-more) for your employees.
- Ibahagi ang mga larawan at video sa mga nangyayari sa iyong Hour of Code sa social media. Gamitin ang #HourOfCode at @codeorg para maaari rin naming i-highlight ang iyong pinagtatagumpayan!
