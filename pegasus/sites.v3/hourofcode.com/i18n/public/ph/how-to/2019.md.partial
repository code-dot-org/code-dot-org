# How to plan your Hour of Code

### Sumali sa kilusan at ipakilala ang grupo ng mga studyante sa kanilang unang oras ng computer science sa mga hakbang na ito. Ang Oras ng Code ay madaling gumana - kahit para sa mga baguhan! If you'd like an extra set of hands to help out, you can find a [local volunteer]({{ urls/volunteer_local }}) to help run an Hour of Code in your class.

### Take a look at our [participation guide if you still have questions]({{ localized_files/participation_guide }}).

## 1. Watch this how-to video <iframe width="500" height="255" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/SrnvvWDm73k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen mark="crwd-mark"></iframe>

## 2. Explore Activities and Tutorials

We provide a variety of fun, [student-guided tutorials]({{ urls/learn }}) for all age groups and experience levels. It’s popular for students to try self-led tutorials, though many activities include lesson plans for teachers to guide discussion or extend the activity as well.

Explore the activities and decide ahead of time if you want to choose a single tutorial for all of your students, or let each child pick their own.

## 3. Create your Plan for the Day

### Think about your technology needs - computers are optional!

- Ang pinakamahusay na karanasan sa Hour of Code ay kabilang ang internet-connected computers. But you don’t need a computer for every child, and you can even do the Hour of Code without a computer at all! For [unplugged activities](/learn), simply filter the Classroom Technology section to show options for “No computers or devices”.
- Siguruhing subukan ang mga pagtuturo sa computer ng mga studyante o sa mga aparato para masigurong gumagana ito ng maaayos sa mga browsers ng may kasamang tunog at video. Have low bandwidth? Plan to show videos at the front of the class, so each student isn't downloading their own videos. Or try the offline tutorials.
- Maglaan ng headphones para sa iyong klase, o kaya ay pagdalhin ang mga studyante ng sarili nila, kung ang pagtuturong napili mo ay mas maayos kung may tunog.
- Don't have enough devices? Use [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q). Kapag nag kapareha ang mga studyante, tinutulungan nila ang isa't isa at hindi masyadong umaasa sa guro. Makikita din nila na ang computer science ay panlipunan at pakikipagtulungan.

### Pick a day and time

People around the world join in the Hour of Code celebration during CS Education Week (December 9-13) when the latest tutorials and activities are released. But you can do an Hour of Code any day of the year!

## 4. Promote your Hour of Code

Now that you've planned your event, it's time to start promoting it!

### Tell your School and Community

Promote the Hour of Code to other teachers who may want to join in on the fun! This is also a great opportunity to reach out to your school’s PTSA or share in parent newsletters, letting them know their children may come home wanting to try more activities and tutorials!

### Let Volunteers Know by Registering Your Event

When you [sign-up your Hour of Code event](/), you’ll receive helpful email communications with news and tips for hosting a successful Hour of Code. It’s also how you can let local volunteers know your school is participating. Volunteers are a great resource and can come speak to your class about computer science or simply help your students with Hour of Code activities.

### Get your Students Excited

Lead up to the event by sharing [inspirational videos](/promote/resources) highlighting diverse people and creative ways that computer science can be used. Or order inspirational posters for your classroom! Students are more excited to participate in a subject when they see people who look like them encouraging it.

Learn more about posters, videos, stickers and other ways to [promote your event](/promote/resources#posters) to your community.

## 5. Start your Hour of Code Strong

Once your Hour of Code celebration has arrived, make sure you start your event strong with some of these tools and tips.

Invite a [local volunteer]({{ urls/volunteer_local }}) to inspire your students by talking about the breadth of possibilities in computer science. There are thousands of volunteers around the world ready to help with your Hour of Code through either a classroom visit or video chat with your students!

Magpakita ng nakakapukaw na video:

- Ang orihinal na Code.org na inilunsad na video, nabilang sina Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, at NBA star na si Chris Bosh. (Mayroong [1 minuto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYZF6oIZtfc), [5 minuto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc), at[9 minuto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1xS07N-FA) na mga version available)
- Find more inspirational [resources]({{ urls/inspire }}) and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNfpD8i4Sx7U0y2MccnrNZuP).

It’s okay if both you and your students are brand new to computer science. Here are some ideas to introduce your Hour of Code activity:

- Ipaliwanag ang mga paraan kung paano naapektuhan ng teknolohiya ang ating mga buhay, sa mga halimbawa ang parehong lalaki at babae ay aasikasuhin (makipag-usap tungkol sa pag-save ng mga buhay, pagtulong sa mga tao, pagkonekta sa mga tao, atbp.).
- Bilang isang klase, mag lista ng mga bagay na ginagamitan ng code sa araw araw na buhay.
- See tips for getting girls interested in computer science [here]({{ urls/girls }}).


## 6. Get Coding!

Direct students to the activity

- Write the tutorial link on a whiteboard. Find the link listed on the [information for your selected tutorial]({{ urls/learn }}) under the number of participants.

When your students come across difficulties it's okay to respond:

- “I don’t know. Let’s figure this out together.”
- "Ang teknolohiya ay hindi palaging nakaayon sa ating kagustuhan."
- "Ang pag-aaral kung paano mag-program ay katulad ng pag-aaral ng isang bagong wika; hindi ka kaagad maging mahusay."

What if a student finishes early?

- Students can see all tutorials and [try another Hour of Code activity]({{ urls/learn }}).
- O, tanungin ang mga estudyanteng maagang natapos kung pwedeng makatulong sila sa mga nahihirapan sa aktibidad.
