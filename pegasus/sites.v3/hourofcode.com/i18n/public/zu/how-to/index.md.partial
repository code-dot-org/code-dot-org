# How to plan your Hour of Code

### Join the movement and introduce your students to computer science with these steps.

Students today should learn how to create technology, not just use it.

Trying an Hour of Code is a simple and fun way to introduce students to computer science, perhaps for the very first time! Find an activity that fits your setting, whether in-class or after-school, in-person or virtual. Take a look at our [participation guide if you still have questions]({{ localized_files/participation_guide }}) after checking out the steps below:

- [Watch the Hour of Code how-to video](#how-to-video)
- [Explore activities and tutorials](#explore-activities)

## 2. Explore activities and tutorials

We provide a variety of fun, [student-guided tutorials]({{ urls/learn }}) for all age groups and experience levels. It’s popular for students to try self-led tutorials, though many activities include lesson plans for teachers to guide discussion or extend the activity as well.

Explore the activities and decide ahead of time if you want to choose a single tutorial for all of your students, or let each child pick their own.

## 3. Create your plan for the day

### Think about your technology needs - computers are optional!

- Eyonandlela enhle kakhulu yokuthokozela iHora loKufingqwa ibandakanya nokuxhumana ngakhompyutha aneinternet. But you don’t need a computer for every child, and you can even do the Hour of Code without a computer at all! For [unplugged activities](/learn), simply filter the Classroom Technology section to show options for “No computers or devices”.
- Make sure to test tutorials on student computers or devices to ensure they work properly on browsers with sound and video. Have low bandwidth? Plan to show videos at the front of the class, so each student isn't downloading their own videos. Or try the offline tutorials.
- Nika ikilasi lakho ama-efoni, okanye ucele abafundi baziphathele awabo, uma imfundiso oyikhethile isebenza kahle ngomsindo.
- Don't have enough devices? Use [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q). Uma abafundi bebambisana, bathola ithuba lokusizana kanti futhi abathembeli kakhulu kuthisha. Bazobona futhi ukuba ikhompyutha sayensi iyabambisana futhi iyahlanganisa.

### Pick a day and time

People around the world join in the Hour of Code celebration during CS Education Week (December 5-11) when the latest tutorials and activities are released. But you can do an Hour of Code any day of the year!

## 4. Promote your Hour of Code

Now that you've planned your event, it's time to start promoting it!

### Tell your School and Community

Promote the Hour of Code to other teachers who may want to join in on the fun! This is also a great opportunity to reach out to your school’s PTSA or share in parent newsletters, letting them know their children may come home wanting to try more activities and tutorials!

### Let Volunteers Know by Registering Your Event

When you [sign up your Hour of Code event](/#join), you’ll receive helpful email communications with news and tips for hosting a successful Hour of Code. It’s also how you can let local volunteers know your school is participating. Volunteers are a great resource and can come speak to your class about computer science or simply help your students with Hour of Code activities.

### Get your Students Excited

Lead up to the event by sharing [inspirational videos](/promote/resources) highlighting diverse people and creative ways that computer science can be used. Or print inspirational posters for your classroom! Students are more excited to participate in a subject when they see people who look like them encouraging it.

## 5. How to start your Hour of Code strong

Once your Hour of Code celebration has arrived, make sure you start your event strong with some of these tools and tips.

Invite a [local volunteer]({{ urls/volunteer_local }}) to inspire your students by talking about the breadth of possibilities in computer science. There are thousands of volunteers around the world ready to help with your Hour of Code through either a classroom visit or video chat with your students!

Bonisa ngevidiyo ekhuthazayo:

- The original Code.org launch video, featuring Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and NBA star Chris Bosh. (There are [1 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYZF6oIZtfc), [5 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc), and [9 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1xS07N-FA) versions available)
- Find more inspirational [resources]({{ urls/inspire }}) and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNfpD8i4Sx7U0y2MccnrNZuP).

It’s okay if both you and your students are brand new to computer science. Here are some ideas to introduce your Hour of Code activity:

- Explain ways that technology impacts our lives, with examples both boys and girls will care about (talk about saving lives, helping people, connecting people, etc.).
- Njengekilasi, bala izinto ezisebenzisa ukufingqwa kumpilo yemihla ngemihla.
- See tips for getting young women interested in computer science [here]({{ urls/girls }}).

## 6. Get coding!

Direct students to the activity

- Write the tutorial link on a whiteboard. Find the link listed on the [information for your selected tutorial]({{ urls/learn }}) under the number of participants.

When your students come across difficulties it's okay to respond:

- "Angazi. Asisebenzisane ukuthola isicazululo."
- "Ithekhiniloji ayisebenzi ngendlela esithandangayo njalonjalo."
- "Ukufunda ukuphrogrema kufana nokufunda ulwimi olusha, awuzoqephuza ngokushesha."

What if a student finishes early?

- Students can see all tutorials and [try another Hour of Code activity]({{ urls/learn }}).
- Okanye, cela abafundi abaqeda kuqala ukuba basize labo bafunda abanekinga ngomsebenzi.
