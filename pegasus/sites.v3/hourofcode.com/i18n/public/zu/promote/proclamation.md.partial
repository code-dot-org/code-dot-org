#### **RESOLUTION**


#### Supporting the goals and ideals of "Computer Science Education Week"

Whereas Computer Science Education Week highlights the crucial role that computer science plays in transforming our society and how computer science enables innovation and creates economic opportunities;

Whereas computing technology is an integral part of modern culture and is transforming how people interact with each other and the world around them;

Whereas computer science is transforming industry, creating new fields of commerce, driving innovation in all fields of science, and bolstering productivity in established economic sectors;

Whereas the field of computer science is a foundational subject that underpins the information technology sector of our economy, which is a significant contributor to United States economic output;

Whereas artificial intelligence literacy refers to the knowledge, skills, and attitudes associated with how artificial intelligence works, including fundamental concepts in computer science, and how to use artificial intelligence safely, responsibly, and ethically;

Whereas the field of computer science, including artificial intelligence, are technologies with the power to fundamentally transform nearly all sectors of the United States economy;

Whereas technological leadership in all areas of computer science, including artificial intelligence, is an economic and national security imperative;

Whereas the outlook for computer science jobs is bright with over 500,000 open computing positions across the country;

Whereas providing students the chance to participate in high-quality computer science activities exposes them to the rich opportunities the field offers and provides critical thinking skills that will serve them throughout their lives;

Whereas all students deserve a thorough preparation in computer science education, including access to the qualified teachers, technology, and age-appropriate curriculum needed to learn computer science at the elementary and secondary levels of education;

Whereas computer science education has challenges to address, including improving access to computer science courses for all students, and providing professional development for computer science teachers;
