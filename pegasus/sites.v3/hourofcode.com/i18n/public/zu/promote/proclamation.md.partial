# Sample Computer Science Education Week resolution

### Below is language for a sample resolution supportive of Computer Science Education Week and its goals that can be used by state and local legislators.

* * *

#### **RESOLUTION**  


#### Supporting the goals and ideals of "Computer Science Education Week"

Whereas Computer Science Education Week highlights the crucial role that computer science plays in transforming our society and how computer science enables innovation and creates economic opportunities;

Lapho ubucwepheshe bezekhompyutha buyingxenye ebaluleke kakhulu emasikweni esimanje kanti futhi buguqula indlela abantu abaxhumana ngayo nomhlaba obazungezile;

Lapho ikhompyutha sayensi iletha inguquko kumkhakha, idala imikhakha yezentengiselwano emisha, iqhuba imikhuba eqanjwe kabusha kukambu yesayensi, kanye nokuqinisa umkhiqizo kumkhakha ososunguliwe kwezomnotho;

Whereas the field of computer science is a foundational subject that underpins the information technology sector of our economy, which is a significant contributor to United States economic output;

Whereas artificial intelligence literacy refers to the knowledge, skills, and attitudes associated with how artificial intelligence works, including fundamental concepts in computer science, and how to use artificial intelligence safely, responsibly, and ethically;

Whereas the field of computer science, including artificial intelligence, are technologies with the power to fundamentally transform nearly all sectors of the United States economy;

Whereas technological leadership in all areas of computer science, including artificial intelligence, is an economic and national security imperative;

Lapho uma ubuka amathuba omsebenzi kukhompyutha sayensi abukeka egqamile njengoba izikhundla zidlulela ngale kumakhulu ayisihlanu enkulungwane ezweni lonke;

Lapho kunikezwa abafundi ithuba lokubamba iqhaza kumisebenzi yekhompyutha sayensi esezingeni eliphezulu elibadalula kumathuba acebile lenkambu enikela ngawo kanti futhi iphana ngekhono lokucabanga bukhali elizobasiza kukho konke emplilweni zabo zonke;

Lapho abafundi bonkana bafanelwe ulungiselelo olukahle kakhulu kumfundiso yekhompyutha sayensi, okubala ukufinyelela kothisha abanolwazi, ubuchwepheshe, kanye nekharikhulamu efanele iminyaka edingekayo ukufunda ikhompyutha sayensi ezingeni labaqalayo kanye elabavela kamuva emfundweni;

Whereas computer science education has challenges to address, including improving access to computer science courses for all students, and providing professional development for computer science teachers;

Lapho ukuthatha iqhaza kuHora loKufingqwa ngesikhathi seViki leMfundiso yeKhompyutha Sayensi kungasebenzela ukuhlandla kunkambu yekhompyutha sayensi kanye nokukhuthaza iningi yabafundi ukuthatha izifundo ezidlulele kukhompyutha sayensi;

Whereas the field of computer science has significant equity barriers to address, including attracting and retaining a field of candidates diverse in race, ethnicity, and gender at all levels and branches;

Lapho uGrace Murray Hopper, omunye wabesimame bokuqala kunkambi yekhompyutha sayensi, wanjiniyela ulwimi olusha lokuklama kanye futhi waphayona amazinga ezinhlelo zekhompyutha okuyinto ebeke isisekelo sokuthuthuka okiningi kukhompyutha sayensi; kanye

Whereas the week of {{ campaign_date/start_long }}, in honor of Grace Hopper's birthday, is designated as ‘Computer Science Education Week’: Now, therefore, be it <br />

Resolved, That the (HOUSE OR SENATE, STATE, COUNTY, CITY OR SCHOOL BOARD) --

(1) supports the designation of Computer Science Education Week ({{ campaign_date/full }});

(2) khuthaza izikole, othishela, abazali kanye nezishayamthetho ukuba bazibandakanye neViki leMfundiso yeKhompyutha Sayensi ngoku nika amadla kubafundi babo ukuze bakwazi ukuthatha ichaza kuHora loKufingqwa;

(3) encourages schools, teachers, researchers, universities, business leaders, and policymakers to identify mechanisms for teachers to receive cutting edge professional development to provide sustainable learning experiences in computer science at all educational levels and encourage students to be exposed to computer science concepts;

(4) encourages opportunities, including through existing programs, for female students and students from racial and ethnic groups underrepresented in computer science.
