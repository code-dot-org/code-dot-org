# 獎品-常見問題與解答

## 是否全校都需要參加才能贏得價值 $10,000 美元的硬體呢？

Yes. Your whole school has to participate to be eligible for the prize but only one person needs to register and submit the Hardware Prize application form [here](<%= resolve_url('/prizes') %>).

## 是否全校都需要參加才能贏得科技聊天嗎？

## 非公立學校可以獲得視訊聊天的獎勵嗎？

## 非美國的學校能贏得視訊聊天獎勵嗎？

No, unfortunately, because of logistics we are unable to offer the video chat prize to schools outside of the U.S. and Canada.

## 為甚麼價值一萬美元的硬體獎勵只提供給公立學校？

We would love to help teachers in public and private schools alike, but at this time, it comes down to logistics. We have partnered with [DonorsChoose.org](http://donorschoose.org) to administer classroom funding prizes, which only works with public, US K-12 schools. According to DonorsChoose.org, the organization is better able to access consistent and accurate data that's available for public schools.

## 我是美國以外的國家。可以領取獎品?

Due to a small full-time staff, Code.org is unable to handle the logistics of administering international prizes. Because of this people outside the US are unable to qualify for prizes.

## 硬件獎申請的截止日期是什麼時候?

To qualify, your entire school must register for the Hour of Code as well as complete the [Hardware Application form](<%= resolve_url('/prizes') %>) by November 16, 2015. 在每個美國州一所學校將收到一類組的電腦。 Code.org will select and notify winners via email by December 1, 2015.

## 如果我的學校或教室贏得獎品，會何時通知？

## If my whole school can’t do the Hour of Code during Computer Science Education Week (Dec. 7-13), can I still qualify for prizes?

Yes, just be sure to submit a logistics plan that outlines how your whole school is participating over a reasonable length of time and register for the Hour of Code by November 16th.
