### 把電腦科學帶進您的學校。從Hour of Code開始!

With technology changing every industry on the planet, computing knowledge has become part of a well-rounded skillset. But only one in every four schools teaches computer science! 好消息是我們正在改變此狀況。 If you heard about the Hour of Code last year, you might know it made history. 100 million students have now discovered how accessible and fun computer science can be by doing just one Hour of Code.

The Hour of Code is a one-hour introduction to computer science, designed to demystify code and show that anybody can learn the basics. Learn more at <http://HourofCode.com>, try an hour yourself, or host an Hour of Code event to introduce others to the world of computing!
