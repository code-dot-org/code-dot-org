# How to plan your Hour of Code

### 參與活動，并用下面的步驟向學生們介紹他們第一個小時的計算機科學。 編程一小時的課程對初學者來說都非常容易上手的！ If you'd like an extra set of hands to help out, you can find a [local volunteer]({{ urls/volunteer_local }}) to help run an Hour of Code in your class.

### Take a look at our [participation guide if you still have questions]({{ localized_files/participation_guide }}).

## 2. Explore Activities and Tutorials

We provide a variety of fun, [student-guided tutorials]({{ urls/learn }}) for all age groups and experience levels. It’s popular for students to try self-led tutorials, though many activities include lesson plans for teachers to guide discussion or extend the activity as well.

Explore the activities and decide ahead of time if you want to choose a single tutorial for all of your students, or let each child pick their own.

## 3. Create your Plan for the Day

### Think about your technology needs - computers are optional!

- 一小時玩程式課程在有網路連線的電腦上會有最佳的體驗。 But you don’t need a computer for every child, and you can even do the Hour of Code without a computer at all! For [unplugged activities](/learn), simply filter the Classroom Technology section to show options for “No computers or devices”.
- 在學生的電腦或其他設備上測試教程，確定音效、影片在瀏覽器能正常運作。 Have low bandwidth? Plan to show videos at the front of the class, so each student isn't downloading their own videos. Or try the offline tutorials.
- 如果教程需要音效，請提供耳機或要求學員自備。
- Don't have enough devices? Use [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q). 當學生們合作時，他們會互相幫忙，並減少對老師的依賴。 他們也將瞭解到電腦科學是需社交與合作的。

### Pick a day and time

People around the world join in the Hour of Code celebration during CS Education Week (December 9-13) when the latest tutorials and activities are released. But you can do an Hour of Code any day of the year!

## 4. Promote your Hour of Code

Now that you've planned your event, it's time to start promoting it!

### Tell your School and Community

Promote the Hour of Code to other teachers who may want to join in on the fun! This is also a great opportunity to reach out to your school’s PTSA or share in parent newsletters, letting them know their children may come home wanting to try more activities and tutorials!

### Let Volunteers Know by Registering Your Event

When you [sign-up your Hour of Code event](/), you’ll receive helpful email communications with news and tips for hosting a successful Hour of Code. It’s also how you can let local volunteers know your school is participating. Volunteers are a great resource and can come speak to your class about computer science or simply help your students with Hour of Code activities.

### Get your Students Excited

Lead up to the event by sharing [inspirational videos](/promote/resources) highlighting diverse people and creative ways that computer science can be used. Or order inspirational posters for your classroom! Students are more excited to participate in a subject when they see people who look like them encouraging it.

## 5. Start your Hour of Code Strong

Once your Hour of Code celebration has arrived, make sure you start your event strong with some of these tools and tips.

Invite a [local volunteer]({{ urls/volunteer_local }}) to inspire your students by talking about the breadth of possibilities in computer science. There are thousands of volunteers around the world ready to help with your Hour of Code through either a classroom visit or video chat with your students!

展示一支激勵人心的影片

- 正版的 Code.org 推出包括比爾蓋茨、馬克·扎克伯格和 NBA 球星克里斯. 波什的視頻。 (有 [ 1 分鐘 ](HTTPs://www.youtube.com/watch？v=qYZF6oIZtfc)、[ 5 分鐘 ](HTTPs://www.youtube.com/watch？v=nKIu9yen5nc) 和 [ 9 分鐘 ](HTTPs://www.youtube.com/watch？v=dU1xS07N-FA) 版本可用)
- Find more inspirational [resources]({{ urls/inspire }}) and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNfpD8i4Sx7U0y2MccnrNZuP).

It’s okay if both you and your students are brand new to computer science. Here are some ideas to introduce your Hour of Code activity:

- 通過男孩和女孩們都關心的例子，介紹科技如何影響我們的生活（比如拯救生命，幫助人們，連接人們等）
- 全班一起列出在日常生活中用到程式碼的事情。
- See tips for getting girls interested in computer science [here]({{ urls/girls }}).

## 6. Get Coding!

Direct students to the activity

- Write the tutorial link on a whiteboard. Find the link listed on the [information for your selected tutorial]({{ urls/learn }}) under the number of participants.

When your students come across difficulties it's okay to respond:

- 「我也不知道，我們一起找出方法吧。」
- 「科技不見得是以我們想的方式運作。」
- 「學習程式設計就像是學習新的語言；你不會馬上就上手。」

What if a student finishes early?

- Students can see all tutorials and [try another Hour of Code activity]({{ urls/learn }}).
- 或者，請提前完成的學生協助那些在活動遇到麻煩與的同學。

## 7. Celebrate your Students' Success
