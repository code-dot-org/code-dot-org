The Hour of Code is driven by the Hour of Code and Computer Science Education Week Advisory and Review Committees.

The [Advisory Committee]({{ urls/advisory_committee }}) is composed of representatives from K-12, academia, nonprofits, for-profits, and international organizations. This committee guides the strategy for the Hour of Code campaign.

[검토 위원회]({{ urls/review_committee }})는 K-12 학년 밴드의 15명 교육자로 구성되며 자문 위원회의 채점표를 사용하여 활동을 평가하고 추천합니다. These educators review student-led activities and teacher-led lesson plans submitted by hundreds of activity partners, evaluating the activities' educational value, ability to engage learners, and potential appeal to diverse sets of students.

Both committees' work and dedication have contributed to the success of the Hour of Code and its vision of offering an introduction to computer science for every student.
