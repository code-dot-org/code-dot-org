# How to involve your entire school district

### Every school in your district can take part in the largest learning event in history.

---

## 모든 학교들이 참여해서, 모든 학생들이 배워볼 수 있도록!

### 1. Recruit local schools

Share [this email](<%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#sample-emails') %>) and [teacher how to guide](<%= resolve_url('/how-to') %>), or include a [short blurb](<%= resolve_url('/promote/stats') %>) in newsletters/district communications. <br />

### 2. Provide a sample logistics plan for schools

Share this [sample logistics plan](<%= localized_file('/files/HOC_Logistics_plan.pdf') %>) with schools to give them ideas of how to organize whole school participation. It’s as easy as doing it in every math class, homeroom period, or rotating throughout the week through the computer lab.

### 3. Share on social media

Post to [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fhourofcode.com%2Fus) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhourofcode.com&text=I%27m%20participating%20in%20this%20year%27s%20%23HourOfCode%2C%20are%20you%3F%20%40codeorg&original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fq%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Ftwitter.com%252Fshare%253Fhashtags%253D%2526amp%253Brelated%253Dcodeorg%2526amp%253Btext%253DI%252527m%252Bparticipating%252Bin%252Bthis%252Byear%252527s%252B%252523HourOfCode%25252C%252Bare%252Byou%25253F%252B%252540codeorg%2526amp%253Burl%253Dhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fhourofcode.com%26sa%3DD%26sntz%3D1%26usg%3DAFQjCNE1GLTUbKZfMlEh9Aj5w0iswz6PYQ&related=codeorg&hashtags=). Or share one of these inspirational [pictures and quotes](<%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#social') %>) from world leaders, or [stats](<%= resolve_url('/promote/stats') %>).

### 4. Promote on your district’s homepage

Let visitors know about your participation and Hour of Code events. Link it to [Hour of Code](<%= resolve_url('/') %>).

### 5. Host a district Hour of Code event

See our [event how to guide](<%= resolve_url('/how-to/events') %>) for a sample run of show, media outreach kit, and other supports.

## Hour of Code 이후에는 어떤 것들이 있나요?

Hour of Code 는 컴퓨터과학기술이 어떻게 동작하고, 응용프로그램(앱) 들을 어떻게 만들어 낼 수 있는지 배울 수 있는 긴 여행의 첫 번째 시작입니다. 이 여행을 계속하려면:

- Encourage students to continue to [learn online](<%= codeorg_url('/learn/beyond') %>).
- [Attend](<%= codeorg_url('/professional-development-workshops') %>) a 1-day, in-person workshop to receive instruction from an experienced computer science facilitator. (US educators only)
