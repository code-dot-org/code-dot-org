## Key Tips

- 이벤트를 개최하기 2주 전에 이메일로 미디어들을 보내드립니다. 처음에 연락이 닿지 않으면 이메일과 휴대폰으로 알림이 발송됩니다.
- 학교 직원들이나 자원봉사자들에게 행사 사진을 찍어 온라인으로 공유하거나 언론에 보낼 수 있도록 도움을 요청하세요.
- 여러분의 웹사이트와 홈페이지에 Hour of Code에 대한 글을 올리고, 학교 신문에도 게제하세요. 여러분이 진행한 이벤트의 상세한 내용, 학생들의 사진과 활동을 올리세요.
- On Facebook and Twitter, share updates on your plans, announce your events, and post pictures during <%= campaign_date('year') %>. Use the hashtag **#HourOfCode** so Code.org can see and promote your events.

## Step-by-step guide

### 1. Plan your event

- Hour of Code를 시작하기 위한 단계적 절차들을 계획하세요.
- Send [a letter](<%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#sample-emails') %>) to parents and ask them to spread the word.
- Send [a letter](<%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#sample-emails') %>) to invite your local mayor, member of Congress, governor, or influential businessperson to attend and speak to your students.
- 모둠 활동(언플러그드 프로그래밍 활동과 같은...)을 조직하거나, 학생들이 만들어낸 것들을 발표하고, 여러 가지 활동들을 이끌어내세요.
- Show Code.org’s [Hour of Code video](<%= resolve_url('/') %>) or one of [these videos](<%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#videos') %>) to inspire students. <br />

### 2. Identify specific reporters that cover education or local events

Like local newspapers, TV station or radio stations, or blogs. <br />

### 3. Contact local media

The best way to reach out is by email. It should be short and should communicate "why should other people care about this event"? Include contact information (including a cellphone number) for who will be on site at the event. **[See a sample pitch to media](<%= resolve_url('/promote/press-kit#sample-emails') %>)**.

Look online to find reporter contact information. If you can't find it, call the publication to ask, or email the organization's general email address and ask for your message to be directed to the correct reporter. <br />

### 4. Prepare to field questions about your school event. Here are some examples:

#### Why is your school doing an Hour of Code?

While all of us know that it’s important for students to learn how to navigate today’s tech-saturated world, many teachers aren’t experienced in computer science and don’t know where to start. This event is a chance for all of us to see what computer science is about.

We hope it’ll spark interest in students to keep learning. Research also shows that kids can pick up programming concepts before they know how to read and write. In fact, their brains are more receptive to computer languages at a young age, just like foreign languages. <br /> <br />

#### Why is this important?

Technology is transforming every industry on the planet. In 2015, 7 million openings in the U.S. were in occupations—including art and design—that value coding skills. But 60 percent of schools in the U.S. don't teach computer science. It’s time for us to catch up to the 21st-century. We know that regardless of what our students do when they grow up, whether they go into medicine, business, politics, or the arts, knowing how to build technology will give them confidence and a competitive edge. <br />

## Sample email to send to invite local media to your event

**Subject line**: Local school joins mission to introduce students to computer science

Computers are everywhere, changing every industry on the planet, but fewer than half of all schools teach computer science. Girls and minorities are severely underrepresented in computer science classes, and in the tech industry. 그래도 좋은 소식은, 이제 우리가 이러한 상황을 바꾸어가고 있다는 것입니다.

With the Hour of Code, computer science has been on homepages of Google, MSN, Yahoo!, and Disney. Over 100 partners have joined together to support this movement. Every Apple Store in the world has hosted an Hour of Code. Even President Obama wrote his first line of code as part of the campaign.

That’s why every one of the [X number] students at [SCHOOL NAME] are joining in on the largest learning event in history: The Hour of Code, during Computer Science Education Week (December 3-9).

I'm writing to invite you to attend our kickoff assembly and to see kids start the activity on [DATE].

The Hour of Code, organized by the nonprofit Code.org and over 100 others, is a global movement that believes the students of today are ready to learn critical skills for 21st-century success. Please join us.
