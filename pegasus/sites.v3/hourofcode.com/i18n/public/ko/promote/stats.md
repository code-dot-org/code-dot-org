### 여러분의 학교에 컴퓨터과학(정보과학) 수업을 가져가 보세요. Hour of Code 로 시작하면 됩니다.

With technology changing every industry on the planet, computing knowledge has become part of a well-rounded skillset. But only one in every four schools teaches computer science! 그래도 좋은 소식은, 이제 우리가 이러한 상황을 바꾸어가고 있다는 것입니다. If you heard about the Hour of Code last year, you might know it made history. 100 million students have now discovered how accessible and fun computer science can be by doing just one Hour of Code.

The Hour of Code is a one-hour introduction to computer science, designed to demystify code and show that anybody can learn the basics. Learn more at <http://HourofCode.com>, try an hour yourself, or host an Hour of Code event to introduce others to the world of computing!
