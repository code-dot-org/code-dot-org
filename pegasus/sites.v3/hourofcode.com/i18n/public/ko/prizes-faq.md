## 왜 공립학교들만 $10,000 상당의 하드웨어 지원금(상품)을 받을 기회가 있나요?

We would love to help teachers in public and private schools alike, but at this time, it comes down to logistics. We have partnered with [DonorsChoose.org](http://donorschoose.org) to administer classroom funding prizes, which only works with public, US K-12 schools. According to DonorsChoose.org, the organization is better able to access consistent and accurate data that's available for public schools.

## 저는 미국 밖에 있습니다. 저도 상품들에 응모할 수 있나요?

Due to a small full-time staff, Code.org is unable to handle the logistics of administering international prizes. Because of this people outside the US are unable to qualify for prizes.
