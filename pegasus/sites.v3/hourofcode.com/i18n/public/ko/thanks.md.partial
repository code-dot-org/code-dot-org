# Thanks for signing up to host an Hour of Code!

<br /> **The Hour of Code runs during {{ campaign_date/full }} and we'll be in touch about new tutorials and other exciting updates as they come out. In the meantime, what can you do now?**

As a special thank you to Hour of Code organizers, we have a new poster set featuring Malala, Stephen Curry, Shakira and more available to order at a [50% discount from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/promocode/A3QAYNZUZTSSNQ). This year, each set comes with 6 posters and 126 "I did the Hour of Code" stickers. With the discount you'll get them for less than our cost to make them. Supplies are limited, so order your posters soon. If you're not in the United States, you can [download and print all posters]({{ promote/promote_posters_url }}).

## 1. Spread the word in your school and community

You just joined the Hour of Code movement. Tell your friends with **#HourOfCode**!

{{ social_media_hoc }} <br /> Encourage others to participate [with our sample emails.]({{ promote/sample_emails }}) Contact your principal and challenge every classroom at your school to sign up. Recruit a local group — boy/girl scouts club, church, university, veterans group, labor union, or even some friends. 새로운 기술들을 배우기 위해서 학교에서만 있을 필요는 없습니다. Invite a local politician or policy maker to visit your school for the Hour of Code. 그렇게 하면 여러분 지역에서 한 시간의 Hour of Code 이후의 컴퓨터과학(정보과학) 수업이 이루어지는데 큰 도움이 될 수 있습니다.

Use these [posters, banners, stickers, videos and more]({{ promote/resources }}) for your own event.

## 2. 이벤트 행사를 도와줄 수 있는 지역 자원 봉사자 찾기

[Search our volunteer map]({{ urls/volunteer_local }}) for volunteers who can visit your classroom or video chat remotely to inspire your students about the breadth of possibilities with computer science.

## 3. Plan your Hour of Code

Choose an [Hour of Code activity](https://hourofcode.com/learn) for your classroom and [review this how-to guide]({{ urls/how_to_guide }}).

### 4. Stock up on swag

Order materials to help get students excited about your event by heading to the Code.org [Amazon store](https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/8557B2A6-EBF2-4C9F-95C5-C3256FBA0220). [Order posters](https://www.amazon.com/promocode/A3QAYNZUZTSSNQ) (and get an extra 50% off), Hour of Code kits, stickers, and more! But hurry, supplies are limited.
