# مننه، چې د کوډ ساعت د کوربونې لپاره مو ځان ثبت کړ!

<br /> **The Hour of Code runs during <%= campaign_date('full') %> and we'll be in touch about new tutorials and other exciting updates as they come out. In the meantime, what can you do now?**

## 1. Spread the word in your school and community

You just joined the Hour of Code movement. Tell your friends with **#HourOfCode**!

<%= view :share_buttons, facebook:facebook, twitter:twitter %> <br /> Encourage others to participate [with our sample emails.](%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#sample-emails') %) Contact your principal and challenge every classroom at your school to sign up. Recruit a local group — boy/girl scouts club, church, university, veterans group, labor union, or even some friends. You don't have to be in school to learn new skills. Invite a local politician or policy maker to visit your school for the Hour of Code. It can help build support for computer science in your area beyond one hour.

Use these [posters, banners, stickers, videos and more](%= resolve_url('/promote/resources') %) for your own event.

## 2. Find a local volunteer to help you with your event.

[Search our volunteer map](%= codeorg_url('/volunteer/local') %) for volunteers who can visit your classroom or video chat remotely to inspire your students about the breadth of possibilities with computer science.

## 3. Plan your Hour of Code

Choose an [Hour of Code activity](https://hourofcode.com/learn) for your classroom and [review this how-to guide](%= resolve_url('/how-to') %).

# Go beyond an Hour of Code

<% if @country == 'us' %> An Hour of Code is just the beginning. Whether you are an administrator, teacher, or advocate, we have [professional development, curriculum, and resources to help you bring computer science classes to your school or expand your offerings.](https://code.org/yourschool) If you already teach computer science, use these resources during CS Education Week to rally support from your administration, parents, and community.

You have many choices to fit your school. Most of the organizations offering Hour of Code tutorials also have curriculum and professional development available. If you find a lesson you like, ask about going further. To help you get started, we've highlighted a number of [curriculum providers that will help you or your students go beyond an hour.](https://hourofcode.com/beyond)
