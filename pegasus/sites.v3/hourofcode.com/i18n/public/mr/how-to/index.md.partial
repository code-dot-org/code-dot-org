# How to plan your Hour of Code

### Join the movement and introduce a group of students to their first hour of computer science with these steps. The Hour of Code is easy to run - even for beginners! If you'd like an extra set of hands to help out, you can find a [local volunteer]({{ urls/volunteer_local }}) to help run an Hour of Code in your class.

### Take a look at our [participation guide if you still have questions]({{ localized_files/participation_guide }}).

## 1. Watch this how-to video <iframe width="500" height="255" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/SrnvvWDm73k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen mark="crwd-mark"></iframe> 

## 2. Explore Activities and Tutorials

We provide a variety of fun, [student-guided tutorials]({{ urls/learn }}) for all age groups and experience levels. It’s popular for students to try self-led tutorials, though many activities include lesson plans for teachers to guide discussion or extend the activity as well.

Explore the activities and decide ahead of time if you want to choose a single tutorial for all of your students, or let each child pick their own.

## 3. Create your Plan for the Day

### Think about your technology needs - computers are optional!

- अवर ऑफ कोड चा सर्वोत्तम अनुभव घेण्यासाठी इंटरनेट ला जोडलेला संगणक आवश्यक आहे. But you don’t need a computer for every child, and you can even do the Hour of Code without a computer at all! For [unplugged activities](/learn), simply filter the Classroom Technology section to show options for “No computers or devices”.
- Make sure to test tutorials on student computers or devices to ensure they work properly on browsers with sound and video. Have low bandwidth? Plan to show videos at the front of the class, so each student isn't downloading their own videos. Or try the offline tutorials.
- प्रतीयोगींना स्वत: चा हेडफोन आणावयास सांगणे किंवा उपलब्ध करून देणे. शिकवण्या आवाजासाहित नीट चालतात हे पाहणे.
- Don't have enough devices? Use [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q). जेंव्हा प्रतियोगी जोडीने काम करतात, तेंव्हा ते एकमेकांना मदत करतात आणि त्यामुळे आयोजकांवर कमी अवलंबून राहतात. संगणकशास्त्र के परस्पर सहकार्याने करण्याचे आणि सामाजिक असल्याचे याने समजते.

### Pick a day and time

People around the world join in the Hour of Code celebration during CS Education Week (December 9-13) when the latest tutorials and activities are released. But you can do an Hour of Code any day of the year!

## 4. Promote your Hour of Code

Now that you've planned your event, it's time to start promoting it!

### Tell your School and Community

Promote the Hour of Code to other teachers who may want to join in on the fun! This is also a great opportunity to reach out to your school’s PTSA or share in parent newsletters, letting them know their children may come home wanting to try more activities and tutorials!

### Let Volunteers Know by Registering Your Event

When you [sign-up your Hour of Code event](/), you’ll receive helpful email communications with news and tips for hosting a successful Hour of Code. It’s also how you can let local volunteers know your school is participating. Volunteers are a great resource and can come speak to your class about computer science or simply help your students with Hour of Code activities.

### Get your Students Excited

Lead up to the event by sharing [inspirational videos](/promote/resources) highlighting diverse people and creative ways that computer science can be used. Or order inspirational posters for your classroom! Students are more excited to participate in a subject when they see people who look like them encouraging it.

Learn more about posters, videos, stickers and other ways to [promote your event](/promote/resources#posters) to your community.

## 5. Start your Hour of Code Strong

Once your Hour of Code celebration has arrived, make sure you start your event strong with some of these tools and tips.

Invite a [local volunteer]({{ urls/volunteer_local }}) to inspire your students by talking about the breadth of possibilities in computer science. There are thousands of volunteers around the world ready to help with your Hour of Code through either a classroom visit or video chat with your students!

प्रेरणादायी व्हिडीओ दाखवावा:

- The original Code.org launch video, featuring Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and NBA star Chris Bosh. (There are [1 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYZF6oIZtfc), [5 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc), and [9 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1xS07N-FA) versions available)
- Find more inspirational [resources]({{ urls/inspire }}) and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNfpD8i4Sx7U0y2MccnrNZuP).

It’s okay if both you and your students are brand new to computer science. Here are some ideas to introduce your Hour of Code activity:

- Explain ways that technology impacts our lives, with examples both boys and girls will care about (talk about saving lives, helping people, connecting people, etc.).
- दैनंदिन जीवनात कॉम्पुटर प्रोग्रामिंग (code) कश्याकरिता करता त्याची यादी करा.
- See tips for getting girls interested in computer science [here]({{ urls/girls }}).

## 6. Get Coding!

Direct students to the activity

- Write the tutorial link on a whiteboard. Find the link listed on the [information for your selected tutorial]({{ urls/learn }}) under the number of participants.

When your students come across difficulties it's okay to respond:

- "मला माहिती नाही. आपण एकत्र सोडवण्याचा प्रयत्न करू."
- "तंत्रज्ञान कायमच आपल्याला पाहिजे तसेच काम करेल असे नाही."
- "संगणक आज्ञावली शिकणे हे एखादी नवीन भाषा शिकण्यासारखे आहे; लगेचच काही सहजपणे वापरता येणार नाही."

What if a student finishes early?

- Students can see all tutorials and [try another Hour of Code activity]({{ urls/learn }}).
- किंवा, ज्या विद्यार्थ्यांचे काम लवकर संपले आहे त्यांना, ज्यांना काम करण्यास अडचणी येत आहेत, त्यांना मदत करण्यास सांगणे.

## 7. Celebrate your Students' Success

[/col-33]

- [Print certificates]({{ urls/certificates }}) for your students.
- [Print "I did an Hour of Code!"]({{ urls/promote_stickers }}) stickers for your students.
- तुमच्या शाळेकरिता [विशेष (सानुकूल) बनवलेले टी शर्ट](http://blog.code.org/post/132608499493/hour-of-code-shirts-and-more) मागवणे.
- या घटनेची छायाचित्रे आणि व्हिडीओ सोशल मेडिया (समाज माध्यमे) वर उपलब्ध करावी. #HourOfCode आणि @codeorg हे वापरून तसे केल्यास तुमचे यशसुद्धा उठून दिसेल!
