# एक घंटा कोड का कैसे पढ़ानेकी तकनीक

Join the movement and introduce a group of students to their first hour of computer science with these steps:

## 1) Watch this how-to video <iframe width="500" height="255" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/SrnvvWDm73k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
## 2) Choose a tutorial for your hour:

We provide a variety of [fun, hour-long tutorials](<%= resolve_url('https://code.org/learn') %>) for students of all ages, created by a variety of partners.

**[Student-guided Hour of Code tutorials:](<%= resolve_url("https://code.org/learn") %>)**

  * प्रशिक्षकोंको कम से कम तैयारी की आवश्यकता
  * छात्र स्वअध्ययन से अपनी गतिसे काम कर सकते है

**[Teacher-guided Hour of Code tutorials:](<%= resolve_url("https://code.org/educate/teacher-led") %>)**

  * Are lesson plans that require some advance teacher preparation
  * Are categorized by grade level *and* by subject area (eg Math, English, etc)

## 3) Promote your Hour of Code

Promote your Hour of Code [with these tools](<%= resolve_url('/promote') %>) and encourage others to host their own events.

## 4) Plan your technology needs - computers are optional

The best Hour of Code experience includes Internet-connected computers. But you **don’t** need a computer for every child, and you can even do the Hour of Code without a computer at all.

**Plan Ahead!** Do the following before your event starts:

  * Test tutorials on student computers or devices. Make sure they work properly on browsers with sound and video.
  * Provide headphones for your class, or ask students to bring their own, if the tutorial you choose works best with sound.
  * **Don't have enough devices?** Use [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q). When students partner up, they help each other and rely less on the teacher. They’ll also see that computer science is social and collaborative.
  * **Have low bandwidth?** Plan to show videos at the front of the class, so each student isn't downloading their own videos. Or try the unplugged / offline tutorials.

## 5) Start your Hour of Code off with an inspiring speaker or video

**Invite a [local volunteer](https://code.org/volunteer/local) to inspire your students by talking about the breadth of possibilities in computer science.** There are thousands of volunteers around the world ready to help with your Hour of Code. [Use this map](https://code.org/volunteer/local) to find local volunteers who can visit your classroom or join a video chat with your students.

**Show an inspirational video:**

  * The original Code.org launch video, featuring Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and NBA star Chris Bosh (There are [1 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYZF6oIZtfc), [5 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc), and [9 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1xS07N-FA) versions)
  * The [Hour of Code 2013 launch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC5FbmsH4fw), or the <% if @country == 'uk' %> [Hour of Code 2015 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L97YMYqLHc) <% else %> [Hour of Code 2015 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L97YMYqLHc) <% end %>
  * [President Obama calling on all students to learn computer science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvmhE1J9PY)
  * Find more inspirational videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNfpD8i4Sx7U0y2MccnrNZuP).

**It’s okay if both you and your students are brand new to computer science. Here are some ideas to introduce your Hour of Code activity:**

  * Explain ways that technology impacts our lives, with examples both boys and girls will care about (Talk about saving lives, helping people, connecting people, etc.).
  * As a class, list things that use code in everyday life.
  * See tips for getting girls interested in computer science [here](<%= resolve_url('https://code.org/girls') %>).

**Need more guidance?** Download this [template lesson plan](/files/EducatorHourofCodeLessonPlanOutline.docx).

**Want more teaching ideas?** Check out [best practices](http://www.slideshare.net/TeachCode/hour-of-code-best-practices-for-successful-educators-51273466) from experienced educators.

## 6) Code!

**Direct students to the activity**

  * Write the tutorial link on a whiteboard. Find the link listed on the [information for your selected tutorial](<%= resolve_url('https://code.org/learn') %>) under the number of participants.

**When your students come across difficulties it's okay to respond:**

  * “I don’t know. Let’s figure this out together.”
  * “Technology doesn’t always work out the way we want.”
  * “Learning to program is like learning a new language; you won’t be fluent right away.”

**[Check out these teaching tips](http://www.code.org/files/CSTT_IntroducingCS.PDF)**

**What to do if a student finishes early?**

  * Students can see all tutorials and try another Hour of Code activity at [<%= resolve_url('code.org/learn') %>](<%= resolve_url('https://code.org/learn') %>)
  * Or, ask students who finish early to help classmates who are having trouble with the activity.

## What comes after the Hour of Code?

The Hour of Code is just the first step on a journey to learn more about how technology works and how to create software applications. To continue this journey:

  * Encourage students to continue to [learn online](<%= resolve_url('https://code.org/learn/beyond') %>).
  * [Attend](<%= resolve_url('https://code.org/professional-development-workshops') %>) a 1-day, in-person workshop to receive instruction from an experienced computer science facilitator. (US educators only)
