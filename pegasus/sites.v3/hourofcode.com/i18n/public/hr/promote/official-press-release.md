  <strong>DATE</strong> - [<strong>INSERT NAME</strong>] joined the principal and faculty members of [<strong>INSERT NAME OF SCHOOL</strong>], business leaders and local families today for [<strong>NAME OF EVENT</strong>] to participate in the Hour of Code as part of Computer Science Education Week .

  [<strong>INSERT DETAILS OF EVENT, USE DESCRIPTIVE AND QUANTIFIABLE LANGUAGE. FOR EXAMPLE:</strong>]<br /> “Daniels Run Elementary school held a school-wide Hour of Code event to expose its students to computer science.

And a dozen parents and volunteers from the community helped with the day and brought the kids together for an assembly showcasing why computer science matters in the lives of these students.”

<p>
  [<strong>SAMPLE STOCK TEXT FOR CONTEXT:</strong>]<br /> Computers are everywhere, but fewer schools teach computer science than 10 years ago. Girls and students of color are severely underrepresented. The good news is we’re changing this for the better. The Hour of Code is gateway toward providing all students with access to high-quality computer science education.
</p>

<p>
  Over 100 million students worldwide have already tried an Hour of Code. Thanks to the Hour of Code, computer science was on homepages of Google, MSN, Yahoo! and Disney. President Obama, Shakira and Ashton Kutcher all kicked off the Hour of Code with videos. Over 100 partners came together to support this movement.
