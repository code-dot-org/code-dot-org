# How to bring the Hour of Code to your entire school district.

## Neka svaka škola sudjeluje, a svaki student uči!

  1. **Recruit local schools.** Share [this email](<%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#sample-emails') %>) and [teacher how to guide](<%= resolve_url('/how-to') %>), or include a [short blurb](<%= resolve_url('/promote/stats') %>) in newsletters/district communications.

  2. **Provide a sample logistics plan for schools.** Share this [sample logistics plan](<%= localized_file('/files/HOC_Logistics_plan.pdf') %>) with schools to give them ideas of how to organize whole school participation. Lako je to uraditi, baš kao na satu matematike, školskom odmoru ili proširiti vijest tijekom tjedna uz pomoć računalna u učionici informatike. They can submit their own plan for a chance to win $10,000 in hardware at [http://hourofcode.com/prizes](<%= resolve_url('/prizes/hardware-signup') %>).

  3. **Podjeli na društvenim medijima.** Objavi na [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fhourofcode.com%2Fus) ili [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhourofcode.com&text=I%27m%20participating%20in%20this%20year%27s%20%23HourOfCode%2C%20are%20you%3F%20%40codeorg&original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fq%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Ftwitter.com%252Fshare%253Fhashtags%253D%2526amp%253Brelated%253Dcodeorg%2526amp%253Btext%253DI%252527m%252Bparticipating%252Bin%252Bthis%252Byear%252527s%252B%252523HourOfCode%25252C%252Bare%252Byou%25253F%252B%252540codeorg%2526amp%253Burl%253Dhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fhourofcode.com%26sa%3DD%26sntz%3D1%26usg%3DAFQjCNE1GLTUbKZfMlEh9Aj5w0iswz6PYQ&related=codeorg&hashtags=). Or share one of these inspirational [pictures and quotes](<%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#social') %>) from world leaders, or [stats](<%= resolve_url('/promote/stats') %>).

  4. **Promote on your district’s homepage.** Let visitors know about your participation and Hour of Code events. Link it to [Hour of Code](<%= resolve_url('/') %>).

  5. **Host a district Hour of Code event.** See our [event how to guide](<%= resolve_url('/how-to/events') %>) for a sample run of show, media outreach kit and other supports.

  6. **More [prizes](<%= resolve_url('/prizes') %>) for EVERY organizer.** Every participating educator will receive thank you gifts, while supplies last. U svakoj saveznoj državi, jedan će razred osvojiti tehnologiju u vrijednosti 10 tisuća dolara za svoju školu!

## Što poslije Sata Kodiranja?

Sat Kodiranja je samo prvi korak na putu da bismo saznali više o načinu funkcioniranja tehnologije i kako napraviti softver aplikacije. To continue this journey: - The Hour of Code is just the first step on a journey to learn more about how technology works and how to create software applications. To continue this journey:

  * Encourage students to continue to [learn online](<%= resolve_url('https://code.org/learn/beyond') %>).
  * [Attend](<%= resolve_url('https://code.org/professional-development-workshops') %>) a 1-day, in-person workshop to receive instruction from an experienced computer science facilitator. (US educators only)
