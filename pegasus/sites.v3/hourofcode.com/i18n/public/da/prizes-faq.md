## Kan ikke-amerikanske skoler vinde videochat præmien?

No, unfortunately, because of logistics we are unable to offer the video chat prize to schools outside of the U.S. and Canada.

## Hvorfor kan præmien på $10.000 hardware kun vindes af offentlige skoler i USA?

We would love to help teachers in public and private schools alike, but at this time, it comes down to logistics. We have partnered with [DonorsChoose.org](http://donorschoose.org) to administer classroom funding prizes, which only works with public, US K-12 schools. According to DonorsChoose.org, the organization is better able to access consistent and accurate data that's available for public schools.

## Jeg bor uden for USA. Kan jeg vinde nogen af præmierne?

Due to a small full-time staff, Code.org is unable to handle the logistics of administering international prizes. Because of this people outside the US are unable to qualify for prizes.
