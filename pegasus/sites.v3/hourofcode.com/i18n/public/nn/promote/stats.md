### Bring datavitskap til skulen. Start med ei kodetime

Datamaskiner er overalt, men færre skular underviser i programmering no enn for 10 år sidan. Den gode nyheita er at me arbeider for å endre dette. If you heard about the [Hour of Code](<%= resolve_url('/') %>) last year, you might know it made history. In the first Hour of Code, 15 million students tried computer science. Last year, that number increased to 60 million students! The [Hour of Code](<%= resolve_url('/') %>) is a one-hour introduction to computer science, designed to demystify code and show that anybody can learn the basics. [Sign up](<%= resolve_url('/') %>) to host an Hour of Code this <%= campaign_date('full') %> during Computer Science Education Week.
