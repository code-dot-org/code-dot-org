# Takk for at du melde deg som vert for Kodetimen!

<br /> **The Hour of Code runs during {{ campaign_date/full }} and we'll be in touch about new tutorials and other exciting updates as they come out. In the meantime, what can you do now?**

As a special thank you to Hour of Code organizers, we have a new poster set featuring Malala, Stephen Curry, Shakira and more available to order at a [50% discount from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/promocode/A3QAYNZUZTSSNQ). This year, each set comes with 6 posters and 126 "I did the Hour of Code" stickers. With the discount you'll get them for less than our cost to make them. Supplies are limited, so order your posters soon. If you're not in the United States, you can [download and print all posters]({{ promote/promote_posters_url }}).

## 1. Spre budskapet på din lokale skole og i nærmiljøet

You just joined the Hour of Code movement. Tell your friends with **#HourOfCode**!

{{ social_media_hoc }} <br /> Encourage others to participate [with our sample emails.]({{ promote/sample_emails }}) Contact your principal and challenge every classroom at your school to sign up. Recruit a local group — boy/girl scouts club, church, university, veterans group, labor union, or even some friends. Du treng ikkje gå på skulen for å lære noko nytt. Invite a local politician or policy maker to visit your school for the Hour of Code. Dette kan hjelpe å bygge støtte til informatikkopplæring i ditt område ut over ein Kodetime.

Use these [posters, banners, stickers, videos and more]({{ promote/resources }}) for your own event.

## 2. Finn en lokal frivillig som kan hjelpe deg med arrangementet.

[Search our volunteer map]({{ urls/volunteer_local }}) for volunteers who can visit your classroom or video chat remotely to inspire your students about the breadth of possibilities with computer science.

## 3. Planlegging av Kodetimen

Choose an [Hour of Code activity](https://hourofcode.com/learn) for your classroom and [review this how-to guide]({{ urls/how_to_guide }}).

### 4. Stock up on swag

Order materials to help get students excited about your event by heading to the Code.org [Amazon store](https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/8557B2A6-EBF2-4C9F-95C5-C3256FBA0220). [Order posters](https://www.amazon.com/promocode/A3QAYNZUZTSSNQ) (and get an extra 50% off), Hour of Code kits, stickers, and more! But hurry, supplies are limited.
