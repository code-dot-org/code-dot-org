## Key Tips

- मिडियाको इमेलको माध्यम तपाइँको घटना भन्दा पहिले दो सप्ताह बाहिर सम्म जानुहोस्। यदि तपाइँले प्रारम्भिक प्रतिक्रिया प्राप्त गर्नुभएको छैन भने इमेल र फोनद्वारा पछ्याउनुहोस्।
- विद्यालयको कर्मचारी सदस्य वा स्वयंसेवकलाई अनलाइन साझा गर्न फोटोहरू लिन वा प्रेसमा पठाउन सोध्नुहोस्।
- तपाइँको वेबसाइटको गृहपृष्ठ र तपाइँको विद्यालयको समाचारपत्रमा Hour of Code को बारेमा लेख्नुहोस्, र तपाइँको घटनाको विवरणहरू, र र विद्यार्थीको गतिविधिका तस्विर पोस्ट गर्नुहोस्।
- On Facebook and Twitter, share updates on your plans, announce your events, and post pictures during <%= campaign_date('year') %>. Use the hashtag **#HourOfCode** so Code.org can see and promote your events.

## Step-by-step guide

### 1. Plan your event

- Hour of Code को सुरु गर्न सभाको योजना बनाउनुहोस्।
- Send [a letter](<%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#sample-emails') %>) to parents and ask them to spread the word.
- Send [a letter](<%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#sample-emails') %>) to invite your local mayor, member of Congress, governor, or influential businessperson to attend and speak to your students.
- समूहको गतिविधिहरूलाई ('अनप्लग्ड' प्रोग्रामिङ्को गतिविधिको प्रदर्शन जस्तै) आयोजना गर्नुहोस्, वा विद्यार्थी-बनाइयो र नेतृत्व गर्ने गतिविधिहरू बन्द देखियो।
- Show Code.org’s [Hour of Code video](<%= resolve_url('/') %>) or one of [these videos](<%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#videos') %>) to inspire students. <br />

### 2. Identify specific reporters that cover education or local events

Like local newspapers, TV station or radio stations, or blogs. <br />

### 3. Contact local media

The best way to reach out is by email. It should be short and should communicate "why should other people care about this event"? Include contact information (including a cellphone number) for who will be on site at the event. **[See a sample pitch to media](<%= resolve_url('/promote/press-kit#sample-emails') %>)**.

Look online to find reporter contact information. If you can't find it, call the publication to ask, or email the organization's general email address and ask for your message to be directed to the correct reporter. <br />

### 4. Prepare to field questions about your school event. Here are some examples:

#### Why is your school doing an Hour of Code?

While all of us know that it’s important for students to learn how to navigate today’s tech-saturated world, many teachers aren’t experienced in computer science and don’t know where to start. This event is a chance for all of us to see what computer science is about.

We hope it’ll spark interest in students to keep learning. Research also shows that kids can pick up programming concepts before they know how to read and write. In fact, their brains are more receptive to computer languages at a young age, just like foreign languages. <br /> <br />

#### Why is this important?

Technology is transforming every industry on the planet. In 2015, 7 million openings in the U.S. were in occupations—including art and design—that value coding skills. But 60 percent of schools in the U.S. don't teach computer science. It’s time for us to catch up to the 21st-century. We know that regardless of what our students do when they grow up, whether they go into medicine, business, politics, or the arts, knowing how to build technology will give them confidence and a competitive edge. <br />

## Sample email to send to invite local media to your event

**Subject line**: Local school joins mission to introduce students to computer science

Computers are everywhere, changing every industry on the planet, but fewer than half of all schools teach computer science. Girls and minorities are severely underrepresented in computer science classes, and in the tech industry. राम्रो खबर हो, हामीले हाम्रो बाटोबाट यसलाई परिवर्तन गरि राखेका छौँ।

With the Hour of Code, computer science has been on homepages of Google, MSN, Yahoo!, and Disney. Over 100 partners have joined together to support this movement. Every Apple Store in the world has hosted an Hour of Code. Even President Obama wrote his first line of code as part of the campaign.

That’s why every one of the [X number] students at [SCHOOL NAME] are joining in on the largest learning event in history: The Hour of Code, during Computer Science Education Week (December 3-9).

I'm writing to invite you to attend our kickoff assembly and to see kids start the activity on [DATE].

The Hour of Code, organized by the nonprofit Code.org and over 100 others, is a global movement that believes the students of today are ready to learn critical skills for 21st-century success. Please join us.
