## तपाइँको Hour of Code को घटनामा मिडियालाई कसरी आकर्षित गर्ने

*For all press and media inquiries, contact <press@code.org>*

### मुख्य उपायहरू

- मिडियाको इमेलको माध्यम तपाइँको घटना भन्दा पहिले दो सप्ताह बाहिर सम्म जानुहोस्। यदि तपाइँले प्रारम्भिक प्रतिक्रिया प्राप्त गर्नुभएको छैन भने इमेल र फोनद्वारा पछ्याउनुहोस्।
- विद्यालयको कर्मचारी सदस्य वा स्वयंसेवकलाई अनलाइन साझा गर्न फोटोहरू लिन वा प्रेसमा पठाउन सोध्नुहोस्।
- तपाइँको वेबसाइटको गृहपृष्ठ र तपाइँको विद्यालयको समाचारपत्रमा Hour of Code को बारेमा लेख्नुहोस्, र तपाइँको घटनाको विवरणहरू, र र विद्यार्थीको गतिविधिका तस्विर पोस्ट गर्नुहोस्।
- On Facebook and Twitter, share updates on your plans, announce your events and post pictures during Dec. 5-11. Use the hashtag **#HourOfCode** so Code.org can see and promote your events.

### पालै-पालो मार्गदर्शन गर्न:

**1. Plan your event**

- Hour of Code को सुरु गर्न सभाको योजना बनाउनुहोस्।
- Send [a letter](<%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#sample-emails') %>) to parents. Ask them to spread the word.
- Send [a letter](<%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#sample-emails') %>) to invite your local mayor, congressman, governor, or influential businessperson to attend and speak to your students.
- समूहको गतिविधिहरूलाई ('अनप्लग्ड' प्रोग्रामिङ्को गतिविधिको प्रदर्शन जस्तै) आयोजना गर्नुहोस्, वा विद्यार्थी-बनाइयो र नेतृत्व गर्ने गतिविधिहरू बन्द देखियो।
- Show Code.org’s [Hour of Code video](<%= resolve_url('/') %>) or one of [these](<%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#videos') %>) to inspire.

**2. Identify specific local reporters that cover education or local events.**

Think a local newspaper, TV station, radio station or blog.

Look online to find reporter contact information. If you can't find it, call the publication to ask, or email a general tips@PUBLICATIONNAME.com email address and ask for your message to be directed to the correct reporter.

**3. Contact local media**

The best way to reach out is by email. It should be short and communicate: why should other people care about this event? Include contact information (including a cellphone number) for who will be on site at the event. **See a [sample pitch to media](<%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#sample-emails') %>).**

**4. Prepare to field questions about your school event. Here are some examples:**

*Why is your school doing an Hour of Code?*

While all of us know that it’s important for students to learn how to navigate today’s tech-saturated world, many teachers aren’t experienced in computer science and don’t know where to start. This event is a chance for all of us to see what computer science is about.

We hope it’ll spark interest in students to keep learning. Research also shows that kids can pick up programming concepts before they know how to read and write. In fact, their brains are more receptive to computer languages at a young age, just like foreign languages.

*Why is this important?*

Technology is transforming every industry on the planet. In 2015, 7 million openings in the U.S. were in occupations—including art and design—that value coding skills. But 75 percent of schools in the U.S. don't teach computer science. It’s time for us to catch up to the 21st century. We know that regardless of what our students do when they grow up, whether they go into medicine, business, politics, or the arts, knowing how to build technology will give them confidence and a competitive edge.

**More details and a quote you can use in materials**

"The Hour of Code is designed to demystify code and show that computer science is not rocket science—anybody can learn the basics," said Hadi Partovi, founder and CEO of Code.org. "Over 100 million students worldwide have tried an Hour of Code. The demand for relevant 21st century computer science education crosses all borders and knows no boundaries."

**About Code.org**

Code.org is a 501c3 public non-profit dedicated to expanding participation in computer science and increasing participation by women and underrepresented students of color.
