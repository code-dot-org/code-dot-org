## सबै विद्याथी, सबै सहभागीले ,

### 1. Read our one-pager

See [why computer science education is important](/files/hoc-one-pager.pdf), and how you can help the effort by supporting the Hour of Code.

### 2. Recruit local schools and districts

Use [this email](<%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#sample-emails') %>) or [this blurb](<%= resolve_url('/promote/stats') %>) as a starting point, and take a look at this [how-to](<%= resolve_url('/how-to') %>) for schools and districts.

### 3. Host an Hour of Code event

See our [event how-to guide](<%= resolve_url('/how-to/events') %>) for a sample run of show, [media outreach kit](<%= resolve_url('/promote/press-kit') %>), and other event-planning resources. Hosting an event is a great way to promote the Hour of Code and increase participation.

### 4. Attend an event during Computer Science Education Week (<%= campaign_date('short') %>)

[Find classrooms and schools](<%= resolve_url('/events') %>) participating in your district, city, or state.

### 5. Issue a proclamation or resolution

See this [sample resolution](<%= resolve_url('resources/proclamation') %>) supportive of Computer Science Education Week and its goals that could be used by state and local legislators.

### 6. Draft an op-ed

Consider publishing an opinion piece in your local paper. See this [sample op-ed](<%= resolve_url('/promote/op-ed') %>) supporting Computer Science Education Week and its goals.

### 7. Spread the word

[Share the Hour of Code video on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fhourofcode.com%2Fus) and [talk about your support on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhourofcode.com&text=I%27m%20participating%20in%20this%20year%27s%20%23HourOfCode%2C%20are%20you%3F%20%40codeorg&original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fq%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Ftwitter.com%252Fshare%253Fhashtags%253D%2526amp%253Brelated%253Dcodeorg%2526amp%253Btext%253DI%252527m%252Bparticipating%252Bin%252Bthis%252Byear%252527s%252B%252523HourOfCode%25252C%252Bare%252Byou%25253F%252B%252540codeorg%2526amp%253Burl%253Dhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fhourofcode.com%26sa%3DD%26sntz%3D1%26usg%3DAFQjCNE1GLTUbKZfMlEh9Aj5w0iswz6PYQ&related=codeorg&hashtags=). Share pictures of events or a video of you and other adults doing the Hour of Code. Use the hashtag **#HourOfCode** so Code.org (@code.org) can see it and promote the support. Or, use these sample tweets:

- *Every student, boy or girl, should have the chance to learn computer science. Join us in starting with one #HourOfCode [https://hourofcode.com](<%= resolve_url('/') %>)*
- *Today, we're proud to join the Hour of Code movement. Are you in? #HourOfCode [https://hourofcode.com](<%= resolve_url('/') %>)*

### 8. Issue a press release

[Use this sample](<%= resolve_url('/promote/official-press-release') %>) as a guide.

### 9. Connect locally

[Learn more about computer science education in your state](<%= codeorg_url('/advocacy') %>). Sign the petition there and you’ll get updates on Code.org's local, state, and federal advocacy efforts.
