# 賞品 - よくあるご質問

## 1万ドル相当のハードウェアの懸賞に申し込むには学校全体での参加が必要ですか？

Yes. Your whole school has to participate to be eligible for the prize but only one person needs to register and submit the Hardware Prize application form [here](<%= resolve_url('/prizes') %>).

## 公立学校でなくてもビデオ会議賞の応募資格がありますか？

## 米国以外の学校はビデオチャット賞をもらうことができますか？

No, unfortunately, because of logistics we are unable to offer the video chat prize to schools outside of the U.S. and Canada.

## なぜ1万ドルのハードウェア賞は公立学校だけが対象なのですか？

We would love to help teachers in public and private schools alike, but at this time, it comes down to logistics. We have partnered with [DonorsChoose.org](http://donorschoose.org) to administer classroom funding prizes, which only works with public, US K-12 schools. According to DonorsChoose.org, the organization is better able to access consistent and accurate data that's available for public schools.

## 私は米国外に住んでますが、賞への応募資格はありますか？

Due to a small full-time staff, Code.org is unable to handle the logistics of administering international prizes. Because of this people outside the US are unable to qualify for prizes.

## If my whole school can’t do the Hour of Code during Computer Science Education Week (Dec. 7-13), can I still qualify for prizes?

Yes, just be sure to submit a logistics plan that outlines how your whole school is participating over a reasonable length of time and register for the Hour of Code by November 16th.
