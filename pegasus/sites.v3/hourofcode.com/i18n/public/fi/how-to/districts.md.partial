# How to involve your entire school district

### Every school in your district can take part in the largest learning event in history.

* * *

## Get every school participating, every student learning!

### 1. Saa paikalliset koulut mukaasi

Share [this email]({{ promote/sample_emails }}) and [teacher how to guide]({{ urls/how_to_guide }}), or include a [short blurb]({{ promote/stats_url }}) in newsletters/district communications. <br />

### 2. Provide a sample logistics plan for schools

Share this [sample logistics plan]({{ hoc_logistics_plan }}) with schools to give them ideas of how to organize whole school participation. It’s as easy as doing it in every math class, homeroom period, or rotating throughout the week through the computer lab.

Or share one of these inspirational [pictures and quotes]({{ promote/resources_social }}) from world leaders, or [stats]({{ promote/stats_url }}).

### 4. Promote on your district’s homepage

Let visitors know about your participation and Hour of Code events. Link it to [Hour of Code]({{ urls/home }}).

### 5. Host a district Hour of Code event

See our [event how to guide]({{ urls/how_to_events }}) for a sample run of show, media outreach kit, and other supports.

## Mitä koodaustunnin jälkeen?

The Hour of Code is just the first step on a journey to learn more about how technology works and how to create software applications. To continue this journey:

- Encourage students to continue to [learn online]({{ urls/learn_beyond }}).
- [Attend]({{ urls/professional_development_workshops }}) a 1-day, in-person workshop to receive instruction from an experienced computer science facilitator. (US educators only)
