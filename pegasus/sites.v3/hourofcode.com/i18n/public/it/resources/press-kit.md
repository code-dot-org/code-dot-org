## Come attirare l'attenzione dei media sul tuo evento dell'Ora del Codice

*For all press and media inquiries, contact <press@code.org>*

### Suggerimenti Importanti

  * Mettiti in contatto con i media due settimane prima dell'evento via e-mail. Se non ricevi una risposta, riprova via e-mail oppure via telefono.
  * Chiedi ad un volontario oppure a un collaboratore della scuola di scattare fotografie da condividere online o trasmettere ai giornali.
  * Scrivi dell'Ora del Codice sulla homepage del sito web della scuola e sul giornale scolastico. &Egrave; utile arricchire i testi con dettagli sugli eventi e con foto delle attività svolte dagli studenti.
  * Condividi, annuncia gli eventi e posta le foto dal 7 al 13 Dicembre su Twitter e Facebook. Usa l'hashtag **#HourOfCode** in modo che Code.org possa visualizzare e promuovere i tuoi eventi.

### Guida passo-passo:

**1. Plan your event**

  * Organizza una assemblea per promuovere l'Ora del Codice.
  * Send [a letter](<%= resolve_url('/resources/#sample-emails') %>) to parents. Ask them to spread the word.
  * Send [a letter](<%= resolve_url('/resources/#sample-emails') %>) to invite your local mayor, congressman, governor, or influential businessperson to attend and speak to your students.
  * Organizza attività di gruppo (come una dimostrazione oppure un'attività di programmazione offline), oppure organizza un'esibizione di attività svolte od organizzate dagli studenti.
  * Show Code.org’s [Hour of Code video](<%= resolve_url('/') %>) or one of [these](<%= resolve_url('/resources#videos') %>) to inspire.

**2. Identify specific local reporters that cover education or local events.**

Think a local newspaper, TV station, radio station or blog.

Look online to find reporter contact information. If you can't find it, call the publication to ask, or email a general tips@PUBLICATIONNAME.com email address and ask for your message to be directed to the correct reporter.

**3. Contact local media**

The best way to reach out is by email. It should be short and communicate: why should other people care about this event? Include contact information (including a cellphone number) for who will be on site at the event. **See a [sample pitch to media](<%= resolve_url('/resources#sample-emails') %>):**

**4. Prepare to field questions about your school event. Here are some examples:**

*Why is your school doing an Hour of Code?*

While all of us know that it’s important for students to learn how to navigate today’s tech-saturated world, many teachers aren’t experienced in computer science and don’t know where to start. This event is a chance for all of us to see what computer science is about.

We hope it’ll spark interest in students to keep learning. Research also shows that kids pick up programming concepts before they know how to read and write. In fact, their brains are more receptive to computer languages at a young age, just like foreign languages.

*Why is this important?*

In China, every students takes computer science to graduate high school. In the U.S., 90 percent of schools don’t even teach it. It’s time for us to catch up to the 21st century. We know that regardless of what our students do when they grow up, whether they go into medicine, business, politics, or the arts, knowing how to build technology will give them the confidence and know-how to succeed.

**More details and a quote you can use in materials**

"The Hour of Code is designed to demystify code and show that computer science is not rocket-science, anybody can learn the basics," said Hadi Partovi, founder and CEO of Code.org. "Over 100 million students worldwide have tried an Hour of Code. The demand for relevant 21st century computer science education crosses all borders and knows no boundaries."
