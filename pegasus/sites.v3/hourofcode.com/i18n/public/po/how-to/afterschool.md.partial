# Como ensinar uma Hora de Código em atividades extracurriculares ou em clubes

### Join the movement and introduce your students to computer science with these steps.

Computational thinking helps nurture problem-solving skills, logic, and creativity. And technology is transforming every industry on the planet. Students today should learn how to create technology, not just use it. By starting early, they’ll have a foundation for success in any 21st-century career path.

Trying an Hour of Code is a simple and fun way to introduce students to computer science, perhaps for the very first time. If you'd like an extra set of hands to help out, you can find a [local volunteer]({{ urls/volunteer_local }}) to help run an Hour of Code in your after-school class or club.

### An Hour of Code can also be hosted remotely! To get started, check out our [tips for hosting a virtual Hour of Code event](https://hourofcode.com/us/how-to/virtual).

## 1. Assista a este vídeo prático <iframe width="500" height="255" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/SrnvvWDm73k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen mark="crwd-mark"></iframe> 

## 2. Selecione um tutorial

We provide a variety of [fun, hour-long tutorials]({{ urls/learn }}) for participants all ages, created by a variety of partners. [Try them out!]({{ urls/learn }})

**All Hour of Code tutorials** require minimal prep-time for organizers, and are self-guided - allowing kids to work at their own pace and skill-level.

**Need a lesson plan for your afterschool Hour of Code?** Check out this [template](/files/AfterschoolEducatorLessonPlanOutline.docx)!

## 3. Promova a sua Hora de Código

Promote your Hour of Code [with these tools]({{ urls/promote }}) and encourage others to host their own events.

## 4. Planeie a suas necessidades de hardware - os computadores são opcionais

Um computador com ligação à Internet assegura a melhor experiência da Hora de Código. But you **don’t** need a computer for every child, and you can even do the Hour of Code without a computer at all.

Make sure to test tutorials on student computers or devices to ensure they work properly on browsers with sound and video. **Have low bandwidth?** Plan to show videos at the front of the class, so each student isn't downloading their own videos. Or try the unplugged / offline tutorials.

Provide headphones for your class, or ask students to bring their own, if the tutorial you choose works best with sound.

**Don't have enough devices?** Use [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q). When students partner up, they help each other and rely less on the teacher. Eles irão perceber que a ciência computacional é uma atividade social e colaborativa.

## 5. Start your Hour of Code off with an inspiring video

Comece seu evento da Hora de Código inspirando os participantes e discutindo o impacto da ciência computacional em cada situação das nossas vidas.

**Show an inspirational video:**

- The original Code.org launch video, featuring Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and NBA star Chris Bosh - there are [1 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYZF6oIZtfc), [5 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc), and [9 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1xS07N-FA) versions available.
- The [Hour of Code Worldwide video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsOIlDT145A)
- [O presidente Obama apela a que todos os alunos aprendam ciência computacional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvmhE1J9PY).
- Find more inspirational videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNfpD8i4Sx7U0y2MccnrNZuP).

**It’s okay if you are all brand new to computer science. Here are some ideas to introduce your Hour of Code activity:**

- Explain ways technology impacts our lives, with examples both boys and girls will care about (Talk about apps and technology that is used to save lives, help people, connect people etc).
- List things that use code in everyday life.
- See tips for getting girls interested in computer science [here]({{ urls/girls }}).

**Need more guidance?** Download this [template lesson plan](/files/AfterschoolEducatorLessonPlanOutline.docx).

## 6. Code!

**Direct participants to the activity** - Write the tutorial link on a whiteboard. Find the link listed on the [information for your selected tutorial]({{ urls/learn }}) under the number of participants.

**When someone comes across difficulties it's okay to respond:** - “I don’t know. Let’s figure this out together.” - “Technology doesn’t always work out the way we want.” - “Learning to program is like learning a new language; you won’t be fluent right away.”

**What to do if someone finishes early?** - Encourage participants to try another Hour of Code activity at [hourofcode.com/learn]({{ urls/learn }}) - Or, ask those who finish early to help others who are having trouble.

## 7. Celebrar

- [Print certificates]({{ urls/certificates }}) for your students.
- [Print "I did an Hour of Code!"]({{ promote/resources_stickers }}) stickers for your students.
- [Order custom t-shirts](http://blog.code.org/post/132608499493/hour-of-code-shirts-and-more) for participants.
- Share photos and videos of your Hour of Code event on social media. Use #HourOfCode and @codeorg so we can highlight your success, too!
