# Guia prático para Voluntários

## Porquê voluntariar-se?

Consulte alguns testemunhos de voluntários no passado:

- "A melhor parte da minha experiência foi que a turma inteira eram mulheres e pessoas de cor. É um bom augúrio para o futuro da nossa indústria ter uma chance de alcançar e entusiasmar estas crianças."
- “Especially enjoyed getting to encourage young girls in technology. Felt like I was helping the next generation in my local area.”
- “I LOVED seeing how excited the kids were. Uma coisa fantástica foi que os professores notaram que alguns dos estudantes que não eram tão bons academicamente estavam a executar com excelência o pensamento como programador ou a ajudar outros - dando-lhes um local para se sentirem confiantes."

Visit a local classroom to inspire students to keep learning computer science. [Sign up now!](https://code.org/volunteer/engineer).

## Recruit your co-workers to volunteer

Tell your friends and co-workers about the Hour of Code. We have thousands of teachers signing up and looking for volunteers, so ask them to [sign up as a volunteer](https://code.org/volunteer). Ask your employer to get involved. [Send this email](https://hourofcode.com/promote/resources#email) to your manager, or the CEO.

## How you get selected

- Teachers will be searching for volunteers on our [volunteer map](https://code.org/volunteer/local).
- Teachers will be reviewing your profiles on the map, so try to make your profile as complete as possible to increase the chance that a teacher will select you.
- A teacher will contact you through this form (your email address will never be shared with the teacher). 
  - If you are receiving too many requests from teachers, you can always update your preferences by clicking the link to edit your information or unsubscribe, provided at the bottom of any email from a teacher. 

## How to prepare
