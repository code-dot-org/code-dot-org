“Daniels Run Elementary school held a school-wide Hour of Code event to introduce its students to computer science. More than 700 students from all grades did at least one Hour of Code.

[**SAMPLE STOCK TEXT FOR CONTEXT:**]  
Computers are everywhere, but fewer schools teach computer science than 10 years ago. Girls and students of color are severely underrepresented. The good news is we’re changing this for the better.

Over 100 million students worldwide have already tried an Hour of Code. Thanks to the Hour of Code, computer science was on homepages of Google, MSN, Yahoo!, and Disney. President Obama, Shakira, and Ashton Kutcher have all kicked off the Hour of Code with videos. Over 100 partners came together to support this movement. <br />

[**INSERT QUOTE FROM SPOKESPERSON, EXAMPLE BELOW:**]
