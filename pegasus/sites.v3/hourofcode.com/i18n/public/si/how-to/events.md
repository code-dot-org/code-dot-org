# How to organize an Hour of Code event

## 1. Prepare for your event

- Determine a venue, date, and time.
- Send [a letter](https://docs.google.com/a/code.org/document/d/1eP41sKW7y0qq_JvkRIgZK8dWYICaGRZ4CCDETXa78wY/edit) to invite your local mayor, congressman, governor, or influential business person to speak. Check out our [how-to toolkit](<%=resolve_url('/files/elected-official.pdf')%>) when hosting an elected official during an Hour of Code for more info.
- Invite media/press. i.e. local news station, newspaper, education/tech bloggers. See our [press kit](<%= resolve_url('/promote/press-kit') %>) for help.

## 2. During your event

- Kick off your event with one of our [inspirational videos](<%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#videos') %>).
- Give an intro overviewing the importance of computer science, using these [stats and infographics](<%= resolve_url('/promote/stats') %>).   
      
    
- Other event ideas: 
    - Invite a local industry leader to discuss his or her work involving computer science.
    - Invite a local politician and have students teach him or her how to code.
    - Have a group of students demonstrate an unplugged activity.
    - Have a group of students teach the principal or a group of teachers how to code.
    - If your school already teaches computer science, have students demo projects.

## 3. Share how it went

- Share pictures of your event on Facebook and Twitter. 
- Use the hashtag **#HourOfCode**

## Host a Family Code Night with the Hour of Code and invite parents to participate

Consider hosting a K-5 evening event and inviting parents to join their students for an hour of computer science. This is a great way to engage the larger community and encourage parent support for computer science at your school. Our partners at Family Code Night have created an all-in-one Event Kit with planning checklist, presenter’s script, invitation emails, posters, powerpoints and more to run your own event. [Click here to download the Event Kit](http://www.familycodenight.org/DownloadCodeDotOrg.html).
