## Moet uw hele school meedoen om $10.000 aan hardware te verdienen?

Yes. Your whole school has to participate to be eligible for the prize but only one person needs to register and submit the Hardware Prize application form [here](<%= resolve_url('/prizes/hardware-signup') %>). Every teacher participating will need to [sign up](<%= resolve_url('/') %>) their classroom individually in order to receive the all organizer thank you gift.

## Who is eligible to win the $10,000 in hardware?

Alleen voor scholen in het basis- en middelbaar onderwijs. To qualify, your entire school must register for the Hour of Code by November 16, 2015. Een school in iedere Amerikaanse staat krijgt computers voor een heel klaslokaal. Code.org will select and notify winners via email by December 1, 2015.

## Waarom is de prijs van $10.000 hardware alleen beschikbaar voor openbare scholen?

We would love to help teachers in public and private schools alike, but at this time, it comes down to logistics. We have partnered with [DonorsChoose.org](http://donorschoose.org) to administer classroom funding prizes, which only works with public, US K-12 schools. According to DonorsChoose.org, the organization is better able to access consistent and accurate data that's available for public schools.

## When is the deadline to apply for the hardware prize?

To qualify, you must complete the [Hardware Application form](<%= resolve_url('/prizes/hardware-signup') %>) by November 16, 2015. Een school in iedere Amerikaanse staat krijgt computers voor een heel klaslokaal. Code.org will select and notify winners via email by December 1, 2015.
