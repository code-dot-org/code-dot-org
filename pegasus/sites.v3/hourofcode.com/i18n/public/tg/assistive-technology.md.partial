# Completing an Hour of Code with Assistive Technology

Anyone can try an Hour of Code during Computer Science Education Week.

## Using Screen Readers

If you use a screen reader, the [Quorum tutorial for beginners](https://quorumlanguage.com/hourofcode/astro1.html) or the [Quorum tutorial for comfortable students](https://quorumlanguage.com/hourofcode/part1.html) are great places to start an Hour of Code. Quorum started as an interpreted language originally designed to be accessible through screen readers. It has become a general purpose programming language designed for any user. And, if you want to go beyond an Hour of Code, the team at Quorum has additional tools and curriculum.

## Code.org Tutorials Without Audio

The [Code.org tutorials](https://studio.code.org/courses) can all be used with or without sound. All the videos have captions.

## Pair Programming

Pair programming is a tool computer scientists use to solve problems as a pair or team. Try working on Hour of Code challenges with a friend or classmate. Donâ€™t forget to [check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q) to learn the best techniques for pair programming.
