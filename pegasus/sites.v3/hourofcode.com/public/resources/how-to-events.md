Hour of Code Event How to Guide
====

Host an Hour of Code event during Computer Science Education Week (Dec 8-14) to celebrate computer science and inspire more students to try it. Anyone, anywhere can organize an Hour of Code event. 

## 1) Prepare for your event
- Determine a venue, date and time
- Send <a href="<%= hoc_uri('https://docs.google.com/a/code.org/document/d/1eP41sKW7y0qq_JvkRIgZK8dWYICaGRZ4CCDETXa78wY/edit') %>">a letter</a> to invite your local mayor, congressman, governor, or influential business person to speak.
- Invite media/press. i.e. local news station, newspaper, education/tech bloggers. See our <a href="<%= hoc_uri('/resources/press-kit') %>">press kit</a> for help.

## 2) During your event

- Kick off your event with one of our <a href="<%= hoc_uri('/resources#videos') %>">inspirational videos</a>.
- Give an intro overviewing the importance of computer science.
	- Discuss these  <a href="<%= hoc_uri('/resources/stats') %>">statistics</a>. 
	- Show these <a href="<%= hoc_uri('/resources/stats') %>">infographics</a>.
	<br/>
	<br/>
- Other event ideas:
	- Invite a local industry leader to discuss his or her work involving computer science
	- Invite a local politician and have students teach him or her how to code
	- Watch one of the Q&A sessions with an Hour of Code ambassador. They will all be recorded and on Code.org’s YouTube page. This year’s participants include Bill Gates, Sheryl Sandberg, Ashton Kutcher and more!
	- Have a group of students demonstrate an unplugged activity
	- Have a group of students teach the principal or a group of teachers how to code
	- If your school already teaches computer science, have students demo projects

## 3) Share what you did
- After your event, share testimonies and post pictures of your event on Facebook and Twitter. 
- Use the hashtag #HourofCode so Code.org can see and promote your celebration.
