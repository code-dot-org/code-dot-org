How-to guide for school districts
====

## Bring the Hour of Code to your entire school district. Get every school participating, every student learning!

1. **Recruit local schools.** Share <a href="<%= hoc_uri('/resources#sample-emails') %>">this email</a> and <a href="<%= hoc_uri('/resources/how-to') %>">teacher how to guide</a>, or include a <a href="<%= hoc_uri('/resources/stats') %>">short blurb</a> in newsletters/district communications. 

2. **Provide a sample logistics plan for schools.** Share this sample logistics plan with schools to give them ideas of how to organize whole school participation. It’s as easy as doing it in every math class, homeroom period, or rotating throughout the week through the computer lab. They can submit their own plan for a chance to win $10,000 in hardware at <a href="<%= hoc_uri('/prizes') %>">http://hourofcode.com/prizes</a>.

3. **Share on social media.** Post to [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fhourofcode.com%2Fus) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhourofcode.com&text=I%27m%20participating%20in%20this%20year%27s%20%23HourOfCode%2C%20are%20you%3F%20%40codeorg&original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fq%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Ftwitter.com%252Fshare%253Fhashtags%253D%2526amp%253Brelated%253Dcodeorg%2526amp%253Btext%253DI%252527m%252Bparticipating%252Bin%252Bthis%252Byear%252527s%252B%252523HourOfCode%25252C%252Bare%252Byou%25253F%252B%252540codeorg%2526amp%253Burl%253Dhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fhourofcode.com%26sa%3DD%26sntz%3D1%26usg%3DAFQjCNE1GLTUbKZfMlEh9Aj5w0iswz6PYQ&related=codeorg&hashtags=). Or share one of these inspirational <a href="<%= hoc_uri('/resources#social') %>">pictures and quotes</a> from world leaders, or <a href="<%= hoc_uri('/resources/stats') %>">stats</a>). 

4. **Promote on your district’s homepage.** Add one of these <a href="<%= hoc_uri('/resources#banners') %>">banners</a> to your district’s website to let visitors know about your participation. Link it to [http://hourofcode.com](http://hourofcode.com). 

5. **Host a district Hour of Code event.** See our <a href="<%= hoc_uri('/resources/how-to-event') %>">event how to guide</a> for a sample run of show, media outreach kit and other supports. 

6. **More <a href="<%= hoc_uri('/prizes') %>">prizes</a> for EVERY organizer.** Every participating educator will receive thank you gifts. 100 classrooms will win tech chats with special guest speakers. Participants include Bill Gates, Sheryl Sandberg, Ashton Kutcher and more). And in each state, one participating school will win $10,000 in technology for their school!
