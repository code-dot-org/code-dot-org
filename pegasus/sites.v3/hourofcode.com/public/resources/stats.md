### Bring computer science to your school. Start with an Hour of Code 
Computers are everywhere, but fewer schools teach computer science than 10 years ago. Good news is, weâ€™re on our way to change this. If you heard about the <a href="<%= resolve_url('/') %>">Hour of Code</a> last year, you might know it made history. In the first Hour of Code, 15 million students tried computer science. Last year, that number increased to 60 million students! The <a href="<%= resolve_url('/') %>">Hour of Code</a> is a one-hour introduction to computer science, designed to demystify code and show that anybody can learn the basics. <a href="<%= resolve_url('/') %>">Sign up</a> to host an Hour of Code this <%= campaign_date('full') %> during Computer Science Education Week.
