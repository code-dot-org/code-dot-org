# Tutorial guidelines for the Hour of Code and Computer Science Education Week

Code.org will host a variety of Hour of Code activities on the Code.org, Hour of Code, and CSEdWeek  website(s). The current list is at [code.org/learn](http://code.org/learn).

We’d like to host a variety of engaging options, but the primary goal is to optimize the experience for students and teachers who are new to computer science. Please use this document to guide the creation of your activity, targeted to the user who has no background in coding, computer programming, and computer science.

## How tutorials will be evaluated for inclusion
A committee of computer science educators will rank submissions based on qualitative and quantitative metrics, including survey results from a broader set of educators.

**Tutorials will be listed higher if they are:**

- high quality
- self-directed, don’t require any instruction
- designed for beginners
- designed as a ~ 1 hour activity
- require no sign up 
- require no payment
- require no installation
- work across many OS/device platforms, including mobile and tablets
- work across multiple languages
- promote learning by all demographic groups (esp under-represented groups)
- not pure HTML+CSS web design focus - (our goal is computer science, not just HTML coding)

**Tutorials will be listed lower if they are:**

- lower quality
- more advanced level of teaching (not for beginners)
- have a limited number of supported OS/device platforms - for Web-based platforms you should aim to support all of the following: IE9+, and the latest Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
- work only in English
- have a gender-specific bent (eg thematically aimed primarily at boys)
- serve as an upsell to a learning platform that charges tuition

**Tutorials will NOT be listed if they:**

- require a high degree of involvement by a teacher with lots of prep (ie not self-guided for students)
- are not designed to be a (roughly) one-hour activity
- require sign up 
- require payment
- require installation
- focus only on HTML + CSS web design
- are submitted after the submission deadline, or with incomplete information (see below)

Ultimately, the goal of the Hour of Code campaign is to broaden participation in computer science by students and teachers, and to help show that computer science is accessible to all, and “easier than you think.”  In many ways, this goal is better achieved by giving students and teachers fewer and simpler choices, with a focus on the highest quality options for a first-time user. 

Note also, that the 2013 CSEdWeek was a fantastic success as measured by the responses from teachers and students - 20M participants from Dec 9 - 23, and 97% said they enjoyed it and want to repeat the campaign!! 

As a result, the existing listings are certainly “good enough,” and the driving reason to add tutorials to the Hour of Code listings isn’t to broaden the choices, but to raise the quality (or freshness) for students, or to expand the options for non-English speakers given the global nature of the 2014 campaign.

## General guidelines for creating an Hour of Code activity

- **Subject:** Introductory computer science or programming (not HTML).
- **Goal:** Give beginners an accessible first taste of programming.
- **Tone:** 
	- Computer science is not just for geniuses. It doesn’t matter your age, gender, race. Anybody can learn!
	- Computer science is connected to a wide variety of fields and interests. Everybody should learn!
	- Encourage students to create something that can be shared with friends/online.
- **Types of activities:** 
	- **Best:** Web-based, smartphone-friendly, or unplugged-style activities that teach computer science concepts without the use of a computer (see <http://csunplugged.com/>). 
	- **Okay, but not preferred:** app-install, desktop app, or game-console experiences.
- **Format:** Self-guided tutorials or lessons, optionally facilitated by the teacher. There should be directions for students as opposed to an open-ended hour long challenge. Ideally, the instructions and tutorials are integrated directly into the programming platform, to avoid switching tabs or windows between the tutorial and the programming platform.

	- High School: grades 9-12
	- All ages
- Please also include recommended computer science knowledge within grade level: Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced. The Hour of Code website will highlight activities for Beginners most prominently. If you’d like to prepare Intermediate and Advanced Hour of Code Activities, please include the prior knowledge needed in the description of your activity.
- Technical requirements:
	- In order to more accurately track participation we want every third party tutorial partners to include 1-pixel tracking images on the first and last page of their Hour of Code tutorials. Place a starting pixel-image on the start page and a final pixel-image on the end page. Do not place pixels on interim pages). See the Tracking Pixel section below for more details. 
	- Upon finishing your activity, users should be directed to <http://code.org/api/hour/finish>  where they will be able to:
		- Share on social media that they completed the Hour of Code
		- Receive a certificate that they completed the Hour of Code
		- See leaderboards about which countries/cities have the highest participation rates in Hour of Code activities
		- For users who spend an hour on your activity and don’t complete it, please include a button on your activity that says “I’m finished with my Hour of Code” which links back to <http://code.org/api/hour/finish> as well. 
- ***(Optional)*** We will follow-up with an online survey/form link asking for a report of the following activity metrics for the week of Dec. 8, 12:01 am through Dec. 14, 11:59 pm)
	- For online activities (especially smartphone/tablet apps):
		- Number of users

## Suggestions for designing your activity

**Include the CSEdWeek logo in your tutorial.** You can include the CSEdWeek logo ([small](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ojlltuegr7ruvx1/csedweek-logo-final-small.jpg) or [big](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yolheibpxapzpp1/csedweek-logo-final-big.png)) in your tutorial, but this is not required. You may also contact us to request specific permission to use the “In Partnership with Code.org” logo. ***This logo can only be used if specific permission is granted in writing by Code.org.*** We may end up creating an Hour of Code logo, but at this time we do not have one. Under no circumstances can the Code.org logo and name be used. Both are trademarked, and can’t be co-mingled with a 3rd party brand name.

**Make sure that the average student can finish comfortably in an hour.** Consider adding an open-ended activity at the end for students who move more quickly through the lesson.  Remember that most kids will be absolute beginners to computer science and coding.

**Include teacher notes.** Most activities should be student-directed, but if an activity is facilitated or managed by a teacher, please include clear and simple directions for the teacher in the form of teacher-notes at a separate URL submitted with your activity. Not only are the students novices, some of the teachers are as well. Include info such as:

- Our tutorial works best on the following platforms and browsers
- Does it work on smartphones? tablets?
- Do you recommend pair programming? 
- Considerations for use in a classroom? eg if there are videos, advise teachers to show the videos on a projected screen for the entire classroom to view together

**Incorporate feedback at the end of the activity.** (E.g.: “You finished 10 levels and learned about loops! Great job!”)

**Incorporate social media.** Encourage students to post to social media (where appropriate) when they’ve finished, for example “I’ve done an Hour of Code with ________ Have you? #HourOfCode”  or “I’ve done an #HourofCode as a part of #CSEdWeek. Have you? @Scratch.”  Use the hashtag **#HourOfCode** (with capital letters H, O, C)

**Create your activity in languages besides English.** We're focusing this campaign internationally this year and would like to have a number of activities to offer non-English speaking participants.  

**Explain or connect the activity to a socially significant context.**  Computer programming becomes a superpower when students see how it can change the world for the better!

**Do not require signup or payment before students can try your tutorial.** Tutorials that require signup or payment will not be listed

**Make sure your tutorial can be used in a [Pair Programming paradigm](http://www.ncwit.org/resources/pair-programming-box-power-collaborative-learning).**  

The three rules of pair programming in a school setting:

- The driver controls the mouse and keyboard.
- The Navigator makes suggestions, points out errors, and asks questions.  
- Students should switch roles at least two times a session.

Benefits of Pair Programming:

- Students can help one another instead of relying on the teacher
- Show that coding is not a solo activity, but one involving social interaction
- Not all classrooms or labs have enough computers for a 1:1 experience

## Trademark Guidelines
With ~40 million students having tried the Hour of Code, and over 97% of participating teachers asking us to repeat the event annually, we are taking steps to make sure we set up the Hour of Code as a movement that can repeat annually with greater fidelity and without confusion.

One piece of this is to protect the trademark "Hour of Code" to prevent confusion. Many of our tutorial partners have used "Hour of Code" on your web sites. We don't want to prevent this usage, but we want to make sure it fits within a few limits:

1. Any reference to "Hour of Code" should be used in a fashion that doesn't suggest that it's your own brand name, but rather referencing the Hour of Code as a grassroots movement. Good example: "Participate in the Hour of Code at ACMECorp.com". Bad example: "Try Hour of Code by ACME Corp"
2. Use a "TM" superscript in the most prominent places you mention "Hour of Code", both on your web site and in app descriptions
3. Include language on the page (or in the the footer), including links to the CSEdWeek and Code.org web sites, that says the following:

	***“The 'Hour of Code' is a nationwide initiative 	by Computer Science Education Week[csedweek.org] 	and Code.org [code.org] to introduce millions of 	students to one hour of computer science and 	computer programming.”***

4. No use of "Hour of Code" in app names

## Tracking Pixel
In order to more accurately track participation we ask every third party tutorial partners to include 1-pixel tracking images on the first and last page of their Hour of Code tutorials (A starting pixel-image on the start page and a final pixel-image on the end page. And not on interim pages). 

This will allow us to count users who you directly recruit to visit your website to do their Hour of Code, or users who visit when a teacher types your URL directly on their whiteboard. It will lead to more accurate participation counts for your tutorial, which will help you attract users. If you integrate the pixel at the end it will also allow us to measure tutorial completion rates. 

If your tutorial is approved and included on the final tutorial page, Code.org will provide you with a unique tracking pixel for you to integrate into your tutorial. See example below. 

***NOTE: this isn't important to do for installable apps (iOS/Android apps, or desktop-install apps)***

**Example tracking pixels for AppInventor:**

IMG SRC="http://code.org/api/hour/begin_appinventor.png/"

IMG SRC="http://code.org/api/hour/finish_appinventor.png/"

<a id="promote"></a>
## Promoting your tutorials, CSEdWeek, and Hour of Code
We are asking everyone to promote their own 1-hour tutorial to your users. Please direct them to your Hour of Code page. Your users are much more likely to react to a mailing from you about your tutorial. Use the international Hour of Code campaign for Computer Science Education Week as an excuse to encourage users to invite others to join in, help us reach 100 million total participants.

- Feature Hour of Code and CSEdWeek on your website.  
Ex: <http://www.tynker.com/hour-of-code>
- Promote Hour of Code using social media, traditional media, mailing lists, etc, using hashtag **#HourOfCode** (with capital letters H, O, C)
- Host a local event or ask your employees to host an event at local schools or community groups.
- See our resource kit for further information (coming soon).

## A special note for students with disabilities
If you create a tutorial that is designed for the vision-impaired, we’d love to highlight it for viewers with screen-readers.  We have not yet received such a tutorial, and would be eager to include one as an option for these students.
