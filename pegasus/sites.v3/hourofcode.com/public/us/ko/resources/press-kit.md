  * 학교 직원들이나 자원봉사자들에게 행사 사진을 찍어 온라인으로 공유하거나 언론에 보낼 수 있도록 도움을 요청하세요.
  * 여러분의 웹사이트와 홈페이지에 Hour of Code에 대한 글을 올리고, 학교 신문에도 게제하세요. 여러분이 진행한 이벤트의 상세한 내용, 학생들의 사진과 활동을 올리세요.
  * 페이스북(Facebook)과 트위터(Twitter)에 여러분의 계획들을 업데이트하고 12월8일~14일까지 이벤트와 사진들을 올리세요. **#HourOfCode** 해쉬 태그를 사용해 Code.org가 여러분의 활동을 살펴보고 지원할 수 있도록 해주세요.

### 단계적 가이드:

**1. Plan your event**

  * Hour of Code를 시작하기 위한 단계적 절차들을 계획하세요.
  * [부모님들에게 편지보내기.](<%= hoc_uri('/resources/#sample-emails') %>) 부모님들에게도 Hour of Code를 소개하세요.
  * [이 편지를](<%= hoc_uri('/resources/#sample-emails') %>) 지역 시장, 시의원, 공무원, 지역 사업가들에게 보내 행사에 참여해서 학생들에게 강연할 수 있도록 해주세요.
  * 모둠 활동(언플러그드 프로그래밍 활동과 같은...)을 조직하거나, 학생들이 만들어낸 것들을 발표하고, 여러 가지 활동들을 이끌어내세요.
  * Code.org의 [이 것들 중 하나](<%= hoc_uri('/') %>Hour of Code 동영상</a>을 보여주거나 <a href=)를 보여주어 관심을 가질 수 있게 해 주세요.

**2. Identify specific local reporters that cover education or local events.**

Think a local newspaper, TV station, radio station or blog.

Look online to find reporter contact information. If you can't find it, call the publication to ask, or email a general tips@PUBLICATIONNAME.com email address and ask for your message to be directed to the correct reporter.

**3. Contact local media**

The best way to reach out is by email. It should be short and communicate: why should other people care about this event? Include contact information (including a cellphone number) for who will be on site at the event. **See a [sample pitch to media](<%= hoc_uri('/resources#sample-emails') %>):**

**4. Prepare to field questions about your school event. Here are some examples:**

*Why is your school doing an Hour of Code?*

While all of us know that it’s important for students to learn how to navigate today’s tech-saturated world, many teachers aren’t experienced in computer science and don’t know where to start. This event is a chance for all of us to see what computer science is about.

We hope it’ll spark interest in students to keep learning. Research also shows that kids pick up programming concepts before they know how to read and write. In fact, their brains are more receptive to computer languages at a young age, just like foreign languages.

*Why is this important?*

In China, every students takes computer science to graduate high school. In the U.S., 90 percent of schools don’t even teach it. It’s time for us to catch up to the 21st century. We know that regardless of what our students do when they grow up, whether they go into medicine, business, politics, or the arts, knowing how to build technology will give them the confidence and know-how to succeed.

**More details and a quote you can use in materials**

"The Hour of Code is designed to demystify code and show that computer science is not rocket-science, anybody can learn the basics," said Hadi Partovi, founder and CEO of Code.org. "In one week last year, 15 million students tried an Hour of Code. Now we're aiming for 100 million worldwide to prove that the demand for relevant 21st century computer science education crosses all borders and knows no boundaries."

**About Code.org**

Code.org® is a 501c3 public non-profit dedicated to expanding participation in computer science and increasing participation by women and underrepresented students of color. Its vision is that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer programming. After launching in 2013, Code.org organized the Hour of Code campaign — which has introduced millions of students to computer science — partnered with more than 30 public school districts nationwide, and launched Code Studio, an open-source, online learning platform for all ages.
