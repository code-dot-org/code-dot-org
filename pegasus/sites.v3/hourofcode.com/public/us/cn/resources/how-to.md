# 如何教授编程一小时

## 试用教程

我们将通过各种合作伙伴，面向各个年龄学生举办各种有趣的，长达一小时的辅导。十二月8-14日前编程一小时全新教程即将拉开序幕。

**编程一小时全部教程：**

  * 老师只需极少的准备时间
  * 可允许学生按照他们自己的进度和能力水平自学

## 2)计划你的硬件需求- 电脑可自选

体验编程一小时最好配备可以上网的电脑，但是并不需要每个孩子都有电脑，甚至也可以不用电脑来体验编程一小时。

  * 在学生的计算机或设备测试教程，确保它们正常工作（声音和视频）。
  * 预览在学生完成之后将会看到的恭喜页面。 
  * 如果你选择的教程最好配合声音，请为你的班级配备耳机或者让学生们把自己的耳机带来。

## 3)针对现有技术做好提前规划

  * 没有足够的设备？采用配对编程。 学生之间搭档之后，他们会互相帮助并减少对老师的依赖。 他们也将明白计算机科学是一种社交和协作。
  * 宽带较低？可计划在全班面前进行视频演示，这样就不是每个学生都在各自下载视屏，或或尝试不插电/离线教程。

## 4) Inspire students - show them a video

Show students an inspirational video to kick off the Hour of Code. Examples:

  * The original Code.org launch video, featuring Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and NBA star Chris Bosh (There are [1 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYZF6oIZtfc), [5 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc), and [9 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1xS07N-FA) versions)
  * The [Hour of Code 2013 launch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC5FbmsH4fw), or the <% if @country == 'uk' %> [Hour of Code 2014 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96B5-JGA9EQ) <% else %> [Hour of Code 2014 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7AjDMz_dc&index=2&list=PLzdnOPI1iJNe1WmdkMG-Ca8cLQpdEAL7Q) <% end %>
  * [President Obama calling on all students to learn computer science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvmhE1J9PY)

**Get your students excited - give them a short intro**

Most kids don’t know what computer science is. Here are some ideas:

  * Explain it in a simple way that includes examples of applications that both boys and girls will care about (saving lives, helping people, connecting people, etc.).
  * Try: "Think about things in your everyday life that use computer science: a cell phone, a microwave, a computer, a traffic light… all of these things needed a computer scientist to help build them.”
  * Or: “Computer science is the art of blending human ideas and digital tools to increase our power. Computer scientists work in so many different areas: writing apps for phones, curing diseases, creating animated movies, working on social media, building robots that explore other planets and so much more."
  * See tips for getting girls interested in computer science [here](http://<%= codeorg_url() %>/girls). 

## 5) Start your Hour of Code

**Direct students to the activity**

  * Write the tutorial link on a whiteboard. Find the link listed on the [information for your selected tutorial](http://<%= codeorg_url() %>/learn) under the number of participants. [hourofcode.com/co](http://hourofcode.com/co)
  * Tell students to visit the URL and start the tutorial.

**When your students come across difficulties**

  * Tell students, “Ask 3 then me.” Ask 3 classmates, and if they don’t have the answer, then ask the teacher.
  * Encourage students and offer positive reinforcement: “You’re doing great, so keep trying.”
  * It’s okay to respond: “I don’t know. Let’s figure this out together.” If you can’t figure out a problem, use it as a good learning lesson for the class: “Technology doesn’t always work out the way we want. Together, we’re a community of learners.” And: “Learning to program is like learning a new language; you won’t be fluent right away.“

**What to do if a student finishes early?**

  * Students can see all tutorials and try another Hour of Code activity at [<%= codeorg_url() %>/learn](http://<%= codeorg_url() %>/learn)
  * Or, ask students who finish early to help classmates who are having trouble with the activity.

**How do I print certificates for my students?**

Each student gets a chance to get a certificate via email when they finish the [Code.org tutorials](http://studio.code.org). You can click on the certificate to print it. However, if you want to make new certificates for your students, visit our [Certificates](http://<%= codeorg_url() %>/certificates) page to print as many certificates as you like, in one fell swoop!

**What comes after the Hour of Code?**

The Hour of Code is just the first step on a journey to learn more about how technology works and how to create software applications. <% if @country == 'uk' %> The Hour of Code is just the first step on a journey to learn more about how technology works and how to create software applications.
