## Send these emails to help promote the Hour of Code

<a id="email"></a>
## Ask your school, employer or friends to sign up:

Computers are everywhere, but fewer schools teach computer science than 10 years ago. Good news is, we’re on our way to change this. If you heard about the first Hour of Code, you might know it made history. In one week alone, 15 million students tried computer science!

Computer science was on homepages of Google, MSN, Yahoo! and Disney. Bill Gates, Joanna Shields, Michael Smith. Will.I.Am, Shakira and Ashton Kutcher all kicked off the Hour of Code with videos. Over 100 partners came together to support this movement.

This year, let's make it even bigger. Please get involved with an Hour of Code event the week of December 8-14, 2014. Everyone around the world is doing it from the US to the UK, Italy and Australia. We managed to get over 3 million students to try an hour of code in the UK the first time around. Let's double that!

Get the word out. Host an event. Ask a local school to sign up. Or try the Hour of Code yourself -- everyone can benefit from learning the basics.

Help us reach 100 million students around the world total by the end of the year! Get started at http://hourofcode.com/uk

## Invite media to attend your event:
**Subject line:** Local school joins mission to introduce 100m students to computer science

Computers are everywhere, but fewer schools teach computer science than 10 years ago. Girls and minorities are severely underrepresented. Good news is, we’re on our way to change this.

In one week last year, 15 million students around the world tried computer science! Since March, over 3 million students tried an hour of code in the UK. Computer science was on homepages of Google, MSN, Yahoo! and Disney. Bill Gates, Shakira and Will.I.Am all kicked off the Hour of Code with videos. Over 100 partners came together to support this movement.

Now the Hour of Code movement is aiming for 100 million students.

That’s why every one of the [X number] students at [SCHOOL NAME] are joining in on the largest learning event in history: The Hour of Code, during Dec. 8-14.

I'm writing to invite you to attend our kickoff assembly, and to see kids start the activity on [DATE].

The Hour of Code, organized by the nonprofit Code.org and over 100 others, is a statement that today’s generation of students are ready to learn critical skills for 21st century success. Please join us.

**Contact:** [YOUR NAME], [TITLE], mobile number:

**When:** [DATE and TIME of your event]

**Where:** [ADDRESS and DIRECTIONS]

I look forward to being in touch.

## Tell parents about your school's event:

Dear Parents,

We live in a world surrounded by technology. And we know that whatever field our students choose to go into as adults, their ability to succeed will increasingly hinge on understanding how technology works. But only a tiny fraction of us are learning computer science, and less students are studying it than a decade ago.

That’s why our entire school is joining in on the largest learning event in history: The Hour of Code, the week of Dec. 8-14. Last year, 15 million students tried computer science in one week around the world. In the UK, since March 3 million students tried an hour of code. This December, we're joining students worldwide to reach 100 million students!

Our Hour of Code is a statement that [SCHOOL NAME] is ready to teach these foundational 21st century skills. To continue bringing programming activities to your students, we want to make our Hour of Code event huge. I encourage you to volunteer, reach out to local media, share the news on your social media channels and consider hosting additional Hour of Code events in the community.

This is a chance to change the future of education in [TOWN/CITY NAME].

See http://hourofcode.com/uk for details, and help spread the word.

Sincerely,

Your principal

<a id="politicians"></a>
## Invite a local politician to your school's event:

Dear [Mayor/Representative/MP LAST NAME]:

Did you know that in today’s economy, computing jobs outnumber students graduating into the field by 3-to-1? And yet computer science is foundational for **every** industry today. At [SCHOOL NAME], we are trying to bridge that gap.

That’s why our entire school is joining in on the largest learning event in history: The Hour of Code, during the week of Dec. 8-14. Last year, 15 million students tried computer science in one week around the world, and since March, over 3 million students have tried an hour of code in the UK. This December, we're joining students worldwide to reach 100 million students!

I'm writing to invite you to take part in our Hour of Code event and speak at our kickoff assembly. It’ll take place on [DATE, TIME, PLACE], and will make a strong statement that [Region or City name] is ready to teach our students critical 21st century skills. We want to ensure that our students are on the forefront of creating technology of the future--not just consuming it.

Please contact me at [PHONE NUMBER OR EMAIL ADDRESS]. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely, [NAME], [TITLE]
