The Sweepstakes is subject to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations and is void where prohibited. Participation constitutes entrant's full and unconditional agreement to these Official Rules. Sponsor's and Administrator's decisions are final and binding in all matters related to the Sweepstakes. Winning a prize is contingent upon fulfilling all requirements set forth herein.

      %p <strong>2. Sponsor:</strong> Code.org, 801 5th Avenue, Suite 2100, Seattle WA 98104. Administrator: Merkle Inc. (previously known as HelloWorld, Inc.), 3000 Town Center, Suite 2100, Southfield, MI 48075.

      %p <strong>3. Timing:</strong> The Sweepstakes begins on October 23, 2024 at 12:00 a.m. Eastern Time (ET”) and ends on December 31, 2024 at 11:59 p.m. (the "Promotion Period"). Sponsor's servers are the official time-keeping devices for the Sweepstakes.

      %p <strong>4. How to Enter:</strong> During the Promotion Period, Qualifying Teachers may visit <a href="https://hourofcode.com/us/events">https://hourofcode.com/us/events</a> (“Promotion Site”) and follow the links and instructions to accurately complete and submit the registration form, including your first and last name (initials are not sufficient), your work email address associated with your employment as a teacher, the grade that you teach, and your country. By completing this form, you will receive one (1) entry into the Sweepstakes.

      %p <u>Limit:</u> You may receive one (1) entry during the Promotion Period. Multiple entrants are not permitted to share the same email address. Any attempt by any entrant to obtain more than one (1) entry by using multiple/different email addresses, identities, registrations and logins, or any other methods will void that entrant's entry and that entrant may be disqualified. Use of any automated system to participate is prohibited and may result in disqualification. In the event of a dispute as to the identity of an entrant, Sponsor and Administrator will rely on the information submitted by the entrant to register for this Sweepstakes. If any additional information provided by entrant is inconsistent with the information provided at registration for this Sweepstakes, Sponsor and/or Administrator may disqualify such entrant and such disqualification may result in the forfeiture of any prizes won. Sponsor, in its discretion, may require additional documentation from entrant to show proof of entrant's identity.

      %p <strong>5. Prize Drawing:</strong> Administrator is an independent organization whose decisions as to the selection of the potential winners are final and binding. Administrator will randomly select the potential Sweepstakes winners from all eligible entries received during the Promotion Period, on or around January 6, 2025. The potential winners will be notified by email and be required to provide their home mailing address to confirm eligibility within three (3) days of the date notice or attempted notice is sent, in order to claim the prize. If a potential winner of any prize cannot be contacted, fails to provide any other requested information within the required time period or the notification email or the prize (if winner is confirmed) is returned as undeliverable, the potential winner forfeits the prize. Receiving a prize is contingent upon compliance with these Official Rules. In the event that a potential winner is disqualified for any reason or forfeits the prize, Sponsor will award the applicable prize to an alternate winner by random drawing from among all remaining eligible entries. Only three (3) alternate drawings will be held, after which the prize will remain un-awarded.

In such event, Sponsor, in its sole discretion, may elect to hold a random drawing from among all eligible entries received up to the date of discontinuance and may modify the prizes offered herein. Sponsor reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to disqualify any individual it finds to be tampering with the entry process or the operation of the Sweepstakes, including but, not limited to submitting fraudulent entries, or to be acting in violation of the Official Rules of this or in an unsportsmanlike or disruptive manner.

Sponsor's failure to enforce any term of these Official Rules shall not constitute a waiver of that provision. In no event will more prizes than are stated in these Official Rules be awarded. If, for any reason, more prize notifications are sent (or more claims are received) than the number of prizes offered, as set forth in these Official Rules, Sponsor reserves the right to award the intended number of prizes through a random drawing from among all eligible prize claims received. In the event there is a discrepancy or inconsistency between, any other statements contained in any Sweepstakes-related materials and the Official Rules as posted on the Promotion Site, the Official Rules as posted on the Promotion Site shall prevail, govern, and control.
