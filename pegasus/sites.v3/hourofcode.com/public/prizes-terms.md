# Prizes - terms and conditions

## Dropbox space or Skype credit:

The 10 GB of Dropbox space or $10 of Skype credit are limited to K-12 faculty, educators for afterschool clubs, and education organizations. The 10 GB of free space must be added to an existing Dropbox account, and the extra space expires 1 year after a user applies the credit to their Dropbox. Limit one redemption per organizer. Note: if you have redeemed a 10 GB Dropbox code in the past, you can only apply your new code to a *different* account or choose Skype credit as your gift.

Every organizer must register for the Hour of Code in order to receive the Dropbox space or Skype credit. If your entire school participates in the Hour of Code, each educator must individually register as an organizer to qualify. 

Code.org will contact organizers after the Hour of Code (Dec. 8-14) to provide instructions for redeeming Dropbox space or Skype credit.

## Video chat with a guest speaker:
Prize limited to K-12 classrooms in the U.S. and Canada only. To qualify, sign up your classroom by November 14, 2014. Code.org will select winning classrooms, provide a time slot for the web chat, and work with the appropriate teacher to set up the technology details. Your whole school does not need to apply to qualify for this prize. Both public and private schools are eligbile to win.

## Class-set of laptops (or $10,000 for other technology):
Prize limited to public K-12 U.S. schools only. To qualify, your entire school must register for the Hour of Code by November 14, 2014. One school in every U.S. state will receive a class-set of computers. Code.org will select and notify winners via email by December 1, 2014.

To clarify, this is not a sweepstakes or a contest involving pure chance.

1) There is no financial stake or risk involved in applying - any school or classroom may participate, without any payment to Code.org or any other organization

2) Winners will only be selected among schools where the entire classroom (or school) participates in an Hour of Code, which involves a test of the students' and teachers' collective skill.
