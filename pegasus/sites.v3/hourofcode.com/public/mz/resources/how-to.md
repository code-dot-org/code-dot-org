    How to teach one Hour of Code
  </h1>
  
  
</div>

## 1) Watch this how-to video <iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/tQeSke4hIds" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
## 2) Try the tutorials:

We’ll host a variety of fun, hour-long tutorials for students of all ages, created by a variety of partners. New tutorials are coming to kick off the Hour of Code before December 8-14.

**Todos os turoriais da Hour of Code:**

  * Requerem apenas preparação mínima por parte dos professores
  * Are self-guided - allowing students to work at their own pace and skill-level

## 3) Register your Hour on the map

[Make sure to sign up](<%= hoc_uri('/') %>). We'll send you helpful info as the Hour of Code nears, and you'll see your Hour of Code on our map of worldwide events.

## 4) Plan your hardware needs - computers are optional

The best Hour of Code experience will be with Internet-connected computers. But you don’t need a computer for every child, and can even do the Hour of Code without a computer at all.

  * **Test tutorials on student computers or devices.** Make sure they work properly (with sound and video).
  * **Preview the congrats page** to see what students will see when they finish. 
  * **Provide headphones for your class**, or ask students to bring their own, if the tutorial you choose works best with sound.

## 5) Plan ahead based on your technology available

  * **Don't have enough devices?** Use [pair programming](http://www.ncwit.org/resources/pair-programming-box-power-collaborative-learning). When students partner up, they help each other and rely less on the teacher. They’ll also see that computer science is social and collaborative.
  * **Have low bandwidth?** Plan to show videos at the front of the class, so each student isn't downloading their own videos. Or try the unplugged / offline tutorials.

## 6) Inspire students - show them a video

Show students an inspirational video to kick off the Hour of Code. Examples:

  * The original Code.org launch video, featuring Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and NBA star Chris Bosh (There are [1 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYZF6oIZtfc), [5 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc), and [9 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1xS07N-FA) versions)
  * The [Hour of Code 2013 launch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC5FbmsH4fw), or the <% if @country == 'uk' %> [Hour of Code 2014 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96B5-JGA9EQ) <% else %> [Hour of Code 2014 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7AjDMz_dc&index=2&list=PLzdnOPI1iJNe1WmdkMG-Ca8cLQpdEAL7Q) <% end %>
  * [President Obama calling on all students to learn computer science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvmhE1J9PY)

**Get your students excited - give them a short intro**

Most kids don’t know what computer science is. Here are some ideas:

  * Explain it in a simple way that includes examples of applications that both boys and girls will care about (saving lives, helping people, connecting people, etc.).
  * Try: "Think about things in your everyday life that use computer science: a cell phone, a microwave, a computer, a traffic light… all of these things needed a computer scientist to help build them.”
  * Or: “Computer science is the art of blending human ideas and digital tools to increase our power. Computer scientists work in so many different areas: writing apps for phones, curing diseases, creating animated movies, working on social media, building robots that explore other planets and so much more."
  * See tips for getting girls interested in computer science [here](http://<%= codeorg_url() %>/girls). 

## 6) Start your Hour of Code

**Direct students to the activity**

  * Write the tutorial link on a whiteboard. Find the link listed on the [information for your selected tutorial](http://<%= codeorg_url() %>/learn) under the number of participants. [hourofcode.com/co](http://hourofcode.com/co)
  * Tell students to visit the URL and start the tutorial.

**When your students come across difficulties**

  * Tell students, “Ask 3 then me.” Ask 3 classmates, and if they don’t have the answer, then ask the teacher.
  * Encourage students and offer positive reinforcement: “You’re doing great, so keep trying.”
  * It’s okay to respond: “I don’t know. Let’s figure this out together.” If you can’t figure out a problem, use it as a good learning lesson for the class: “Technology doesn’t always work out the way we want. Together, we’re a community of learners.” And: “Learning to program is like learning a new language; you won’t be fluent right away.“

**What to do if a student finishes early?**

  * Students can see all tutorials and try another Hour of Code activity at [<%= codeorg_url() %>/learn](http://<%= codeorg_url() %>/learn)
  * Or, ask students who finish early to help classmates who are having trouble with the activity.

**How do I print certificates for my students?**

Each student gets a chance to get a certificate via email when they finish the [Code.org tutorials](http://studio.code.org). You can click on the certificate to print it. However, if you want to make new certificates for your students, visit our [Certificates](http://<%= codeorg_url() %>/certificates) page to print as many certificates as you like, in one fell swoop!

**What comes after the Hour of Code?**

The Hour of Code is just the first step on a journey to learn more about how technology works and how to create software applications. <% if @country == 'uk' %> The Hour of Code is just the first step on a journey to learn more about how technology works and how to create software applications.
