# Prizes - FAQs


## Does your whole school have to enter to win the $10,000 in hardware?

Yes. Your whole school has to participate to be eligible for the prize but only one person needs to register and submit the Hardware Prize application form [here](<%= resolve_url('/prizes/hardware-signup') %>). Every teacher participating will need to [sign up](<%= resolve_url('/') %>) their classroom individually in order to receive the all organizer thank you gift.

## Why is the $10,000 hardware prize only available to public schools?

We would love to help teachers in public and private schools alike, but at this time, it comes down to logistics. We have partnered with [DonorsChoose.org](http://donorschoose.org) to administer classroom funding prizes, which only works with public, US K-12 schools. According to DonorsChoose.org, the organization is better able to access consistent and accurate data that's available for public schools.

## When is the deadline to apply for the hardware prize?

To qualify, you must complete the [Hardware Application form](<%= resolve_url('/prizes/hardware-signup') %>) by November 16, 2015. One school in every U.S. state will receive a class-set of computers. Code.org will select and notify winners via email by December 1, 2015.

## When will I be notified if my school wins a prize?

To qualify, you must complete the [Hardware Application form](<%= resolve_url('/prizes/hardware-signup') %>) by November 16, 2015. Code.org will select and notify winners via email by December 1, 2015.

## If my whole school can’t do the Hour of Code during Computer Science Education Week (Dec. 7-13), can I still qualify for prizes?
Yes, just be sure to submit the [Hardware Application form](<%= resolve_url('/prizes/hardware-signup') %>) that outlines how your whole school is participating over a reasonable length of time and register for the Hour of Code by November 16th.

## I’m outside the United States. Can I qualify for prizes?

Yes, all organizers, both US and non-US, are eligible to receive the all organizer thank you gift. The $10K hardware prize is US only.

## Is there a deadline to sign up to receive the all organizer thank you gift?
You must sign up before Dec 7th in order to be eligible to receive the all organizer thank you gift.

## When will I receive my all organizer thank you gift?
We will contact you in December after Computer Science Education Week with next steps on how to redeem your thank you gift.
