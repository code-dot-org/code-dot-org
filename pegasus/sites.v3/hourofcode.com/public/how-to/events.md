# How to organize an Hour of Code event

Computer Science Education Week is over but you can still do an Hour of Code all year round. Anyone, anywhere can organize an Hour of Code event. 

## 1) Prepare for your event
- Determine a venue, date and time
- Send [a letter](https://docs.google.com/a/code.org/document/d/1eP41sKW7y0qq_JvkRIgZK8dWYICaGRZ4CCDETXa78wY/edit) to invite your local mayor, congressman, governor, or influential business person to speak.
- Invite media/press. i.e. local news station, newspaper, education/tech bloggers. See our [press kit](<%= resolve_url('/promote/press-kit') %>) for help.

## 2) During your event

- Kick off your event with one of our [inspirational videos](<%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#videos') %>).
- Give an intro overviewing the importance of computer science, using these [stats and infographics](<%= resolve_url('/promote/stats') %>). 
	<br/>
	<br/>
- Other event ideas:
	- Invite a local industry leader to discuss his or her work involving computer science
	- Invite a local politician and have students teach him or her how to code
	- Have a group of students demonstrate an unplugged activity
	- Have a group of students teach the principal or a group of teachers how to code
	- If your school already teaches computer science, have students demo projects

## 3) Share how it went
- Share pictures of your event on Facebook and Twitter. 
- Use the hashtag **#HourofCode**

## Example Event Plan 
**Event:** School-wide Computer Science Education Week kick-off assembly

**Date:** Dec 7th (start of Computer Science Education Week)

**Time:** During the school day. Mid-morning event preferred. Approximately 1 hour.

**Location:** School assembly hall (e.g. theater, gym, cafeteria)
