<h1>How to teach one Hour of Code</h1>

Computer Science Education Week is over but you can still do an Hour of Code all year round. 

## 1) Promote your Hour of Code
Promote your [Hour of Code](<%= resolve_url('/promote') %>) and encourage others to host.

## 2) Watch this how-to video
<iframe width="500" height="255" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/SrnvvWDm73k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## 3) Choose a tutorial:
We provide a variety of [fun, hour-long tutorials](<%= resolve_url('https://code.org/learn') %>) for students of all ages, created by a variety of partners. *New tutorials are coming to kick off the Hour of Code before <%= campaign_date('full') %>.* 

**[Student-guided Hour of Code tutorials:](<%= resolve_url("https://code.org/learn") %>)**

- Require minimal prep-time for teachers
- Are self-guided - allowing students to work at their own pace and skill-level

**[Teacher-guided Hour of Code tutorials:](<%= resolve_url("https://code.org/educate/teacher-led") %>)**

- Are lesson plans that require some advance teacher preparation
- Are categorized by grade level *and* by subject area (eg Math, English, etc)

## 4) Plan your technology needs - computers are optional

The best Hour of Code experience will be with Internet-connected computers. You **don’t** need a computer for every child, and can even do the Hour of Code without a computer at all. 

- Test tutorials on student computers or devices. Make sure they work properly on browsers with sound and video.
- Provide headphones for your class, or ask students to bring their own, if the tutorial you choose works best with sound.
- **Don't have enough devices?** Use [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q). When students partner up, they help each other and rely less on the teacher. They’ll also see that computer science is social and collaborative.
- **Have low bandwidth?** Plan to show videos at the front of the class, so each student isn't downloading their own videos. Or try the unplugged / offline tutorials.

## 5) Inspire students to start your Hour of Code
**Invite a [local volunteer](https://code.org/volunteer/local) to inspire your students by talking about the breadth of possibilities with computer science.** There are thousands of volunteers around the world ready to help with your Hour of Code. [Use this map](https://code.org/volunteer/local) to find local volunteers who can visit your classroom or join a video chat with your students.

**Show an inspirational video:**

- The original Code.org launch video, featuring Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and NBA star Chris Bosh (There are [1 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYZF6oIZtfc), [5 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc), and [9 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1xS07N-FA) versions)
- The [Hour of Code 2013 launch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC5FbmsH4fw), or the <% if @country == 'uk' %> [Hour of Code 2015 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L97YMYqLHc) <% else %> [Hour of Code 2015 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L97YMYqLHc) <% end %>
- [President Obama calling on all students to learn computer science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvmhE1J9PY)
- Find more inspirational video [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNfpD8i4Sx7U0y2MccnrNZuP).

**It’s okay if both you and your students are brand new to computer science. Here are some ideas to introduce your Hour of Code activity:**

- Explain ways technology impacts our lives, with examples both boys and girls will care about (Talk about saving lives, helping people, connecting people, etc.).
- As a class, list things that use code in everyday life.
- See tips for getting girls interested in computer science [here](<%= resolve_url('https://code.org/girls') %>).

## 6) Code!

**Direct students to the activity**

- Write the tutorial link on a whiteboard. Find the link listed on the [information for your selected tutorial](<%= resolve_url('https://code.org/learn') %>) under the number of participants.

**When your students come across difficulties it's okay to respond:**

- “I don’t know. Let’s figure this out together.”
- “Technology doesn’t always work out the way we want.”
- “Learning to program is like learning a new language; you won’t be fluent right away.”

**[Check out these teaching tips](http://www.code.org/files/CSTT_IntroducingCS.PDF)**

**What to do if a student finishes early?**

- Students can see all tutorials and try another Hour of Code activity at [<%= resolve_url('code.org/learn') %>](<%= resolve_url('https://code.org/learn') %>)
- Or, ask students who finish early to help classmates who are having trouble with the activity.
