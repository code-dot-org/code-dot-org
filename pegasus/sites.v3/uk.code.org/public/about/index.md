# About Us

Code.org is a non-profit dedicated to expanding participation in computer science education by making it available in more schools, and increasing participation by women and underrepresented students of color. Our vision is that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer programming. We believe computer science should be part of the core curriculum in education, alongside other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses, such as biology, physics, chemistry and algebra.

## UK Hour of Code
With the UK Hour of Code, Code.org aims to help demystify that coding is difficult and enable parents, teachers and students across the nation get a fun introduction to coding. We hope that this will help build awareness of and confidence in the changes in the September 2014 School Curriculum in England.

The UK Hour of Code team is led by [Avid Larizadeh](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/avid-larizadeh), General Partner at Google Ventures and includes Baroness [Joanna Shields OBE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanna_Shields), Digital Advisor to the Prime Minister; [Sherry Coutu CBE](http://www.linkedin.com/in/coutu), founder of Founders4Schools;  [Karen Price OBE] (http://www.wlv.ac.uk/default.aspx?page=24805), CEO of  Teach Partnership UK; Niel McLean from The Tech Partnership, Olivia Koerfer, Maya Ross; William Longhill from the UK Department of Education; [Mark Lyons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanna_Shields) and [Rebecca Williams](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/rebecca-williams/13/a68/451), Directors at Antidote Communications.
