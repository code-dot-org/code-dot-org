      Computer science drives job growth and innovation throughout our economy and society. Computing occupations are the 
      %b
        number 1 source of all new wages in the U.S. 
      and make up two-thirds of all projected new jobs in STEM fields, making Computer Science one of the most in-demand college degrees. And computing is used all around us and in virtually every field. It’s foundational knowledge that all students need. But computer science is marginalized throughout education. 75 percent of U.S. schools don’t even offer computer science and only 8% of STEM graduates study it. We need to improve access for all students, including groups who have traditionally been underrepresented.

    Access to computer science courses is a bipartisan issue that can be addressed without adding to the Federal budget. Tell your representatives in Washington, D.C. that you support funding to expand access to this foundational 21st-century subject in your community that will America remain secure and globally competitive. Over 100,000 Americans, CEOs of the largest companies in every major industry, 29 governors, and major K-12 education leaders have all joined forces to call on Congress to support this idea.

      %h2 What can your state do to improve computer science education?
      States and local school districts need to adopt a broad policy framework to provide all students with access to computer science. The following eight recommendations are a menu of best practices that states can choose from to support and expand computer science. Not all states will be in a position to adopt all of the policies, and no state has accomplished all 8 yet. Read more about these 8 policy ideas at

            have rigorous computer science standards publicly available across K-12. Computer science has often been confused with broader technology education in schools.
