**Rory and Kieran O'Reilly** learned about technology side-by-side. They started with a simple gif messaging app, and after taking that first step, they continued to move forward, eventually creating a website for you to make your own gifs from YouTube videos! 

>>***"The hardest part is taking the first step. If you love what you're doing, you will continue to walk forward. Take the first step and see what it feels like."***

## What first interested you in technology and gif making? 
**Kieran:** I started learning about technology after my older brother showed me how to make an online blog. We wanted to make the background of our blog cool, and the animated backgrounds we found were gifs.

**Rory:** We think there were many first moments of gif making. The real first was when we started an app to message gifs to friends. Then we realized our friends wanted to make their own gifs. What we made became the easiest way to create gifs online (just put gif in front of any YouTube video!) 

We re-branded to <a href="https://gifs.com" target="_blank">gifs.com</a>, opened our platform to social media and live stream sites, and have been adding dazzling new effects that our users love. We just hit our first computer vision effectâ€”that means an effect generated pretty much entirely from a computer! There's a lot more firsts to come, but these are a few of our big moments. We think gifs.com is the best place to edit videos on the cloud. We want to continue pushing on that mission.

## Where do you draw inspiration from?
**Rory and Kieran:** Our parents have been the biggest help and inspiration in our lives. The hardships they've overcome, the entrepreneurial tasks they've undertaken, the examples they have set for us, and the support they give us is amazing.

## What advice do you have for the innovators of tomorrow? 

**Rory:** Challenges are part of life. We look at challenges as an opportunity to grow, and welcome any hurdle that is in our path.

**Kieran:** The hardest part is taking the first step. If you love what you're doing, you will continue to walk forward. Take the first step and see what it feels like.
