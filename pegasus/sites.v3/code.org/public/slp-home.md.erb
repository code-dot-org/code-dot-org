<p>School and district administrators have a critical role in ensuring all students have access to computer science. At Code.org, we’ve worked with more than 180 districts, and understand the challenges administrators face are often unique to each district or school. That’s why we’ve partnered with more than 60 universities, nonprofits, and other organizations around the US to help districts and schools implement CS courses in a way that makes sense for them.</p>
<p>Your <a href="#getstarted">local Regional Partner</a> can help guide your school or district on implementation, certification, funding, and more.</p>

<h2>What is computer science and who is it for?</h2>

<div class="col-60">
  <h3 style="margin-top: 10px">Computer science (CS) is much more than coding</h3>
  <p>The Computer Science Teachers Association defines computer science as “the study of computers and algorithmic processes, including their principles, their hardware and software designs, their implementation, and their impact on society.” Put simply, CS is about using technology to solve problems, make connections, or create art or games, often in collaborative and creative ways. Learning computer science, then, means learning skills essential to the workplace, like teamwork, problem-solving, creative and critical thinking, as well as content knowledge like programming.</p>

<h3>Computer science is for everyone</h3>
<p>Anyone can learn computer science, and because it’s so integral to our society, used in nearly every field or industry, it’s incredibly important that <strong><i>everyone</i></strong> has the opportunity to do so.</p>

<h3>Webinar: Computer Science for Every Student</h3>
<p>Hear from Code.org CEO Hadi Partovi and former U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan on why you should bring computer science to your school. Webinar recording also features an overview of the Code.org Professional Learning Program and a brief panel discussion with a few of Code.org's Regional Partners.</p>

<div style="width: 87%; float: left">
  <h3 style="margin-top:0">Computer sciences makes students better thinkers and problem solvers</h3>
  <p>Students who study computer science perform better in other subjects, excel at problem-solving, and are more likely to attend college, <a href="https://medium.com/@codeorg/cs-helps-students-outperform-in-school-college-and-workplace-66dd64a69536" target="_blank">according to recent research</a>.</p>

  <h3 style="margin-top:0">Computer science better prepares students for all careers</h3>
  <p>Studying computer science “prepares students for careers in government, law, the corporate sector, and graduate study,” <a href="https://exploredegrees.stanford.edu/schoolofengineering/computerscience/" target="_blank">according to Stanford University</a>. Computing occupations are now the <a href="http://www.rasmussen.edu/degrees/technology/blog/careers-in-computer-science-face-the-facts/" target="_blank">fastest-growing</a> segment of all professions, spanning all industries. Even in non-computing professions such as marketing or design, digital skills are in <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/certification/five-job-categories-increasingly-requiring-computer-science-skills" target="_blank">hot demand</a>, as the majority of all U.S. occupations now involve <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/digitalization-and-the-american-workforce/" target="_blank">“moderately digital” skills</a>.</p>

	<summary style="font-size: 18px">How do I or my counselors recruit students to take the class?</summary>
	<p>
	<br>
<p>We have a number of suggestions and materials for encouraging students to take computer science. Find them all at <a href="https://code.org/educate/resources/recruit" target="_blank">code.org/recruit</a>.</p>

<br>

<details>
	<summary style="font-size: 18px">Can we teach it in separate blocks or years?</summary>
	<p>
	<br>
<p>The answer depends on the course.</p>
<p><a href="https://code.org/educate/csp" target="_blank">CS Principles</a> is designed to be taught as a full year course. It is possible to teach the course on a semester block schedule, though we highly recommend this implementation only be used in the fall semester. Since the AP Performance Tasks are due in late April and require 20 dedicated hours of class time to complete, most schools find there is not enough time to complete the course on a block schedule in the spring.</p>
<p><a href="https://code.org/educate/csd" target="_blank">CS Discoveries</a> consists of two semesters that build on each other. Schools can choose to teach a single semester, two sequential semesters, or a single, year-long course. Options are even available for less than one semester. See the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mjfVL2JNFe2wkQirYvvIZiAVb0Z0gyVOND2pKjDKuL4/preview" target="_blank">CS Discoveries Guide to Implementation</a> for more details.</p>
<p><a href="https://code.org/educate/curriculum/elementary-school" target="_blank">CS Fundamentals</a> courses are flexibly designed for teachers new to CS who want to offer accessible and equitable introductory CS courses to their students. How you teach these courses is up to you - as part of your classroom schedule, weekly lab or library time, supporting lessons for math and language arts, or to make creative projects.</p>
<br>
</details>

<br>

<details>
	<summary style="font-size: 18px">Are Code.org’s courses aligned to any standards?</summary>
	<p>
	<br>
<p>Yes! Specifically, our courses were written using both the K-12 Framework for Computer Science and the 2017 CSTA standards. Additionally, CS Principles was written to AP standards. View standards alignment for each of our courses here: <a href="https://curriculum.code.org/csf-20/standards/" target="_blank">CSF</a>, <a href="https://studio.code.org/courses/csd/standards/" target="_blank">CSD</a>, <a href="https://studio.code.org/courses/csp/standards/" target="_blank">CSP</a>.</p>
