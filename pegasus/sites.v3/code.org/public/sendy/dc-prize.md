The Hour of Code just got a lot more historic. As [the Hour of Code nears](http://hourofcode.com) in the next few weeks, Code.org will select one lucky classroom to attend a very special, very exciting Hour of Code event in the nation’s capital — so special that all the details are under wraps!

Code.org will choose one classroom from participants across the United States. The winning students (and chaperones) will enjoy an all-expenses-covered trip to Washington, D.C. Students will participate in a full day of top-secret activities on Monday, December 8, to kick off Computer Science Education Week, when millions of students worldwide will try computer science for the first time. 

### How to participate
If you want your class to be the lucky one to experience this trip, make sure your classroom or school is registered for the  Hour of Code at [http://hourofcode.com](http://hourofcode.com/).
