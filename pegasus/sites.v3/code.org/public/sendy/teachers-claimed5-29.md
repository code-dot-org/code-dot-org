## Hi Educators,

Thanks so much for teaching our K-8 Intro to Computer Science course! And congratulations on receiving a DonorsChoose.org prize! I hope it was a hit in your classroom.

**Please request your materials through DonorsChoose.org as soon as possible because prize codes will expire before the end of June.** You were given the specific expiration date for your prize code when you first received it on the Code.org website. We recommend you get started on requesting materials through DonorsChoose.org by following [these instructions](http://www.donorschoose.org/docs/Teacher_gift_code_instructions.pdf) as soon as possible, and at least 3 weeks before the expiration date.

### In other Code.org news,
We’ll be debuting our [new curriculum](http://code.org/educate/curriculum) for elementary school students over the summer. We’ll have 3 different levels which are distinct courses:

- Level 1: **Kindergartners and 1st grade**
- Level 2: **2nd and 3rd grade**
- Level 3: **4th and 5th grade**

All three courses will be based off of the current K-8 course, which will still be available moving forward. (If you’re interested in attending a professional development  workshop for the new K-5 courses, request a spot [here](http://code.org/educate/k5).)

And it’s never too early to mark your calendars for this year’s **[Hour of Code](http://code.org/educate/hoc),** which will be held during Computer Science Education Week, **December 8-14, 2014.** Mark it on your district’s calendar and start spreading the news!

Have an amazing summer!

### Thanks for all you do,

Katie & the Code.org team
