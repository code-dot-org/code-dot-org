## Our commitment to free curriculum and open source technology

<img src="/images/impact-hero.png" style="max-width: 100%">

All curriculum resources and tutorials we author will forever be free to use and openly licensed under a [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license, allowing others to make derivative education resources for noncommercial purposes. We believe that every child deserves a high quality education and expensive curriculum should not prevent students from the opportunity to learn computer science.

If you are interested in licensing our materials for commercial purposes, [contact us](/contact). Our courses are translated for worldwide use or by English language learners. Our technology is developed as an [open source project](https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org).

Code.orgÂ® is a non-profit dedicated to expanding access to computer science, and increasing participation by women and underrepresented minorities. Our vision is that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science, just like biology, chemistry or algebra.

If you appreciate our policy around free and open curriculum, please thank our generous donors, especially Microsoft, Facebook, Infosys Foundation, Omidyar Network, and Google, without whose financial support this open policy would not be possible.
