I, [Superintendent’s/Principal’s Name at High School/District,] [Title], give permission to the College Board to release the following school-level data to Code.org:

2018 - 2021 AP Computer Science A and/or Computer Science Principles data (only schools with 10 or more students will be reported)

* # of students taking AP Computer Science A and/or Computer Science Principles exams
* # of students scoring 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
* # of Hispanic, African American, Native American and Pacific Islander students
* # of female students

These data points are to be released exclusively to Code.org for the purpose of providing its program with information about AP performance by school to assess effectiveness of their program, teacher professional development, and intervention. I agree that the stated College Board data will not be released to Code.org for any reason other than that stated in this letter.

The College Board will not disclose to Code.org any data that includes name, social security number, or other student identifiers in any manner. The College Board will not provide any school performance summary where the value of a cell is less than ten (10).

I understand that [School] can terminate the permission to continued access to the data by sending written notification of such termination to Code.org and the College Board at least sixty (60) days in advance of the effective date of any such termination. As of that termination date, the College Board will cease providing Code.org with any school data.

Please send the data to:

Alex Brenner<br>
Director of Accounting and Finance<br>
