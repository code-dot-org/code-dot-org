# Anonymized data for research purposes

Numerous academic organizations have asked to access anonymized course-progress data from our [Code Studio](http://studio.code.org) tutorials in order to research the student learning process and ideas for improving on it.

The link below is a dataset of anonymized, aggregated data of student progress through our original [20-hour course for grades K-8](http://studio.code.org/s/1). 

It is aggregated ASTs of student programs and aggregated trajectories. The ASTs are ordered based on occurrence (0 is the most common, then 1, etc). If you look in asts/counts.txt you will see the pattern. First column is Id, second is count. There is no relationship to actual database IDs per privacy concerns.
