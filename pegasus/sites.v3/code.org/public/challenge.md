## What are the contest rules?
When submitting your project, tag the special guest you'd like talk to on a video chat. BUT you can only tag one guest per entry. However, you can contact your favorite guest as many times as you want! 

Each entry must include the required tags and content to be considered and must be publicly visible.

Check out this sample tweet for inspiration.

## How do you get the project link to share? 
When you finish one of our Hour of Code activities, on the last level you'll receive a share link. Use that link when you're communicating with one of our special guests.
