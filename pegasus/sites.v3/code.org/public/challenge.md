# Join the Code.org #HourOfCode Challenge!

### Submit a creation made on Code.org and tag one of our special guests for a chance to win a 10-minute video chat with them!
**We'll be announcing the special guests soon...stay tuned!**

## How do I participate?
It's easy to get involved and win a classroom video chat with a special guest! 

**Step one**: do an Hour of Code with one of the Code.org activities below! 

**Step two**: snap a picture of you or your class during the Hour of Code.

**Step three**: Tweet or publicly post your picture on Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram and include:

- a link to an awesome Hour of Code creation made on Code.org;
- the hashtag #HourOfCode;
- and the @profile of the special guest you want to contact.

This challenge is open to classrooms, after-school clubs, and individual students. Check out this sample tweet for inspiration.

## How do you get the project link to share? 
When you finish one of our Hour of Code activities, on the last level you'll receive a share link. Use that link when you're communicating with one of our special guests.

## What are the contest rules?
When submitting your project, tag the special guest you'd like talk to on a video chat. BUT you can only tag one guest per entry. However, you can submit the same project multiple times tagging a different guest in each post. 

- Each entry must include the required tags and content to be considered and must be publicly visible.
- Feel free to enter as many projects and as many times as you want on Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram!
