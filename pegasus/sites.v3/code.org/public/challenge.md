## What are they looking for?
**Stephen Curry**: When the Golden State Warriors head to the NBA finals, we get there through teamwork. I want to see what you and your team can create. 

**Sheryl Sandberg**: I challenge girls to Lean In to computer science and create an app using AppLab!

**Russell Wilson**: 

**StacyPlays**: Everyone knows Minecraft is my favorite. 

**Susan Wojcicki**: At YouTube, we love good storytellers. Use App Lab to choose your own adventure, make a story in play lab, or post a video story about anything you created. Maybe your creation will go viral!

## What are the contest rules?
When submitting your project, tag the special guest you'd like talk to on a video chat. BUT you can only tag one guest per entry. However, you can contact your favorite guest as many times as you want! 

Each entry must include the required tags and content to be considered and must be publicly visible.

Check out this sample tweet for inspiration.

## How do you get the project link to share? 
When you finish one of our Hour of Code activities, on the last level you'll receive a share link. Use that link when you're communicating with one of our special guests.
