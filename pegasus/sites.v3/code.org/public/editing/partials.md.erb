# Useful Partials

We have a variety of partials (also known as "views") that can be embedded on many pages to provide advanced functionality. Some of these partials are documented below, but we have many more! You can browse the `/views` directory in the codebase to see all of them.

## Videos
***
All embedded videos should use our modal pop-up video player. In order for this to work, any page you use this player must have `video_player: true` in the page metadata (see the top of this page). This only works for YouTube videos. If you are using a video hosted on a different service like Vimeo, you'll have to use their embed code.

<br>To embed a video with our pop-up video player, you'll need the following information:

* (required) `id`: Can be any id name, just needs to be unique from all other videos on the same page. Try to name the id something related to the video content.
* (required) `video_code`: This code is from YouTube. For example, if the URL for the video is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip051U7Rvds then the video code is `ip051U7Rvds`
* (optional) `caption`: Appears below the video thumbnail
* (optional) `play_button`: Use `center` to appear in the middle of the thumbnail or `caption` to appear below the video.
* (optional) `facebook` and `twitter`:
* (optional) `letterbox`: Set to `false` if you don't want the black bars in the thumbnail

When YouTube is blocked by a school, we will use a different video player. In this event, you'll want to include both a download link and a new image thumbnail.

* (required) `download_path`: If this is a video made by Code.org, include its Amazon hosted download link. You can [ask an engineer](http://wiki.code.org/display/PROD/How+to+add+website+content+via+Dropbox+or+Gsheets#HowtoaddwebsitecontentviaDropboxorGsheets-Addingvideos) for the video link.
* (required) `image`: Use your own image since they won't be able to see YouTube's thumbnail

## Charts
***
In order for charts to work, you'll need to add `chart: true` at the top of your markdown file (see top of this page).

This is an embedded chart:

<%= view :display_chart, id: "chart1", type: "ColumnChart", query_url: "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PWmXjxuN2oC-baFAe4UjL_d0s1Fu-2Vb30k7ymCxRFM/gviz/tq?gid=0&range=A1:C4&headers=1", width: 800, height: 480 %>

Here is a second chart:

<%= view :display_chart, id: "chart2", type: "PieChart", query_url: "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PWmXjxuN2oC-baFAe4UjL_d0s1Fu-2Vb30k7ymCxRFM/gviz/tq?gid=0&range=A1:C4&headers=1", width: 800, height: 480 %>


## PDF generation
***
It's possible to generate a PDF file from a .md or .haml file on code.org.  A sample .haml file has been set up at /advocacy/sample.  Here are three relevant links:

* https://staging.code.org/advocacy/sample is the original simple page.
* https://staging.code.org/advocacy/sample?pdf_version=true is the non-styled version that we feed into the PDF generator. (Fear not: we can add more styling here.)
* https://staging.code.org/advocacy/sample.pdf is the PDF generated by staging.
* This functionality is enabled by creating an empty .makepdf file alongside the source .md or .haml file.  In this case we created a file called /code.org/public/advocacy/sample.haml.makepdf.

## Solid purple headers
***
These purple headers can be used for especially long pages when you need even more noticeable headers. See them in use on [code.org/widgets](/widgets). There are two styles available, one with a title only and one with both a title and subtitle.

<%=view :solid_block_header, :title=>"Computer Science Fundamentals" %>

<%=view :solid_block_header, :title=>"Computer Science Fundamentals", :subtitle=>"An introduction to computer science for all ages" %>

<br>
## Testimonials

## Social Media
***

### How to point to Code.org's social media sites
Do not use any social media components that are hosted on third-party sites. Third-party content can use cookies to track users, violating our privacy policy. Instead, use an image file that we host. This image may still link to the third-party site when clicked.

<%= view :social_media, facebook: "Code.org", twitter: "codeorg", instagram: "codeorg" %>

### How to share your page on social media

You can use our buttons to share your page on Facebook or Twitter. Below is an example of the buttons to share the Access Report. Simply replace the URL with your page's URL and update the placeholder text for the tweet.

<% facebook = {:u=>'https://code.org/yourschool'} %>
<% twitter = {:url=>'https://code.org/yourschool', :related=>'codeorg', :text=>'Does your school teach computer science? Expand computer science at your school or district. @codeorg'} %>
<%= view :share_buttons, facebook:facebook, twitter:twitter %>

### What your page looks like when shared on social media
You can customize how your page appears on social media channels by adding social media tags to your page metadata (at the top of the page). Use og tags for Facebook’s Open Graph protocol and twitter tags for Twitter. Include twitter and og tags with an image, url, description, etc. so that when your page is shared on social media they appear with specific text you provide instead of the social media channel scanning and selecting it's own content.

<br>

1. Choose a short and direct title and description
1. Choose an appropriate, hi-res image and upload to Dropbox at code.org/images/social-media.
  * Recommended upload size of 1,200 x 630 pixels
  * Rectangular Photo: Minimum 470 x 246 pixels in feed
  * Rectangular Photo: Minimum 484 x 252 on page
  * Keep it around a 1.91 width:height ratio
1. Add the following metadata to the top of your page updating the url, image path, title, and description.

	```
	---
	title: Code.org Professional Learning Partner Program
	social:
	 "twitter:card": photo
	 "twitter:site": "@codeorg"
	 "twitter:url": "https://code.org/educate/professional-learning-partner"
	 "twitter:image:src" : "https://code.org/images/social-media/your-image.jpg"
	 "twitter:title": "Code.org Professional Learning Partner Program"
	 "twitter:description": "Nonprofits, school districts, and universities are invited to apply to the Code.org Professional Learning Partner Program."
	 "og:title": "Code.org Professional Learning Partner Program"
	 "og:description": "Nonprofits, school districts, and universities are invited to apply to the Code.org Professional Learning Partner Program to help teach computer science in a local, sustainable fashion."
	 "og:image" : "https://code.org/images/social-media/your-image.jpg"
	 "og:image:width": "1200"
	 "og:image:height": "630"
	---
	```
1. Once your change is on staging, check how it appears on Facebook. First, [go to this tool](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug).
1. Enter in your page's staging url and click Debug. Then click "Fetch new scrape information." This will tell Facebook to check again for your update metadata.
1. Test from your own Facebook page. Draft a new post and paste in the full url of the page like `https://code.org/educate/professional-learning-partner` to see a preview of what the new share dialog looks like.
