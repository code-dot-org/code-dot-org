  of the tutorial. But, if you have poor or no internet connectivity in your classroom, you can download an offline version of the tutorial and install it on your students' computers before the Hour of Code.

  You can also try an unplugged lesson with your class. These can be done indoors or outdoors with any grade level and without any computers. Go to 
  %a{href: CDO.code_org_url("/learn")} https://code.org/learn
  and scroll down to the "unplugged" category.
