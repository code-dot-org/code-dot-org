# Professional development for elementary teachers
Sign-up for our inspiring, high quality [CS Fundamentals](https://curriculum.code.org/csf) professional development workshops with experienced facilitators. A teacher who attended an Intro workshop left saying "This will totally change my curriculum. I love how the lessons are prepared and aligned to the **Common Core and Next Generation Science Standards**." We couldn't be more proud! Through our network of Regional Partners and generous grants from our [donors](/about/donors), these workshops are offered at fully to partially discounted rates.

## Teachers love our professional learning!

Join the over 100,000 teachers who have participated in our workshops. The majority of our workshop attendees say, <b>'It's the best professional development I've ever attended.'</b> In fact, 90% of attendees would recommend our program to other teachers.

## Proven results

[Six different studies show](https://medium.com/@codeorg/cs-helps-students-outperform-in-school-college-and-workplace-66dd64a69536): children who study computer science perform better in other subjects, excel at problem-solving, and are 17% more likely to attend college.

Recent research also demonstrates positive links between learning computer science *with CS Fundamentals* and reading comprehension, problem-solving, and planning skills. Students with resourceful teachers [scored higher on standardized reading comprehension exams](https://medium.com/@codeorg/code-org-resourceful-teachers-higher-student-achievement-8be1efdec06e) when they did extra CS Fundamentals activities. CS Fundamentals students also [outperformed other STEM students at problem-solving executive function and planning skills](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360131520300099?dgcid=author).

### <span style="color:#7665a0;font-weight:bold;">Already teaching CS Fundamentals?</span>

<details>
  <summary style="color:var(--brand_primary_default)"><strong>Join us for the Deep Dive workshop!</strong></summary>
  <div>
    <br/>
    <p>The Deep Dive is designed for elementary educators who have started teaching CS Fundamentals but want to more deeply understand Code.org’s approach to teaching CS and need strategies to fully implement the curriculum. Developed with Code.org’s professional learning values in mind, the 7-hour Deep Dive workshop provides teachers with a hands-on learning experience with other like-minded teachers. Teachers are given the space to work through the individual challenges in carefully crafted sessions led by experienced facilitators,</p>
    <p>The Intro workshop is not a prerequisite for the Deep Dive, but participants should have started teaching CS Fundamentals before attending. If you’d like to take both workshops, we recommend scheduling them at least a month apart so you have time to try out a few lessons in your classroom before attending this workshop.</p>
    <div>At the end of the workshop, teachers will have:</div>
    <ul>
      <li>A plan for offering more of the  CS Fundamentals course.</li>
      <li>Strategies for addressing roadblocks to implementation, including any specific issues experienced in lessons taught thus far.</li>
      <li>Ideas for fostering and developing a strong classroom rapport that nurtures learners of all types through equitable approaches.</li>
      <li>A deepened sense of community with CS Fundamentals teachers and a plan for keeping in touch with other teachers in the future.</li>
      <li>A certificate of attendance.</li>
