# Professional development workshops for elementary teachers
Sign-up for our inspiring, high quality [CS Fundamentals](https://curriculum.code.org/csf) professional development workshops with experienced facilitators. A teacher who attended an Intro workshop left saying "This will totally change my curriculum. I love how the lessons are prepared and aligned to the **Common Core and Next Generation Science Standards**." We couldn't be more proud! Through our network of Regional Partners and generous grants from our [donors](/about/donors), these workshops are offered at fully to partially discounted rates.

<details>
  <summary style="color:#00adbc">**Join us for the Deep Dive workshop!**</summary>
  <div>
    <br/>
    <p>The Deep Dive is designed for elementary educators who have started teaching CS Fundamentals but want to more deeply understand Code.org’s approach to teaching CS and need strategies to fully implement the curriculum. Developed with Code.org’s professional learning values in mind, the 7-hour Deep Dive workshop provides teachers with a hands-on learning experience with other like-minded teachers. Teachers are given the space to work through the individual challenges in carefully crafted sessions led by experienced facilitators,</p>
    <p>The Intro workshop is not a prerequisite for the Deep Dive, but participants should have started teaching CS Fundamentals before attending. If you’d like to take both workshops, we recommend scheduling them at least a month apart so you have time to try out a few lessons in your classroom before attending this workshop.</p>
    <div>At the end of the workshop, teachers will have:</div>
    <ul>
      <li>A plan for offering more of the  CS Fundamentals course.</li>
      <li>Strategies for addressing roadblocks to implementation, including any specific issues experienced in lessons taught thus far.</li>
      <li>Ideas for fostering and developing a strong classroom rapport that nurtures learners of all types through equitable approaches.</li>
      <li>A deepened sense of community with CS Fundamentals teachers and a plan for keeping in touch with other teachers in the future.</li>
      <li>A printed curriculum guide with pedagogy, tips, and best practices.</li>
      <li>A certificate of attendance.</li>

## Looking for a different date or location?

If you can’t find a workshop at a convenient date or location, and you’re in the U.S., contact the Code.org [Regional Partner](educate/professional-learning/about-partners) in your area. They may already have a private workshop set up near your area that you can join, or can set up a workshop.

<%= view :professional_development_workshops_regional_partner_search %>

## Want to set up a private workshop?

Support all your teachers with a private group workshop on a day convenient for your staff. Our Regional Partners can come to your school to help your teachers work together to understand the implementation challenges they face in teaching CS Fundamentals.
If you’d like to set up a private workshop and you’re in the U.S., contact your Regional Partner through the button above.

## Can't attend a workshop, or outside of the United States?

Unfortunately, we do not currently offer professional development workshops outside of the U.S. If you are outside of the U.S., or you are a U.S. teacher but cannot attend a workshop, you can take a look at our [our self-paced online workshop](/educate/professional-development-online) to get started at no cost.
