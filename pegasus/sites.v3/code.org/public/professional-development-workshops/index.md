# Find a workshop (for US teachers only, grades K-5)
We welcome elementary school teachers to sign up for a free, high-quality professional development workshop from an experienced computer science facilitator. The workshop will provide an intro to computer science, pedagogy, overview of the online curriculum, teacher dashboard, and strategies for teaching “unplugged” classroom activities. Workshops last 6-7 hours and will prepare you to teach the Code Studio courses for grades K-5. For more information about our goals and approach to our courses, please see our [curriculum values](/educate/curriculum/values) and our [professional learning values](/educate/professional-learning/values). See [what else you'll get](#get) from attending a workshop.

If you are in the United States, [find a CS Fundamentals Facilitator](/educate/k5-affiliates-directory) near you and ask them to host one. Many of our facilitators are happy to work with you to organize a training at your school. 

If there is no workshop near you, teachers anywhere in the world can use [our self-paced online workshop](/educate/professional-development-online) to get started at no cost. And, the curriculum, lesson plans, tools, and support are also available at no cost worldwide.
