# Advanced markdown elements

## Tables
***
A table is created using vertical bars to separate columns. Use the vertical bar before the first column and after the last column. A simple table looks like this:

## Videos
***
All embedded videos should use our modal pop-up video player. In order for this to work, any page you use this player must have `video_player: true` in the page metadata (see the top of this page). This only works for YouTube videos. If you are using a video hosted on a different service like Vimeo, you'll have to use their embed code.

<br>To embed a video with our pop-up video player, you'll need the following information:

* (required) `id`: Can be any id name, just needs to be unique from all other videos on the same page. Try to name the id something related to the video content.
* (required) `video_code`: This code is from YouTube. For example, if the URL for the video is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip051U7Rvds then the video code is `ip051U7Rvds`
* (optional) `caption`: Appears below the video thumbnail
* (optional) `play_button`: Use `center` to appear in the middle of the thumbnail or `caption` to appear below the video.
* (optional) `facebook` and `twitter`: 
* (optional) `letterbox`: Set to `false` if you don't want the black bars in the thumbnail

When YouTube is blocked by a school, we will use a different video player. In this event, you'll want to include both a download link and a new image thumbnail.

* (required) `download_path`: If this is a video made by Code.org, include it's Amazon hosted download link. You can [ask an engineer](http://wiki.code.org/display/PROD/How+to+add+website+content+via+Dropbox+or+Gsheets#HowtoaddwebsitecontentviaDropboxorGsheets-Addingvideos) for the video link.
* (required) `image`: Use your own image since they won't be able to see YouTube's thumbnail

### Examples of embedded videos with different settings

[col-33]

<% facebook = {:u=>'https://youtu.be/mgooqyWMTxk'} %>
<% twitter = {:url=>'https://youtu.be/mgooqyWMTxk', :related=>'codeorg', :text=>'Mark Zuckerburg teaches loops @codeorg'} %>
<%= view :display_video_thumbnail, id: 'zuckerburg_loops', video_code: 'mgooqyWMTxk', caption: 'Mark Zuckerburg teaches loops', play_button: 'center', facebook: facebook, twitter: twitter %>

[/col-33]

[col-33]

<%= view :display_video_thumbnail, id: 'karlie_kloss_superpower', video_code: 'Bwiln7v0fdc', play_button: 'caption', caption: 'Karlie Kloss', letterbox: 'false' %>

[/col-33]

[col-33]

<%= view :display_video_thumbnail, id: "schools_dont_teach", video_code: "nKIu9yen5nc", image: '/images/test-video-sample.jpg', download_path: '//videos.code.org/social/what-most-schools-dont-teach.mp4' %>

[/col-33]

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

## Charts
***
In order for charts to work, you'll need to add `chart: true` at the top of your markdown file (see top of this page).

This is an embedded chart:

<%= view :display_chart, id: "chart1", type: "ColumnChart", query_url: "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PWmXjxuN2oC-baFAe4UjL_d0s1Fu-2Vb30k7ymCxRFM/gviz/tq?gid=0&range=A1:C4&headers=1", width: 800, height: 480 %>

Here is a second chart:

<%= view :display_chart, id: "chart2", type: "PieChart", query_url: "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PWmXjxuN2oC-baFAe4UjL_d0s1Fu-2Vb30k7ymCxRFM/gviz/tq?gid=0&range=A1:C4&headers=1", width: 800, height: 480 %>


## PDF generation
***
It's possible to generate a PDF file from a .md or .haml file on code.org.  A sample .haml file has been set up at /advocacy/sample.  Here are three relevant links:

* https://staging.code.org/advocacy/sample is the original simple page.
* https://staging.code.org/advocacy/sample?pdf_version=true is the non-styled version that we feed into the PDF generator. (Fear not: we can add more styling here.)
* https://staging.code.org/advocacy/sample.pdf is the PDF generated by staging.
* This functionality is enabled by creating an empty .makepdf file alongside the source .md or .haml file.  In this case we created a file called /code.org/public/advocacy/sample.haml.makepdf.
