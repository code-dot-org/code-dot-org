/*
  Allows for full-width banners and sections on Pegasus pages.

  Should be used on pages that:
  - have a full-width hero banner
  - use a background color to delineate between sections

  This differs from the .container_responsive class on brstrap.css
  by making the container the full-width of the screen at any size.

  The container_responsive class uses a defined width that forces margins
  on each side which makes a full-width design impossible.

  The "wrapper" class on a section element now acts as the container,
  allowing each section to be full-width.

/* Removes the gap between the top nav bar and page content if
  there's a hero banner; if there's no hero banner, the section
  element has top-padding that will add white space */
#pageheader-wrapper #pageheader {

.container_responsive_full_width {
