# Code.org Statistics

We're on a mission to give every student the opportunity to learn computer science. And we're off to a great start! 

***

## Code.org is reaching teachers
Over 800,000 teachers are on Code.org. And that's not all - over 70,000 teachers have enrolled in our hands-on professional learning workshops offered locally across the United States.

Code.org teachers <a href="https://medium.com/@codeorg/code-org-reaches-us-rural-students-for-the-first-time-7193905d8b2a">match the distribution of teachers across the United States</a>.
