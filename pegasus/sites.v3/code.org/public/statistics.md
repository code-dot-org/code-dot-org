<br>

And, many of these test-takers were female or minority students.

<br>

Two-thirds of computing jobs are outside the tech sector, which is why we need teachers from diverse backgrounds. Teachers at our 2018 summer workshops came with varied experience from all over the country!

<br>

Don't be intimidated; almost half the teachers in our Professional Learning program have zero prior experience teaching computer science.

<br>

Early results from teachers who shared their Professional Development experience suggest anyone can teach CS, and their students perform just as well!

<br>

Teachers from any background can teach computer science.

<br>

Over the last 5 years, Code.org use in schools has expanded across the US. Here's a look at the growth in US schools from 2013-2018.

<br>

Nearly one-third of all U.S. students are learning the curriculum of the future.

<div class="col-33" style="padding-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">

<a href="https://twitter.com/codeorg/status/1031304818630041603" target="_blank"><img src="/images/statistics/fit-250/world.png"></a>

<br>

Millions of students are learning computer science - here's a look at where Code.org is used the most (outside the US).

</div>

<div class="col-33" style="padding-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">

<br>

According to Code.org's "fun-o-meter," turns out our students get a case of the Monday's too!

<br>

When teachers from underrepresented minority groups lead AP CSP classes, <a href="https://medium.com/@codeorg/one-way-to-increase-diversity-in-your-schools-computer-science-classes-2aa36ecaa5f7" target="_blank">their classrooms become more diverse</a>.

</div>

<div class="col-33" style="padding-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">

<a href="https://twitter.com/codeorg/status/959441286397751299" target="_blank"><img src="/images/statistics/fit-250/student-proficient.png"></a>

<br>

And over 800,000 of those students are female.

</div>

<div class="col-33" style="padding-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">

<a href="https://twitter.com/codeorg/status/964571108627300352" target="_blank"><img src="/images/statistics/fit-250/double-enrollment.png"></a>

<br>

And this double enrollment means more girls and underrepresented minorities are taking AP Computer Science than ever before!

<br>

We're determined to <a href="https://medium.com/@codeorg/is-diversity-in-computing-jobs-improving-32f30068b7de" target="_blank">change this way before then</a>.

<br>

Universities aren't preparing nearly enough <a href="https://medium.com/@codeorg/universities-arent-preparing-enough-computer-science-teachers-dd5bc34a79aa" target="_blank">computer science teachers</a> to fill the growing demand.

</div>

<br>

It's never too late to start teaching CS!

<br>

Young women are 11% more likely to say the CS Principles programming units are too difficult for them, but they score just as high as male students!
