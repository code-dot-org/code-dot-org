    %h2 What is a Maker?
    %p Makers invent, explore, innovate, and create using technology like development boards, robotics, 3D printing, programming, and more. Maker education takes STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) a step further by inviting hands-on experience and collaboration into the classroom to help teach problem solving and critical thinking.
