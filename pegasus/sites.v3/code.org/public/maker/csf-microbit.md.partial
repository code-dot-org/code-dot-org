# Micro:bit resources for CS Fundamentals Classrooms

Have you completed CS Fundamentals Course C, D, E or F with your students and are looking to continue your learning? We have partnered with micro:bit to offer four extension lessons for each course. These extension lessons allow students to try their hand at being a maker and learn about physical computing.

Each course has a guide which contains everything you need to use the BBC micro:bit to add the immersive power of physical computing to your teaching of Code.org’s CS Fundamentals Course. You’ll find:
- An introductory exploration lesson to get familiar with the micro:bit’s features and start making links with prior learning.
- A guide to teaching the coding lessons
- Three coding lessons to choose from matched to relevant CS topics.
- Key vocabulary relevant to CS Fundamentals Course and physical computing with the micro:bit
