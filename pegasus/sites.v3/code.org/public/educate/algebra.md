# Computer Science in Algebra
### Powered by Bootstrap, Preferred Provider for Professional Development

Code.org has partnered with [Bootstrap](http://www.BootstrapWorld.org) to develop a curriculum which teaches algebraic and geometric concepts through computer programming. The two ten hour courses from Code.org focus on concepts like order of operations, the Cartesian plane, function composition and definition, and solving word problems. Or visit Bootstrap to explore their longer [Bootstrap:1](http://www.bootstrapworld.org/materials/spring2016/index.shtml) and [Bootstrap:2](http://www.bootstrapworld.org/materials/spring2016/index.shtml) courses which teach more mathematical and programming concepts. By shifting classwork from abstract pencil-and-paper problems to a series of relevant programming problems, Code.org's CS in Algebra demonstrates how algebra applies in the real world, using an exciting, hands-on approach to create something cool.

## The Two Courses

<img style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; width: 200px" src="algebra/img/csina.png"/>

### [CS in Algebra Course A](https://curriculum.code.org/algebra/courseA/)
The first 10 hour course provides students with the foundational skills and knowledge to begin using computer programming as a tool to learn about and develop algebraic functions. Students will be introduced to a graphical programming language designed for Algebra instruction, through which they will gain a deeper understanding of the order of operations, create images with algebraic expressions, and learn a technique for creating functions called the Design Recipe. By the end of Course A students will have the tools necessary to turn word problems from their own Algebra class into functions that can be used as mini apps.

### [CS in Algebra Course B](https://curriculum.code.org/algebra/courseB/)
For classes that wish to go further, the second 10 hour course builds on the skills students developed in Course A through the development of a simple video game. Students will delve deeper into the intersection of Math and CS by studying topics such as boolean logic, piecewise functions, and collision detection with the Pythagorean Theorem, using these concepts to build supporting functions that will eventually drive the logic in their culminating game.

## Aligned to Standards
Both CS in Algebra courses are aligned to Common Core Standards for Mathematics, making it possible to integrate our curriculum into the classroom smoothly. CS in Algebra is also a model implementation of Common Core Standards for Mathematical Practice, offering explicit pedagogical recommendation across all eight practice standards. Our curriculum also satisfies several of the CSTA (Computer Science Teacher's Association) standards across levels 1 (grades K-6) and 2 (grades 6-9). For more information, you can view our [complete standards alignment](<%= CDO.code_org_url('/curriculum/docs/algebra/standards') %>).

## What's the difference between CS in Algebra and Bootstrap?

Code.org’s CS in Algebra is an adaption of [Bootstrap’s curriculum](http://www.bootstrapworld.org). The primary goal of our modification was to merge Bootstrap’s content and pedagogy with our block-based language, online learning system, and scaffolding teaching paradigm. Additionally we have divided the original content from Bootstrap into two separate courses to simplify implementation for teachers who are concerned that they don’t have enough time for the full 20 hours. And, starting in 2016-2017, Code.org's in person professional development will focus on Course A. For schools that want to invest more in CS, Bootstrap offers a deeper curriculum that gives classrooms the flexibility of going beyond 20 hours and a longer in person professional development workshop covering 20 hours of material.  Depending on the needs of your school or classroom, each curriculum offers a different mix of pedagogy, content and curricular design:

## I taught CS in Algebra in 2015-2016, how is this different?

None of the lessons from the original version of CS in Algebra have been removed, but in response to teacher feedback we have restructued the course to make it easier to integrate just the Evaluation Blocks and Design Recipe elements into your class. Course A and Course B together make up the same original 20 lessons, but if you would like to use the original materials they are still available [here](//code.org/curriculum/algebra)

## Try Bootstrap's Hour of Code tutorial
The Computer Science in Algebra course was inspired by and developed in partnership with [Bootstrap](http://www.BootstrapWorld.org). If you enjoyed CS in Algebra and you want to go further with your students, Bootstrap uses WeScheme instead of block based programming and allows you and your students to explore more complex apps, games or algebraic concepts such as recursion. If you would like to try WeScheme, or you're looking for an Hour of Code tutorial for an algebra class, we recommend this short, 1 hour tutorial designed for beginners.
