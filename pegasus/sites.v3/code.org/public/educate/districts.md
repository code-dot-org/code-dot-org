## What does a K-12 district partnership look like?

We have two goals for a district partnership: 

- Expanding *access* to high-quality computer science education to all students;
- Establishing a computer science program that will grow and be sustained within the district beyond the term of our partnership.

Our commitment includes providing, at no cost, high-quality [computer science curriculum](/educate/curriculum) across multiple grade bands, coupled with high-quality [professional development](/educate/professional-development) (see links below), teacher supports, a learning platform, and course marketing materials among other things.

We also commit to matching the funds you put toward teacher stipends for high school or middle school professional development.

In exchange, we want your district to commit  to the partnership, to the goal of *access* to computer science education for all students, and to continuing and sustaining the the work we begin together into the future. 

Here’s [a detailed term sheet](/educate/districtterms) that describes what you need to do and what we will do as part of the partnership. 

## Can your district qualify?

You’ll need to apply *and be accepted* to our district partnership program. **(Application does not mean acceptance.) Before you do, consider these key requirements up front:**

1. Identify, or explain in detail, how you will identify at least 30 teachers who will participate in the professional development workshops we hold in your area. This can happen in one of following ways:

	1. Your district has at least 30 committed teachers for each program you want
	1. You join forces with neighboring districts either as a consortia of districts lead by one district submitting one application for the group or districts joining together to submit individual applications together

1. If you can’t identify 30 teachers, here are two other options:
	1. You’re in driving distance of our existing [partnerships regions](/educate/partner-districts) to join existing Code.org workshops
	1. You pay the cost of your teachers to travel to an existing region (See [XLS spreadsheet](/files/travelcalculator.xlsx) to calculate costs)

1. If you want to focus building a K-5 program, you can do so through a district affiliate trainer and identify or explain in detail how you will identify teachers who will participate in the training

1. Each teacher accepted into our professional development must teach the course -- this means taking steps on your side (such as securing course codes in high school) in advance of the partnership.

1. We will match up to 50% of the teacher stipends for high school and middle school professional development when scheduled. Budget your contribution in advance and identify the source of funding. Here is an [XLS calculator](/files/stipendcalculator.xlsx) to determine costs. (Note: Code.org doesn’t cover taxes and benefits on stipends and we don’t provide stipends for K-5 workshops.)

## What if you don’t qualify?

Check out our list of preferred [3rd party providers](/educate/3rdparty) who can help you bring computer science to your schools.
Consider a [K-5 only partnership](/educate/k5-district-partnership), or see if there’s a [K-5 Code.org workshop](http://code.org/professional-development-workshops) in your area that can prepare your teachers.

## Application Form
Applying for a district partnership is a relatively thorough process. You can read through the materials here, but we expect it to be a collaborative process, working with our district outreach team. If you qualify for a partnership (see above) and want to go through the process, please fill out our interest form to begin the dialogue.
