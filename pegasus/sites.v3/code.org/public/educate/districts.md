### Interested in partnering?

We are currently in our pilot year for the 2014-2015 school year and evaluating expansion for the 2015-2016 school year. By filling out this form you will be added to our list of districts to contact for ***potential*** partnerships in the 2015-2016 school year. Completion does not mean guaranteed acceptance into our program **as we have limited capacity**. Our expansion for the 2015-2016 school year is focused on districts in regions where we have [existing partnerships](http://code.org/educate/partner-districts) and new regions that can support at least 30 teachers in our high school program.

## The K-12 Computer Science Program

The Code.org Program consists of teacher professional development and three course packages that together represent a comprehensive approach to K-12 computer science education.  A district partnership **requires** adoption of the High School computer science course package, while the Elementary and Middle School programs may be added independently. [Learn more about Code.org's curriculum](/educate/curriculum/).
