title: Do You Qualify
---

## Can your district qualify?

You’ll need to apply *and be accepted* to our district partnership program. **(Application does not mean acceptance.) Before you do, consider these key requirements up front:**

1. Code.org currently only partners with public schools in the United States.

1. Identify, or explain in detail, how you will identify at least 30 teachers who will participate in the professional development workshops we hold in your area. This can happen in one of following ways:
  1. Your district has at least 30 committed teachers for each program you want
	1. You join forces with neighboring districts either as a consortia of districts lead by one district submitting one application for the group or districts joining together to submit individual applications together

1. If you can’t identify 30 teachers, here are two other options:
	1. You’re in driving distance of our existing [partnerships regions](/educate/partner-districts) to join existing Code.org workshops
	1. You pay the cost of your teachers to travel to an existing region (See [XLS spreadsheet](/files/travelcalculator.xlsx) to calculate costs)

1. If you want to focus building a K-5 program, you can do so through a district affiliate trainer and identify or explain in detail how you will identify teachers who will participate in the training

1. Each teacher accepted into our professional development must teach the course -- this means taking steps on your side (such as securing course codes in high school) in advance of the partnership.

## What if you don’t qualify?

Check out our list of preferred [3rd party providers](/educate/3rdparty) who can help you bring computer science to your schools.
Consider a [K-5 only partnership](/educate/k5-district-partnership), or see if there’s a [K-5 Code.org workshop](http://code.org/professional-development-workshops) in your area that can prepare your teachers.
