# Partner with Code.org to bring K-12 computer science to your district or school

Code.org partners with school districts across the country to suppport and expand computer science learning in schools. Partnerships include high quality [computer science curriculum](/educate/curriculum), [professional learning](/educate/professional-learning), online and in person supports, marketing materials, and more.

Code.org has begun moving from partnering directly with districts and schools and instead partners with [professional learning partners](/educate/professional-learning-partner) throughout the country to help bring high quality K-12 computer science education to their communities.  Code.org will work with each region’s professional learning partner and connect them with interested districts and schools.

Please [fill out our interest form](/educate/interesteddistrict) and share your information with the professional learning partner in your area ([please see a list of our current partners](/educate/district/partners)).  If there is no professional learning partner currently in your area, please reach out to qualified groups and encourage them to [apply here]()!

## Our Goals

- Expanding *access* to high-quality computer science education to all students
- Establishing a computer science program that will grow and be sustained within the district beyond the term of our partnership
