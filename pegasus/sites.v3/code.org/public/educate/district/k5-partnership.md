# Partner with Code.org to bring K-5 computer science to your district (at no cost)

Code.org is looking to partner with school districts to prepare a Facilitator (chosen by the district) to deliver one-day, in-person workshops to district elementary school teachers to teach computer science in a format that's fun and accessible.

Ideal partnerships are with school districts interested in bringing computer science to **all** elementary school students and have 30+ elementary school teachers to develop.  
<br />


**NOTE: Applications for the 2015-2016 school year are now closed. We will begin reviewing new applications in early 2016.**

## School Districts provide
- A member of the district staff who would be the Facilitator responsible for hosting Code Studio professional development workshops to prepare teachers to offer the Code Studio curriculum broadly within grades K-5. 
<br />
<br />
- Provisions to incorporate the workshop into the existing district professional development schedule.

## Apply to partner

If you are a district representative, complete <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/code.org/forms/d/1g8sS6VS2EcJ9I8PLw8-TSa7uaJqPhbHGUGyic_zmYDQ/viewform"target="_blank">this application</a>. We will review applications on a rolling basis until May 2016. After that we will review applications annually.

This is a significant enough commitment from Code.org that we can only support a limited number of districts, and therefore would like to understand your intentions as a school district to incorporate computer science into the district curriculum and teacher professional development.

Dear [Insert Name]

Computer science is foundational knowledge for all students in the 21st century. But a lot of schools don’t teach it, especially at the elementary level.

But now our elementary schools can, at no cost, with the help of Code.org. [Learn more](/educate/k5-district-partnership).

Code.org is looking to [partner with school districts](/educate/k5-district-partnership) to prepare a Facilitator (chosen by the district) to deliver one-day, in-person workshops to district elementary school teachers to teach computer science in a format that's fun and accessible. 

If accepted, Code.org would cover all costs of training the Facilitator, and would provide, free of charge, the Code Studio curriculum, supplies needed to host the workshops, including take home materials for attending teachers such as a printed curriculum guide, classroom supplies to teach the unplugged activities and fun Code.org swag.

In return, the district would be responsible for identifying a member of the district staff to facilitate the Code Studio professional development workshops and prepare district teachers to offer the Code Studio curriculum broadly within grades K-5.

As a member of our community I strongly urge our school district [apply to partner](/educate/k5-district-partnership) with Code.org to bring these life-changing skills to our children! [Sign up](/educate/k5-district-partnership)!

Sincerely,
