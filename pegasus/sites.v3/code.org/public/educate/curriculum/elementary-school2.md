# Computer Science Fundamentals for elementary school

[Curriculum Overview](#overview) | [How to Teach](#teach) | [Other Resources](#other)

Now even the youngest students can explore the limitless world of computing - at no cost to schools. Code.org’s K-5 courses blend online, self-guided, and self-paced tutorials with “unplugged” activities that require no computer at all! Even kindergarten-aged pre-readers can participate.

By the end of each course, students create interactive games or stories that they can share with anyone.

The courses are flexible, too, so educators can adjust them based on their students’ developmental level and prior experience. 

All lessons align to <a href="http://csta.acm.org/Curriculum/sub/K12Standards.html" target="_blank">CSTA Computer Science Standards</a> and <a href="http://www.iste.org/standards/standards-for-students" target="_blank">ISTE standards</a>. They additionally reinforce concepts and skills taught in other subject areas by integrating national <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/Math/" target="_blank">Math</a>, <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/" target="_blank">English Language Arts</a>, and <a href="http://www.nextgenscience.org/next-generation-science-standards" target="_blank">Science</a> standards.

### <strong>Teacher dashboard</strong>
The Code Studio teacher dashboard makes it easy for teachers to view lesson plans, create student accounts and monitor student progress. Students don't need an email address to have an account in Code Studio. Students can even log in with a picture instead of a text password.
