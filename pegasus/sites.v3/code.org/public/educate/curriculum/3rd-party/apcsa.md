# 3rd Party Educator Resources for Advanced Placement Computer Science A

There are two AP computer science offerings, and students can take either course in any order. The AP Computer Science
A course and exam focuses on computing skills related to programming in Java. The new AP Computer Science Principles
course complements AP Computer Science A as it aims to broaden participation in the study of computer science.

While Code.org does not have an AP Computer Science A curriculum, there already exists a number of great curricula and programs 
available to teacher and students. Especially if you are an existing AP CS Principles teacher looking
to expand your CS program, these resources should be a great place to start.
