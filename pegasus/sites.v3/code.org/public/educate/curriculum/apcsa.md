# Educator Resources for Advanced Placement Computer Science A

There are two AP computer science offerings, and students can take either course in any order. The AP Computer Science
A course and exam focuses on computing skills related to programming in Java. The new AP Computer Science Principles
course complements AP Computer Science A as it aims to broaden participation in the study of computer science.

While Code.org does not currently offer an AP Computer Science A curriculum, there are already many great curricula and programs 
available to teachers and students. Especially if you are an existing AP CS Principles teacher looking
to expand your CS program, these resources should be a great place to start.

## Advanced Placement Summer Institute (APSI)

To get an overview of the course and exam, Advanced Placement Summer Institutes are available for the AP CS A course. College Boardâ€“endorsed presenters lead participants through a review of materials including course 
outlines, content-related handouts, student samples, and scoring guidelines that focus on specific
pedagogical techniques and content-specific strategies that you can use in your classroom. [Learn more & find workshops](http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/professional_development/workshops/computer_science/232463.html)
