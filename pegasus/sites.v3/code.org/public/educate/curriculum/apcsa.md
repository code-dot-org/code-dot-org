# Educator Resources for Advanced Placement Computer Science A

There are two AP computer science offerings, and students can take either course in any order. The AP Computer Science A course and exam focuses on computing skills related to programming in Java. The AP Computer Science Principles course introduces students to the foundational concepts of computer science and challenges them to explore how computing and technology can impact the world.

While Code.org does not currently offer an AP Computer Science A curriculum, there are already many great curricula and programs available to teachers and students. Especially if you are an existing AP CS Principles teacher looking to expand your CS program, these resources should be a great place to start.

[Learn more about the AP Computer Science A course and exam at the College Board website](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a?course=ap-computer-science-a).

## Advanced Placement Summer Institute (APSI)

To get an overview of the course and exam, Advanced Placement Summer Institutes are available for the AP CS A course. College Board–endorsed presenters lead participants through a review of materials including course 
outlines, content-related handouts, student samples, and scoring guidelines that focus on specific
pedagogical techniques and content-specific strategies that you can use in your classroom. [Learn more & find workshops](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/professional-development/workshops-summer-institutes/about-workshops?course=ap-computer-science-a)

The goals of the CSAwesome curriculum are to (1) provide an interactive curriculum for students that uses frequent, small practice problems that allow students to incrementally build their Java programming skills and (2) engage all students and support teachers and students transitioning from a Computer Science Principles (CSP) course to CS A. | CSAwesome professional development is offered in two formats: Immersion PD for teachers experienced with CS A and/or Java (45 hrs) or Extended PD for teachers new to CS A and/or Java (65 hrs). Teachers work collaboratively throughout the PD and the academic year in a professional learning community (PLC) of ~10-12 teachers which is guided by a Master Teacher (an experienced CS A teacher and facilitator). During the PD, teachers complete Java programming lessons and challenges (just as their students would), participate in equity and pedagogy sessions, and review curriculum and AP exam materials in preparation for teaching the course. | Free curriculum includes lesson plans and interactive e-book. Immersion PD for teachers experienced with CS A and/or Java (45 hrs) $1750/teacher, Extended PD for teachers new to  CS A and/or Java (65 hrs) costs $2400/teacher. |
| [Edhesive](https://edhesive.com) | Year-long advanced CS course, endorsed by College Board. This blended curriculum emphasizes problem-solving, algorithm development, and provides students with ample experience to apply programming tools to solve complex problems. | A 40-hour asynchronous program that provides teachers with the information and resources needed to effectively facilitate the AP CSA course in a blended learning environment. Teachers will learn Java, and focus on topics that students typically find challenging. In-person PD also available; inquire for details. | CSA: $2500/site or $150 student; PD: $1000 for full online course; inquire about in-person options. |
