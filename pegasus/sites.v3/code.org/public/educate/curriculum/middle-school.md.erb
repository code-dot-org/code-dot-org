Computer Science Discoveries is an introductory course for 6 - 10th grade students that can be flexibly taught as a single semester, two semesters over multiple years, or as a full year course. Mapped to CSTA standards, the course takes a wide lens on computer science by covering topics such as problem solving, programming, physical computing, user-centered design, and data, while inspiring students as they build their own websites, apps, games, and physical computing devices.

For a lightweight option that can be integrated as a unit in an existing technology or programming class, or as an after-school program, Code.org offers the 30-hour Express Course. This course covers all the core concepts from the elementary school curriculum [Computer Science Fundamentals](/educate/curriculum/elementary-school), but at an accelerated pace designed for students ages 10 - 18.

Code.org has partnered with the award-winning [Project GUTS](http://www.projectguts.org/) (Growing Up Thinking Scientifically) to help science teachers introduce computer science as a tool to teach modeling and simulation. This curriculum teaches computer science practices and concepts in the context of life, physical and earth sciences. CS in Science is based on a crosswalk identifying areas of overlap between the NGSS and Computer Science Teachers Association K-12 Computer Science Standards.

# For Algebra Classrooms

Code.org has partnered with [Bootstrap](http://www.bootstrapworld.org) to adapt their algebra-aligned curriculum to a block based course that teaches algebraic and geometric concepts through computer programming. The lessons focus on concepts like order of operations, the Cartesian plane, function composition and definition, and solving word problems - all within the context of video game design.

# Computer science lessons in other subjects

Are you interested in a few lessons to demonstrate how computer science can be used in another subject area? Partners have created introductory tutorials as part of the Hour of Code. These activities are an ideal  for math, history, or other subject-area teachers interested in supplementing their curriculum and allowing students explore the cross disciplinary aspects of computer science. Activites are available for [science](https://hourofcode.com/learn?grade=6-8&subject=science), [math](https://hourofcode.com/learn?grade=6-8&subject=math), [social studies](https://hourofcode.com/learn?grade=6-8&subject=history), [language arts](https://hourofcode.com/learn?grade=6-8&subject=la), and [art/media/music](https://hourofcode.com/learn?grade=6-8&subject=art) classes.
