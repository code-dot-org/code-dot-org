## High quality workshops for teachers, at no cost (US only)

Our curriculum is completely free for anyone, anywhere to teach. To help teachers implement our courses for grades K-5, Code.org offers high-quality, 1-day workshops for educators and content-area teachers (librarians, tech-ed specialists, etc.). These workshops are led by experienced Code.org facilitators in locations across the United States. 

Attendees learn how to use Code.org's courses to introduce computer science basics in a format that's fun and accessible to the youngest learners (grades K-5). Attendees also receive all the supplies they need to teach—at no cost.

By the end of each course, students create interactive games or stories that they can share with anyone.

The courses are flexible, too, so educators can adjust them based on their students’ developmental level and prior experience. 

All lessons align to all relevant computer science standards, as well as to the <a href="http://www.iste.org/standards/standards-for-students" target="_blank">ISTE standards</a>. They additionally reinforce concepts and skills taught in other subject areas by integrating national <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/Math/" target="_blank">Math</a>, <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/" target="_blank">English Language Arts</a>, and <a href="http://www.nextgenscience.org/next-generation-science-standards" target="_blank">Science</a> standards. Read more about our [curriculum philosophy here](https://code.org/educate/curriculum-philosophy).

### <strong>Teacher dashboard</strong>
The Code Studio teacher dashboard makes it easy for teachers to view lesson plans, create student accounts and monitor student progress. Students don't need an email address to have an account in Code Studio. Students can even log in with a picture instead of a text password.
