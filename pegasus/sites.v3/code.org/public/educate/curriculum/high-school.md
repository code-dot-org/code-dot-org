# High School 
For high schools, we offer two years of Computer Science courses for beginners: Exploring Computer Science and AP Computer Science Principles. If you want to go even further with your students, the third party resources below provide additional courses in programming, AP Computer Science A,  algebra, and more.

# Exploring Computer Science

<img src="<%= CDO.shared_image_url("courses/logo_ecs.png") %>">

Leveraging years of research by the [National Science Foundation](http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503582&org=CISE), a team from UCLA has developed Exploring Computer Science, a nationally recognized introductory computer science course that includes curriculum, professional development, and [assessments built by SRI International](http://pact.sri.com/resources.html). Code.org offers a program to support version 5 of the ECS curriculum, which is composed of six instructional units with lessons that are designed to promote an inquiry-based approach to teaching and learning foundational concepts in computer science, while building students' computational practices and problem solving skills. The professional learning experience for version 5 of ECS is based on three major pillars: computer science content/concepts, inquiry, and equity.

# Computer Science Principles

<br />

The College Board has proposed a new AP® course called AP® Computer Science: Principles.*  The course is designed to be far more than a traditional introduction to programming - it is a rigorous, engaging, and approachable course that explores many of the big, foundational ideas of computing so that all students understand how these concepts are transforming the world we live in. The official AP® exam is set to go live in the 2016-17 school year with an exam and portfolio-based assessment.

Code.org's curriculum consists of daily lesson plans, videos, tutorials, tools, and assessments that cover learning objectives from the [CS Principles Curriculum Framework](http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/comp-sci-principles-draft-cf-final.pdf). Course materials teach this class in the context of learning about the the Internet and programming in the JavaScript language.

# Computer Science Discoveries
Computer Science Discoveries is a full-year introductory computer science survey course (can be implemented as two standalone semesters) targeted at upper middle school and lower high school. The course takes a wide lens on computer science by covering topics such as programming, physical computing, HTML/CSS, and data. Students are empowered to create authentic artifacts and engage with CS as a medium for creativity, communication, problem solving, and fun. This course is currently in development and will be ready for the 2017-2018 school year.
