High School 

[/solid-block-header]

For high schools, we offer two years of Computer Science courses for beginners. The first course, Computer Science Discoveries, is designed for grades 7-9, and will be rolling out Summer 2017. The second, Computer Science Principles, is broadly available and can be implemented as an AP course or an introductory course. If you want to go even further with your students, the third party resources below provide additional courses in programming, game design, and more. Read more about our [curriculum philosophy here](https://code.org/educate/curriculum-philosophy).

Computer Science Principles

<br />

The College Board has proposed a new AP速 course called AP速 Computer Science Principles.*  The course is designed to be far more than a traditional introduction to programming - it is a rigorous, engaging, and approachable course that explores many of the big, foundational ideas of computing so that all students understand how these concepts are transforming the world we live in. The official AP速 exam is set to go live in the 2016-17 school year with an exam and portfolio-based assessment.

Code.org's curriculum consists of daily lesson plans, videos, tutorials, tools, and assessments that cover learning objectives from the [CS Principles Curriculum Framework](http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/comp-sci-principles-draft-cf-final.pdf). Course materials teach this class in the context of learning about the the Internet and programming in the JavaScript language.

Computer Science Discoveries

[/solid-block-header]

<img src="/images/csdiscoveries-montage.jpg" width="500px">

Computer Science Discoveries is a full-year introductory computer science survey course (can be implemented as two standalone semesters) targeted at upper middle school and lower high school (grades 7-9). The course takes a wide lens on computer science by covering topics such as programming, physical computing, HTML/CSS, and data. Students are empowered to create authentic artifacts and engage with CS as a medium for creativity, communication, problem solving, and fun.  This course will be piloted in Spring 2017, and will be rolling out Summer 2017.

## Units of Study

* **Unit 1:** Problem Solving: Computers and Logic
* **Unit 2:** The Internet: Web Development
* **Unit 3:** Programming: Interactive Games & Animations
* **Unit 4:** Problem Solving: The Design Process
* **Unit 2:** The Internet: Data and Society
* **Unit 3:** Programming: The Internet of Things

Computer Science Fundamentals - Accelerated

[/solid-block-header]

Code.org offers a four course [Computer Science Fundamentals](https://studio.code.org) progression for elementary school students. If your students have not already taken all of these courses, the 20-hour accelerated course covers the core concepts from the first four courses at an accelerated pace designed for students ages 10-18. This can be worked into a high school school after-school program or as a unit in a technology or programming class.
