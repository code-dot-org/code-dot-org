High School

[/solid-block-header]

For high schools, we offer two years of Computer Science courses for beginners. The first course, Computer Science Discoveries, is designed for grades 7-9, and will be rolling out Summer 2017. The second, Computer Science Principles, is broadly available and can be implemented as an AP course or an introductory course. If you want to go even further with your students, the third party resources below provide additional courses in programming, game design, and more. Our curriculum is available at [no cost](/commitment) for anyone, anywhere to teach. You can read more about our [curriculum values here](/educate/curriculum/values).

Computer Science Discoveries is a full-year introductory computer science survey course (can be implemented as two standalone semesters) targeted at upper middle school and lower high school (grades 7-9). The course takes a wide lens on computer science by covering topics such as programming, physical computing, HTML/CSS, and data. Students are empowered to create authentic artifacts and engage with CS as a medium for creativity, communication, problem solving, and fun.  This course will be piloted in Spring 2017, and will be rolling out Summer 2017.

The College Board has proposed a new AP® course called AP® Computer Science Principles.*  The course is designed to be far more than a traditional introduction to programming - it is a rigorous, engaging, and approachable course that explores many of the big, foundational ideas of computing so that all students understand how these concepts are transforming the world we live in. The official AP® exam is set to go live in the 2016-17 school year with an exam and portfolio-based assessment.

Code.org's curriculum consists of daily lesson plans, videos, tutorials, tools, and assessments that cover learning objectives from the [CS Principles Curriculum Framework](https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf). Course materials teach this class in the context of learning about the the Internet and programming in the JavaScript language.

For a lighterweight option that can be integrated as a unit in an existing technology or programming class, or as a high school after-school program,
Code.org offers the the 20-hour Accelerated course. The 20-hour Accelerated course covers the core concepts from the first four courses of the
[Computer Science Fundamentals](https://studio.code.org) progression for elementary school students, but at an accelerated pace designed for students ages 10-18.

AP Computer Science A in Java

[/solid-block-header]

There are two AP computer science offerings, and students can take either course in any order. The AP Computer Science A course and exam focuses on computing skills related to programming in Java. The new AP Computer Science Principles course complements AP Computer Science A as it aims to broaden participation in the study of computer science.

While Code.org does not have an AP Computer Science A curriculum, there already exists a number of great curricula and programs available to teacher and students.
