Our six Computer Science Fundamentals courses are designed to be flexible for your classroom. How you implement is up to you - teach CS Fundamentals for your next science unit, use it to support math concepts, add technology time to your schedule once a week, or go deeper with extension activities and projects!

New to teaching computer science? No worries! Most of our teachers have never taught computer science before. Try one of our CS Fundamentals courses yourself to learn ahead of your students, or sign up for a [professional development workshop](/professional-development-workshops) near you!

## It's relevant.

Our curriculum was created with the 2017 Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) standards</a> in mind, but also includes opportunities to support national Math, English Language Arts, and Science standards. In fact, <a href="https://medium.com/@codeorg/code-org-resourceful-teachers-higher-student-achievement-8be1efdec06e", target=_"blank">a recent research study</a> found that classrooms with resourceful teachers see higher scores on English, math, and science standardized tests after teaching these lessons. Click <a href="https://curriculum.code.org/csf-18/standards/", target=_"blank">here</a> to see how CS Fundamentals lessons support standards.

### Supported Standards

* <a href="https://www.csteachers.org/page/standards", target=_"blank">Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA)</a>
* <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/" target=_"blank">Common Core English Language Arts</a>
* <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/Math/",  target=_"blank">Common Core Math</a>
* <a href="http://www.nextgenscience.org/next-generation-science-standards" target=_"blank">Next Generation Science</a>

## It's easy to get started.

The courses include daily lesson plans, student activities, and answer keys for teachers. You don't even need a user account to try it out. Once you get a feel for the courses, <a href="https://studio.code.org/users/sign_up", target=_"blank">sign up as a teacher</a> to see the lesson plans, join the teacher forums, and get access to all the resources you need. Next, quickly set up a classroom section from your roster or sync with tools like Clever or Google Classroom to view your students' progress and manage their accounts. Then celebrate your students' learning by printing certificates they can bring home when they finish the course.


## And, did we mention that it's fun!?

Your students will create their own games, art, and digital stories that they can share - all while developing problem-solving, collaboration, persistence, and computational thinking skills. Do your students love to get up and move around? Half of the lessons are "unplugged" activities that teach computational thinking and digital citizenship skills without computers. See some awesome student creations below!

# Selecting the right course for your class

<img src="/images/fit-970/CSFimages/Course_Map.png" style="max-width: 100%"/>

For students new to computer science, each course begins with a grade-appropriate entry point and structured ramp-up of concepts. The progression of Courses A-F builds upon each other to ensure continuing students stay interested and learn new things. This allows you to use the same course at any grade level for all students, regardless of their experience. If youâ€™re looking for a more comprehensive course, the Express Course combines the best of Courses A-F into a single condensed course (with a simpler option for pre-readers). Explore the lesson plans and download the 2018 version of the <a href="https://curriculum.code.org/csf/", target=_"blank">curriculum guide for Courses A-F here</a>.

If you've been teaching Courses 1-4 and want to know how to transition to teaching Courses A-F, check out our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dFgrHiW-ERpNGey7yrNcoxU0LEfH9kFbdeLJn2QyJTA/edit?usp=sharing", target=_"blank">Transition Guide</a>.

CS Fundamentals Express combines the best of Courses A-F into a single condensed course (with a simpler option for pre-readers). We recommend Courses A-F for most classrooms, but if your school only offers one computer science course or you want to have your students work through multiple courses in a single year, the Express course is a better choice. By removing the ramp up between years, the express course provides a smoother path and doesnâ€™t repeat concepts for students unnecessarily. This is also our recommended option for students studying computer science on their own, outside of a classroom.

# International CS Fundamentals: Courses 1-4 and Accelerated

We are working on translating Courses A-F and the Express Course to languages beyond English. In the meantime, we recommend using Courses 1-4 and the Accelerated Course. These courses cover the same basic concepts and have already been translated into 25+ languages.

# Looking for unplugged activities?

If you don't have computers in your classroom, these unplugged lessons can either be used alone or with other computer science lessons on related concepts.
