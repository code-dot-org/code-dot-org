Computer Science Fundamentals

[/solid-block-header]

### [No-Cost Teacher Workshops](#teach) | [Curriculum Overview](#overview) | [Other Resources](#other)

Now even the youngest students can explore the limitless world of computing. Code.org’s K-5 courses blend online, self-guided, and self-paced tutorials with “unplugged” activities that require no computer at all! Even kindergarten-aged pre-readers can participate. Our curriculum is available at [no cost](/commitment) for anyone, anywhere in the world to teach.

## High quality workshops for teachers, at no cost (US only)

To help teachers implement our courses for grades K-5, Code.org offers high-quality, 1-day workshops for educators and content-area teachers (librarians, tech-ed specialists, etc.). These workshops are led by experienced Code.org facilitators in locations across the United States.

Attendees learn how to use Code.org's courses to introduce computer science basics in a format that's fun and accessible to the youngest learners (grades K-5). Attendees also receive all the supplies they need to teach—at no cost.

[/solid-block-header]

Our Computer Science (CS) Fundamentals curriculum is implemented within [Code Studio](http://studio.code.org), our online education platform. This curriculum consists of multiple courses, each of which has about 20 lessons that may be implemented as one unit or over the course of a semester. Explore our courses below!

By the end of each course, students create interactive games or stories that they can share with anyone.

The courses are flexible, too, so educators can adjust them based on their students’ developmental level and prior experience.

All lessons align to all relevant computer science standards, as well as to the <a href="http://www.iste.org/standards/standards-for-students" target="_blank">ISTE standards</a>. They additionally reinforce concepts and skills taught in other subject areas by integrating national <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/Math/" target="_blank">Math</a>, <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/" target="_blank">English Language Arts</a>, and <a href="http://www.nextgenscience.org/next-generation-science-standards" target="_blank">Science</a> standards.

### <strong>Teacher Home Page</strong>
The Code Studio teacher home page makes it easy for teachers to view lesson plans, create student accounts and monitor student progress. Students don't need an email address to have an account in Code Studio. Students can even log in with a picture instead of a text password.

### <strong>Tech support & teacher forums</strong>
Get online assistance while using our curriculum through product FAQs, technical support, and forums where you can communicate with other Code.org teachers! [Learn more here](/educate/support).

### <strong>Pilot the '17-'18 version of the curriculum!</strong>
We are revising Courses 1 - 4 based on the great feedback we've gotten in the last couple of years. In particular, the biggest change we are making
is to break the content up into 6 courses aligned to each K-5 grade level. We're collecting feedback in Spring 2017 in preparation for making these courses broadly
available for the '17 - '18 school year. [Learn more and sign up for the pilot](/educate/curriculum/cs-fundamentals-pilot).

If you are preparing for the transition from Courses 1 - 4 to Courses A - F, check out our short [transition guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2rFfrktasxBNUZDc2l5N01HYms/view) and [webinar](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2rFfrktasxBYVFCMDhfNVRFTjg) so that you have all the information you need to get started!
