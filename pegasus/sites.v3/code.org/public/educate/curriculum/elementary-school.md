By the end of each course, students create interactive games or stories that they can share with anyone.

The courses are flexible, too, so educators can adjust them based on their students’ developmental level and prior experience. 

All lessons align to <a href="http://csta.acm.org/Curriculum/sub/K12Standards.html" target="_blank">CSTA Computer Science Standards</a> and <a href="http://www.iste.org/standards/standards-for-students" target="_blank">ISTE standards</a>. They additionally reinforce concepts and skills taught in other subject areas by integrating national <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/Math/" target="_blank">Math</a>, <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/" target="_blank">English Language Arts</a>, and <a href="http://www.nextgenscience.org/next-generation-science-standards" target="_blank">Science</a> standards.

### <strong>Teacher dashboard</strong>
The Code Studio teacher dashboard makes it easy for teachers to view lesson plans, create student accounts and monitor student progress. Students don't need an email address to have an account in Code Studio. Students can even log in with a picture instead of a text password.
