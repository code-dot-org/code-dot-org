Course A offers a computer science curriculum for beginning readers, including Kindergarten students. Students will learn to program using commands like loops and events. The lessons featured in this course also teach students to meaningfully collaborate with others, investigate different problem-solving techniques, persist in the face of challenging tasks, and learn about internet safety.'%>

We developed Course B with first graders in mind. While the concepts in Course B parallel those in Course A, students learn more sophisticated unplugged activities and work through a greater variety of puzzles. Students will learn the basics of programming, collaboration techniques, investigation and critical thinking skills, persistence in the face of difficulty, and internet safety. At the end of this course, students create games in the Play Lab programming environment.'%>

We created Course E for students in fourth grade. The course begins with an introduction to the Sprite Lab programming tool. Students will learn to make fun, interactive projects that reinforce what they’ll learn about online safety. Following these lessons, students will engage in more complex coding. Students will learn about nested loops, functions, and conditionals. By the end of the course, students will combine these concepts to solve challenging puzzles. The course ends with an open-ended project where students create a game or drawing.' %>

We created Course F for students in the fifth grade. The course begins by looking at how users make choices in the apps they use. Students then learn to make a variety of Sprite Lab apps that also offer choices for the user. In the later lessons in the course, students will learn more advanced concepts, including variables and “for” loops. Students are given greater autonomy and more choices throughout this course. By the end of the course, students will have created interactive projects and artwork to share with their friends and family.' %>

## Selecting the right course

<br>
<br>
The progression of Courses A-F build upon each other to ensure continuing students stay interested and learn new things. This allows you to use the same course at any grade level for all students, regardless of their experience. All courses make suitable entry points for students.

Express courses are designed for situations where the teacher is not able to play an active role in engaging students. Express courses do not have unplugged lessons and instead focus on covering content from A-F counterparts in a way that can be delivered without a teacher.
