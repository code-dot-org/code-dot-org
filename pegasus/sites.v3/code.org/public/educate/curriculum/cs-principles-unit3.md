# Important Note: Designed primarily for use in CS Principles classrooms 
The programming challenges you're about to try are designed to be supported by an in-classroom teacher, as the third unit in a year-long high school course.

There will be rough edges if you try this course without a teacher leading the classroom with the [associated lesson plans](/educate/csp/unit3).

In particular, because of the open-ended nature of many of the challenges, there is _**no automatic code checking**_ done by Code Studio. (In a classroom setting, teachers can check students' programs, and students are encouraged to peer review each other's work.)
