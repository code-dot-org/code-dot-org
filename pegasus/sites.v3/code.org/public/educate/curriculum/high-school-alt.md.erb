High School

[/solid-block-header]

[Six different studies show](https://medium.com/@codeorg/cs-helps-students-outperform-in-school-college-and-workplace-66dd64a69536): students who study computer science perform better in other subjects, excel at problem-solving, and are more likely to attend college!

For high schools, we offer two years computer science courses for beginners: Computer Science Discoveries, and Computer Science Principles. Our curriculum is available at no cost for anyone, anywhere to teach. You can read more about our [curriculum values here](https://code.org/educate/curriculum/values).

# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are shaping the world around us. As these technologies touch more and more of our daily lives, they have become an essential part of foundational computer science education. In this <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/aiml">standalone module</a>, which spans roughly 5 weeks, students can learn the fundamentals of these technologies and discuss their ethical implications.

For a lightweight option that can be integrated as a unit in an existing technology or programming class, or as an after-school program, Code.org offers the 30-hour Express Course. This course covers all the core concepts from the elementary school curriculum [Computer Science Fundamentals](/educate/curriculum/elementary-school), but at an accelerated pace designed for students ages 10 - 18.

# Computer science in other subjects

Are you interested in a few lessons to demonstrate how computer science can be used in another subject area? Partners have created introductory tutorials as part of the Hour of Code. These activites are ideal for math, history, or other subject-area teachers interested in supplementing their curriculum and letting students explore the cross disciplinary aspects of computer science. Activities are available for [science](https://hourofcode.com/learn?grade=9%2B&subject=science), [math](https://hourofcode.com/learn?grade=9%2B&subject=math), [social studies](https://hourofcode.com/learn?grade=9%2B&subject=history), [language arts](https://hourofcode.com/learn?grade=9%2B&subject=la), and [art/media/music](https://hourofcode.com/learn?grade=9%2B&subject=art) classes.

# App Lab and other resources

In addition to our courses, we have tools and resources that you can blend into your own curriculum. Teachers can use [App Lab](/applab) in any course to teach students how to create apps and games in JavaScript. If you're ready to go further, [Game Lab](/gamelab) lets students make more complex animations and games including objects and characters that interact with each other. Our [widget library](/widgets) provides lessons and tools to teach text compression, encryption, pixels/RGB, and how the internet works. And, our [video library](/educate/resources/videos) helps illustrate computer science concepts for your class.
