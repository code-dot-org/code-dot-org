Did you know that computer science fosters creativity and <a href="https://code.org/educate/curriculum/elementary-school#research">teaches students critical thinking skills</a> to become proactive learners? That’s why elementary school is the ideal time for students to be introduced to CS! <a href="https://medium.com/@codeorg/cs-helps-students-outperform-in-school-college-and-workplace-66dd64a69536">Six different studies show:</a> children who study computer science perform better in other subjects, excel at problem-solving, and are 17% more likely to attend college.

Designed to be fun and engaging, <a href="https://code.org/educate/csf">Computer Science Fundamentals</a> courses blend online and "unplugged" non-computer activities to teach students computational thinking, problem solving, programming concepts and digital citizenship. The six courses are optimized for grades K-5 and each include 10-25 hours of instructed learning over several lessons. Students will create their own games, art, and digital stories that they can share.<br>
<br>
Our six Computer Science Fundamentals courses are flexibly designed for teachers new to CS who want to offer accessible and equitable introductory CS courses to their students.
<br>
<br>
How you teach these courses is up to you - as part of your classroom schedule, weekly lab or library time, supporting lessons for math and language arts, or to make creative projects.
