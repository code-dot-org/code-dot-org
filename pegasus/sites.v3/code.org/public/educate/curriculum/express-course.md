Computer Science Fundamentals Express is a 30 hour course designed for 10-18 year old students. It can be taught once a week in an after school club, integrated as a unit in a longer technology class, or used as an intro unit in a computer science class. Students learn to create computer programs that will help them learn to collaborate with others, develop problem-solving skills, and persist through difficult tasks. They will study programming concepts, computational thinking, digital citizenship, and develop interactive games or stories they can share. 

The course teaches the foundational concepts of programming using drag and drop blocks rather than a programming language such as JavaScript or Python. Blocks are an easier way to get started and many top Universities today begin their classes with block based programming.

The Accelerated Course combines the concepts taught in our [elementary school courses](/educate/elementary) in an accelerated fashion designed for older students.

All lessons align to all relevant computer science standards, as well as to the <a href="http://www.iste.org/standards/standards-for-students" target="_blank">ISTE standards</a>. They additionally reinforce concepts and skills taught in other subject areas by integrating national <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/Math/" target="_blank">Math</a>, <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/" target="_blank">English Language Arts</a>, and <a href="http://www.nextgenscience.org/next-generation-science-standards" target="_blank">Science</a> standards.

## New to Teaching Computer Science?

No worries! Most of our teachers have never taught computer science before. 

Try one of our courses yourself to learn ahead of your students. Sign up as a teacher to see the lesson plans, join the teacher forums, and get access to all the resources you need.

We also offer [free, online, self-paced professional development for teachers.](/educate/professional-development-online)


## Looking for a Translated Option for ELL Students?

We are working on translating the Computer Science Fundamentals Express courses to languages beyond English. In the meantime, we recommend using [Computer Science Fundamentals Accelerated](https://studio.code.org/s/20-hour). This shorter version of the Express course has already been translated into 25+ languages.
