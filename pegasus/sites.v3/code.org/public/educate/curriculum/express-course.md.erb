# Computer Science Fundamentals - Express
<p>If you are a teacher or parent who wants to support students in learning computer science concepts at home, we offer two self-paced express courses for beginning students of all ages, even pre-readers! These courses provide a fun, engaging way for students to learn basic computer science concepts.</p>
<p>Express courses are completed entirely on the computer and can be delivered with or without a teacher or parent (though all students can use encouragement and support--and you don’t need to be a computer science expert to provide it!) Students learn programming concepts, computational thinking, and develop problem-solving skills and persistence. Along the way, they create computer programs including interactive games and creative projects they can share.</p>

<p>These courses teach the foundational concepts of programming using drag and drop blocks rather than a text language such as JavaScript or Python. Blocks are an easier way to get started and even top universities today begin their classes with block-based programming.</p>

# <strong>New to teaching computer science?</strong>
<p>No worries! Most of our teachers have never taught computer science before. Try one of our courses yourself and you’ll see that anyone can learn!</p>
<p>We also offer <a href="/educate/professional-development-online">free, online, self-paced professional development for teachers</a>. There, you'll learn the basics of computer science concepts, review the curriculum and resources, as well as plan to implement the course in your class. If you are interested in in-person workshops for teachers, learn more about our workshops <a href="/professional-development-workshops">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you are a parent, see our suggestions for being a “lead learner” in <a href="https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/360041788871-How-can-I-help-my-child-learn-computer-science-when-I-don-t-know-how-to-code-">this support article</a>.</p>
<p>Anyone with a free teacher account can also view lesson plans, join our teacher forums, and get access to even more resources.</p>
