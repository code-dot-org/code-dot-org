High School

[/solid-block-header]

For high schools, we offer two years of Computer Science courses for beginners. The first course, Computer Science Discoveries, is appropriate for grades 6-10 and the second, Computer Science Principles, can be implemented as an AP course or an introductory course. If you want to go even further with your students, the third party resources below provide suggestions for teaching AP Computer Science A and additional courses in programming, game design, and more. Our curriculum is available at [no cost](/commitment) for anyone, anywhere to teach. You can read more about our [curriculum values here](/educate/curriculum/values).

Computer Science Discoveries is appropriate for 6-10th grade students and can be taught as a semester or year long introductory course. The course takes a wide lens on computer science by covering topics such as programming, physical computing, HTML/CSS, and data. Students engage with computer science as a medium for creativity, communication, problem solving, and fun. The course inspires students as they build their own websites, apps, games, and physical computing devices.

Designed for 9-12 grade students, Computer Science Principles introduces students to the foundational concepts of computer science and challenges them to explore how computing and technology can impact the world. The curriculum is flexible to be taught as a normal course or as an AP course. CS Principles complements CS Discoveries with a deeper focus on concepts such as how the internet works and the societal impacts of computer science. The course works for beginners and students with experience in our other courses.

For a lightweight option that can be integrated as a unit in an existing technology or programming class, or as a high school after-school program, Code.org offers the the 30-hour Express Course. This course covers all the core concepts from the elementary school curriculum [Computer Science Fundamentals](/educate/curriculum/elementary-school), but at an accelerated pace designed for students ages 10-18.

# AP Computer Science A in Java

There are two AP computer science offerings, and students can take either course in any order. The AP Computer Science A course and exam focuses on computing skills related to programming in Java. The new AP Computer Science Principles course complements AP Computer Science A as it aims to broaden participation in the study of computer science.

While Code.org does not have an AP Computer Science A curriculum, we have recommendations for a number of great curricula and programs available to teacher and students.

# Computer science in other subjects

Are you interested in a few lessons to demonstrate how computer science can be used in another subject area? Partners have created introductory tutorials as part of the Hour of Code. These provide an ideal way for a math, history, or other teacher to supplement their curriculum and let students explore the cross disciplinary aspects of computer science. Available for [science](https://hourofcode.com/learn?grade=9%2B&subject=science), [math](https://hourofcode.com/learn?grade=9%2B&subject=math), [social studies](https://hourofcode.com/learn?grade=9%2B&subject=history), [language arts](https://hourofcode.com/learn?grade=9%2B&subject=la), and [art/media/music](https://hourofcode.com/learn?grade=9%2B&subject=art) classes.

# App Lab and other resources

In addition to our courses, we have tools and resources that you can blend into your own curriculum. Teachers can use [App Lab](/applab) in any course to teach students how to create apps and games in JavaScript. If you're ready to go further, [Game Lab](/gamelab) lets students make more complex animations and games including objects and characters that interact with each other. Our [widget library](/widgets) provides lessons and tools to teach text compression, encryption, pixles/RGB, and how the internet works. And, our [video library](/educate/resources/videos) helps illustrate computer science concepts for your class.
