### We’re looking for teachers to pilot an updated CS Fundamentals curriculum during the winter and spring of 2017.

<br />
[<button>Sign up for the pilot</button>](http://go.pardot.com/l/153401/2017-01-31/djn4q4)<br />

Teachers like you play a critical role in building our computer science curriculum for all students. We're getting ready to release exciting new updates to Computer Science Fundamentals Courses 1-4 and we are eager to hear your feedback before these updates fully go live in August 2017 for the ‘17 - ‘18 school year. Help us by piloting the updated CS Fundamentals in your class now!

Learn more about the big updates below, and if you’d like to pilot this curriculum in your classroom, <a href="http://go.pardot.com/l/153401/2017-01-31/djn4q4" target="_blank">sign up to receive the development plans, latest updates, and new resources</a>.

### Why the Pilot?

CS Fundamentals has been used by millions of students, thanks to the passion and dedication of tens of thousands of teachers. And our teachers have given us fantastic feedback on how to improve. Some feedback we’ve been able to add to the current courses, like <a href="http://teacherblog.code.org/post/153273698774/course-1-now-has-an-audio-option-for" target="_blank">text-to-speech</a> for early readers, and the <a href="http://teacherblog.code.org/post/152126473234/cut-back-on-wrong-turns-with-the-new-protractor" target="_blank">protractor tool</a> for angle help. 

Some changes, however, are bigger, and would significantly disrupt classrooms if released mid-year as part of the existing courses. We have been working on these updates separately. 

And now we’re ready to share them with teachers willing to give feedback! **The biggest update to CS Fundamentals is that content will move from four courses (Courses 1-4) to six courses aligned to each K-5 grade level (Courses A-F).** 

### What stays the same? 

*Before we get into the big changes, we wanted to assure all teachers using CS Fundamentals Courses 1-4 that, if they wish, they can continue with exactly what they’re doing.* 

- **CS Fundamentals Courses 1 - 4 and the 20-hour accelerated course will *not be going away*, even for the ‘17-’18 school year.** These courses are widely used and localized in dozens of languages, so we are committed to keeping them available. Although these courses will benefit from generic improvements to the overall Code Studio interface, the actual course content will not be significantly updated or improved going forward.<br><br>
- **There is no special training or additional experience necessary to use the updated Courses A-F!** If you are interested in piloting the updates and are comfortable with teaching the current version of CS Fundamentals, the updates will feel familiar. The courses still incorporate a blend of plugged and unplugged activities, and encourage persistence, pair programming, and computational thinking in students. There will, however, likely be more bugs and issues with the updates as there are many new puzzles. So please consider your comfort level with that as you decide whether or not you’d like to join the pilot!

### Introducing Courses A - F

<img src="/images/csfundamentalspilot/introducingcoursesa-f.png" width="100%"/>

The biggest update to CS Fundamentals is that content will move from four courses (Courses 1-4) to six courses aligned to each K-5 grade level (Courses A-F). This will address a number of pain points with our existing offering:

- **Implementation in elementary school**: Many districts we partner with are interested in building a computer science pathway throughout elementary school. With Courses A - F, there is a clear entry point for every grade that builds on concepts learned in prior years.<br><br>
- **Where to start?** There is confusion today that Course 1 is an entry-point only for pre-readers, and Course 2 is the entry-point for readers no matter what age. With Courses A - F, teachers should start with the course that aligns to the grade they are teaching. (But what if students haven’t completed all prior courses? [More on that below!](#whatsthere))<br><br>
- **Grade-appropriate content**: With 6 separate courses aligned to each K-5 grade level, we can better tailor instructions to reading level, reserve complex angles for later grades, and create storybooks about persistence for circle time with little ones. 

*Also: Why the name Courses A - F if they’re aligned to the grades? We received feedback early on from our facilitators that while the courses might be aligned to specific grades, many classrooms might not be ready for their grade’s content yet. To stay neutral and avoid anyone feeling behind, we decided on Courses A - F.*

### End-of-Course Projects for 4th & 5th Graders

[col-66]

While the familiar puzzle-style levels will continue to feature prominently in our online stages, we have received feedback around incorporating open-ended opportunities for students to showcase what they’ve learned and take a project in a direction of their choosing. At the end of Courses E and F we created a series of stages that teachers will support students through to create an Artist or Play Lab project. These stages include exploring existing project ideas, planning the drawing or story/game, building the project, incorporating feedback, and presenting the project to their peers.

### Puzzle Scaffolding Updates

We've created several tools that improve the way that concepts within a stage are taught and supported throughout the new Courses A - F. 

- <img src="/images/csfundamentalspilot/moveforward.png" align="right" width="100px"/>**Limited number of blocks**: Many puzzles in Courses A - F now use “limited blocks” to only give students a certain number of times they can pull a block from the toolbox to use in their solution.<br><br>
- <img src="/images/csfundamentalspilot/morehints.png" align="right" width="15%"/>**More hints**: We now have the ability for students to receive hints on-demand rather than the system automatically giving them. With this, we can ramp up to more challenging puzzles in a stage but support students   who need it with lots of hints that they can request.<br><br>
- **New puzzle types**: Some concepts can be tricky to motivate. Our new “Collector” puzzle type (left) lets students freely try to collect as much treasure as they can. After learning loops, students will find out how much more treasure they can collect with the power of loops. The farmer (right) is an old friend, but she now grows corn, lettuce, and pumpkins! With conditional statements, the farmer can be programmed to pick the right type of veggie.

- <img src="/images/csfundamentalspilot/unpluggedbridge.png" align="right" width="50%"/>**Bridging Activities from Unplugged → Plugged**: The lesson plans for plugged stages on Code Studio now contain new guidance and a paper block toolkit that can be used to practice coding with blocks with your students offline before bringing them to the online puzzles!  <br><br>

### Piloting the updates: What’s there, what’s not

As these updates won’t be officially released until August 2017, there are a few things that do not exist in Courses A - F—as of right now.

- **Concept ramp-up stages**: We’ve drafted the “core” content of each course, which assumes that students have been exposed to the pathway of the previous courses. We know, though, that in the first years of implementation and for new students who join your class, they will not have completed all of the previous courses. In the Spring, we will be adding ramp-up stages to each course that will ensure coverage of any necessary concepts. Because these don’t exist right now, there are some recommended prerequisites for teachers and students who want to pilot the updated courses this winter/spring. Follow the table below to figure out if your class is a good fit to try the courses this winter/spring:

| Course |Recommended Student prerequisites |
| :------------------:|-----------|
| *Courses A, B, C, and D* | None |
| *Course E* | Concepts needed: Loops, conditionals (if/else statements)<br>Recommended prerequisite: [Course 2](http://studio.code.org/s/course2) |
| *Course F* | Concepts needed: Loops, conditionals (if/else statements), functions <br>Recommended prerequisite: [Course 3](http://studio.code.org/s/course3) |

- **Assessment support**: Available by full rollout in August<br><br>
- **Full teacher guides for plugged stages**: Available by full rollout in August. Right now there is a general lesson plan for all plugged stages with recommendations for journaling, bridging activities from unplugged activities, debugging, and more.
