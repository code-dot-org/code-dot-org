Overview and Professional Development

[/solid-block-header]

[col-50]

Our Computer Science Fundamentals courses each have about 15 lessons that may be implemented as one unit or over the course of a semester. Students create computer programs that will help them learn to collaborate with others, develop problem-solving skills, and persist through difficult tasks. They will study programming concepts, computational thinking, digital citizenship, and develop interactive games or stories they can share. 

All lessons align to all relevant computer science standards, as well as to the <a href="http://www.iste.org/standards/standards-for-students" target="_blank">ISTE standards</a>. They additionally reinforce concepts and skills taught in other subject areas by integrating national <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/Math/" target="_blank">Math</a>, <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/" target="_blank">English Language Arts</a>, and <a href="http://www.nextgenscience.org/next-generation-science-standards" target="_blank">Science</a> standards.

No worries! Most of our teachers have never taught computer science before. 

Try one of our courses yourself to learn ahead of your students. Sign up as a teacher to see the lesson plans, join the teacher forums, and get access to all the resources you need.

We also offer high-quality, 1-day workshops at no cost to you or your school. Join other teachers in your area for a hands-on intro to computer science, pedagogy, teacher dashboard, and strategies for teaching “unplugged” classroom activities.

# Selecting the Right Course For Your Class

<img src="/images/fit-970/CSFimages/CSF_Course_Map_Short.png" style="max-width: 100%"/>

For students new to computer science, each course begins with a grade-appropriate entry point and structured ramp-up of concepts. The progression of Courses A-F builds upon each other to ensure continuing students stay interested and learn new things. This allows you to use the same course at any grade level for all students, regardless of their experience. If you’re looking for a more comprehensive course, the Express Course combines the best of Courses A-F into a single condensed course (with a simpler option for pre-readers).

Lessons also teach students to collaborate with others meaningfully, investigate different problem-solving techniques, persist in the face of difficult tasks, and learn about internet safety. At the end of this course, students create their very own custom game or story they can share.

</div>

CS Fundamentals Express combines the best of Courses A-F into a single condensed course (with a simpler option for pre-readers). We recommend Courses A-F for most classrooms, but if your school only offers one computer science course or you want to have your students work through multiple courses in a single year, the Express course is a better choice. By removing the ramp up between years, the express course provides a smoother path and doesn’t repeat puzzles for students. This is also our recommended option for students studying computer science on their own outside of a classroom.

# Looking for Translated Courses?

We are working on translating the Courses A-F and the Express Course to languages beyond English. In the meantime, we recommend using [Courses 1-4 and the Accelerated Course](/educate/curriculum/cs-fundamentals-international). These courses cover the same basic concepts and have already been translated into 25+ languages.
