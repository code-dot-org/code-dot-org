## Free Professional Learning 

To help teachers implement our courses for grades K-5, Code.org offers high-quality, 1-day workshops for educators and content-area teachers (librarians, tech-ed specialists, etc.). These workshops are led by experienced Code.org facilitators in locations across the United States. If you are located outside the US, try our [self-paced, online course](/educate/professional-development-online).

Attendees learn how to use Code.org's courses to introduce computer science basics in a format that's fun and accessible to the youngest learners (grades K-5). Attendees also receive all the supplies they need to teach—at no cost.

## Curriculum Overview: Courses A-F

Our Computer Science (CS) Fundamentals curriculum consists of multiple courses, each of which has about 15 lessons that may be implemented as one unit or over the course of a semester. Learn more about each course below or download the complete curriculum guide [here](/curriculum/docs/k-5/complete.pdf). By the end of each course, students create interactive games or stories that they can share with anyone.

The courses are flexible, too, so educators can adjust them based on their students’ developmental level and prior experience. All lessons align to all relevant computer science standards, as well as to the <a href="http://www.iste.org/standards/standards-for-students" target="_blank">ISTE standards</a>. They additionally reinforce concepts and skills taught in other subject areas by integrating national <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/Math/" target="_blank">Math</a>, <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/" target="_blank">English Language Arts</a>, and <a href="http://www.nextgenscience.org/next-generation-science-standards" target="_blank">Science</a> standards. Read more about our [curriculum philosophy here](https://code.org/educate/curriculum-philosophy).

Course 4 is designed for students who have taken Courses 2 and 3. Students will learn how to tackle puzzles with increased complexity as they learn how to combine several concepts when solving each challenge. By the time this Course is completed, students will be creating programs that let them showcase multiple skills, including for loops and functions with parameters. Recommended for grades 4-8.
