Computer Science Discoveries is appropriate for 6-10th grade students and can be taught as a semester or year long introductory course (3-5 hours per week of instruction for 9+ weeks). The course takes a wide lens on computer science by covering topics such as programming, physical computing, HTML/CSS, and data. Students engage with computer science as a medium for creativity, communication, problem solving, and fun. The course inspires students as they build their own websites, apps, games, and physical computing devices.

For a lightweight option that can be integrated as a unit in an existing technology or programming class, or as a middle school after-school program, Code.org offers the the 30-hour Express Course. This course covers all the core concepts from the elementary school curriculum [Computer Science Fundamentals](/educate/curriculum/elementary-school), but at an accelerated pace designed for students ages 10-18.

Code.org has partnered with the award-winning [Project GUTS](http://www.projectguts.org/) (Growing Up Thinking Scientifically) to help science teachers introduce computer science as a tool to teach modeling and simulation. This curriculum teaches computer science practices and concepts in the context of life, physical and earth sciences. CS in Science is based on a crosswalk identifying areas of overlap between the NGSS and Computer Science Teachers Association K-12 Computer Science Standards.

# For Algebra Classrooms

Code.org has partnered with [Bootstrap](http://www.bootstrapworld.org) to adapt their algebra aligned curriculum to a block based course which teaches algebraic and geometric concepts through computer programming. The lessons focus on concepts like order of operations, the Cartesian plane, function composition and definition, and solving word problems - all within the context of video game design.

# Computer science lessons in other subjects

Are you interested in a few lessons to demonstrate how computer science can be used in another subject area? Partners have created introductory tutorials as part of the Hour of Code. These provide an ideal way for a math, history, or other teacher to supplement their curriculum and let students explore the cross disciplinary aspects of computer science. Available for [science](https://hourofcode.com/learn?grade=6-8&subject=science), [math](https://hourofcode.com/learn?grade=6-8&subject=math), [social studies](https://hourofcode.com/learn?grade=6-8&subject=history), [language arts](https://hourofcode.com/learn?grade=6-8&subject=la), and [art/media/music](https://hourofcode.com/learn?grade=6-8&subject=art) classes.
