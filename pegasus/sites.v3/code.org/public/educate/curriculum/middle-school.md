# Middle School
Our current middle school curriculum focuses on a broad introduction to computer science topics. CS Discoveries, our newest course (to be released in 2017), will be a year-long or semester computer science course designed for middle school students. In addition, the online courses in our [Code Studio](http://studio.code.org) platform may be used at all grade levels. Read more about our [curriculum philosophy here](https://code.org/educate/curriculum-philosophy).

# Computer Science Discoveries
Computer Science Discoveries is a full-year introductory computer science survey course (can be implemented as two standalone semesters) targeted at upper middle school and lower high school. The course takes a wide lens on computer science by covering topics such as programming, physical computing, HTML/CSS, and data. Students are empowered to create authentic artifacts and engage with CS as a medium for creativity, communication, problem solving, and fun. This course will be piloted in Spring 2017, and will be rolling out Summer 2017.

# Computer Science Fundamentals - Accelerated

<img src="/images/code20hr.jpg">

Code.org offers a four course [Computer Science Fundamentals](https://studio.code.org) progression for elementary school students. If your students have not already taken all of these courses, the 20-hour accelerated course covers the core concepts from the first four courses at an accelerated pace designed for students ages 10-18. This can be worked into a middle school after-school program or as a unit in a technology or programming class.

# Computer Science in Science

<img src="<%= CDO.shared_image_url("courses/logo_science.png") %>">

<div> Code.org has partnered with the award-winning <a href="http://www.projectguts.org/">Project GUTS</a> (Growing Up Thinking Scientifically) to deliver a middle school science program consisting of four instructional modules and professional development for the introduction of computer science concepts into science classrooms within the context of modeling and simulation. The goal of the program is to situate computer science practices and concepts within the context of life, physical, and earth sciences, and to prepare students to pursue formal, year-long courses in computer science during high school. CS in Science is based on a crosswalk identifying areas of overlap between the NGSS and Computer Science Teachers Association K-12 Computer Science Standards.
<br><br>

<i>Note: Starting in the 2017-2018 school year, Code.org will not be offering professional development for this course.</i>

# For Algebra Classrooms

Code.org has partnered with [Bootstrap](http://www.bootstrapworld.org) to adapt their algebra aligned curriculum to a block based course which teaches algebraic and geometric concepts through computer programming. The lessons focus on concepts like order of operations, the Cartesian plane, function composition and definition, and solving word problems - all within the context of video game design. [Computer Science in Algebra Course A](/educate/algebra) is a ~10 hour, block based course available from Code.org. Or visit Bootstrap to explore their longer [Bootstrap:1](http://www.bootstrapworld.org/materials/spring2016/index.shtml) and [Bootstrap:2](http://www.bootstrapworld.org/materials/spring2016/index.shtml) courses which teach more mathematical and programming concepts. By shifting classwork from abstract pencil-and-paper problems to a series of relevant programming problems, these courses demonstrate how algebra applies in the real world, using an exciting, hands-on approach to create something cool.
