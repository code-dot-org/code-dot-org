## For school counselors and administrators
[NCWIT Counselors for Computing (C4C)](https://www.ncwit.org/c4c) provides school counselors with
up-to-date information and resources they can use to guide students toward education and
careers in computing. Free professional development webinars and 1-day workshops are available
across the US.   

## Funding for computer science programs

U.S. Federal law recently recognized [computer science as part of the "well rounded education subjects"](http://blog.code.org/post/134932134563/sweeping-us-education-law-adds-computer-science), and explicitly [names computer science as an important STEM field](http://blog.code.org/post/130358071518/computer-science-is-finally-included-in-stem).

Your school or district may be able to use Title I or Title II funds, and other department grant programs to apply towards offering CS courses. [More info](http://innovation.ed.gov/2015/12/07/a-new-chapter-for-computer-science-education/).

The National Science Foundation (NSF) has several existing funding opportunities to support CS for All initiatives. The NSF outlined invitations for proposals in a [Dear Colleague Letter](http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf16057) issued in March 2016. If you are an organization focused on the learning of computer science and computational thinking for all students, consider [submitting a proposal](http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf16057).

## How were resources chosen for listing on this page?
To decide which resources to list here, we used a rubric that looked for:

 * Full-service partnerships
      * This page is primarily focused on full curriculum + professional development partners that a school or school district can use to provide a full, in-school offering for their students.
 * High quality of curriculum
 * Proven scale + support (in use in at least 100 schools)
 * Professional development & support for teachers included
 * Affordable

There was a degree of subjective editorial choices involved, because what's most important to us is to showcase a short list of resources that we believe will provide the best experience
for educators visiting our site. If you would like your course to be considered for the Fall 2017 review process, which will utilize external reviewers, [please fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScfsDH3-7PmtO48KCVKHg8vQ8r8uAHDPuoyAuLCXtNqyXPfxg/viewform?usp=send_form).
