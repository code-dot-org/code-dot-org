## Funding for computer science programs

U.S. Federal law recently recognized [computer science as part of the "well rounded education subjects"](http://blog.code.org/post/134932134563/sweeping-us-education-law-adds-computer-science), and explicitly [names computer science as an important STEM field](http://blog.code.org/post/130358071518/computer-science-is-finally-included-in-stem).

Your school or district may be able to use Title I or Title II funds, and other department grant programs to apply towards offering CS courses. [More info](http://innovation.ed.gov/2015/12/07/a-new-chapter-for-computer-science-education/).

The National Science Foundation (NSF) has several existing funding opportunities to support CS for All initiatives. The NSF outlined invitations for proposals in a [Dear Colleague Letter](http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf16057) issued in March 2016. If you are an organization focused on the learning of computer science and computational thinking for all students, consider [submitting a proposal](http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf16057).
