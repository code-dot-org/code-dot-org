# Exploring Computer Science #

Code.org has chosen to partner with Exploring Computer Science (ECS) to offer it to schools as our introductory high school computer science course. It is a nationally recognized introductory college preparatory computer science course designed to broaden participation in computing. The ECS curriculum and the professional development promotes an inquiry-based approach to teaching and learning essential computer science concepts, while highlighting the computational practices and problem solving associated with doing computer science. ECS opens a door for students to explore what computer science is and gives them a positive exposure to computer science.

| Unit | Description |
| :------------------:|-----------|
|**Unit 1: Human Computer Interaction**| Students are introduced to the major components of the computer, including: input, output, memory, storage, processing, software, and the operating system. Students consider how Internet elements (e.g. email, chat, WWW) are organized, engage in effective searching, and focus on productive use of email. Fundamental notions of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and ergonomics are introduced. Students learn that “intelligent” machine behavior is not “magic” but is based on algorithms applied to useful representations of information. Students learn the characteristics that make certain tasks easy or difficult for computers, and how these differ from those that humans characteristically find easy or difficult. Students gain an appreciation for the many ways (types of use) in which computers have had an impact across the range of human activity, as well as for the many different fields in which they are used. Examples illustrate the broad, interdisciplinary utility of computers and algorithmic problem solving in the modern world. |
|**Unit 2**| **Problem Solving** This unit covers the basic steps in algorithmic problem-solving, including the problem statement and exploration, examination of sample instances, design, program coding, testing, and verification. Tools for expressing design are used. This unit also includes selected topics in discrete mathematics including (but not limited to) Boolean logic, functions, sets, and graphs. Students are introduced to the binary number system. Students construct complex expressions based on fundamental Boolean operations and learn how to relate the mathematical notion of functions to its counterparts in computer programming. They learn basic set theory and its application in computer science. Students are introduced to graphs using puzzles. Suitable exercises are presented that illustrate the value of mathematical abstraction in solving programming problems.|
|3| **Web Design** This section prepares students to take the role of a developer by expanding their knowledge of programming and Web page design and applying it to the creation of Web pages, programs, and documentation for users and equipment. Students learn to create user-friendly manuals, Web sites, and program interfaces. Students apply fundamental notions of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and ergonomics. Code documentation and hardware and software limitations are also explored. The notions of hierarchy and abstraction are central to computing. They are crucial to the translation between machine code and a user-friendly interface, to creating reusable code, and to the design of software that is broadly applicable rather than solving only a narrowly defined problem. This unit makes these abstract ideas concrete by focusing first on real-life (non-computing) examples, and then on the specific uses of hierarchy and abstraction in computer science.|
|4| **Programming** Students continue to work together to invent solutions and protocols to many of the problems that arise in the structure and function of the Internet. Topics include the Internet Protocol, DNS, TCP/IP, cryptography and other security and hacking concerns. Topics include: encryption, security, computationally hard problems, and internet protocols|
|5| **Computing and Data Analysis** Students learn the fundamentals programming constructs of javascript by solving problems with “turtle graphics.”  Then move on to programming simple event driven apps.  An emphasis is placed on enabling students to solve problems and write code in teams. |
|6| **Robotics** Students continue programming and building web apps, now with a view towards data: processing it with algorithms, and the implications of storing data collected from and by others on the web.  Students explore “big data” by making queries against a data analysis api.|

## Frequently Asked Questions

<br />


#### How/Where can I get professional development for this course?

In-person professional development for the Code.org CSP course will be available in select partner districts starting in summer 2015. After one year of piloting and refining the PD program we will make all of our PD agendas, schedules, and other materials available to the public. This includes all of our online and in-person PD programs.

<br><br>

#### How can I participate in the ECS teacher community?

Code.org’s [Teacher Community](/educate/community) has a [special forum](http://forum.code.org/c/ecs) and set of [monthly meetings](/educate/ecs-201516meetings) for our ECS teachers. You can learn more and get involved today, regardless of whether you are currently enrolled in our In-person PD.
