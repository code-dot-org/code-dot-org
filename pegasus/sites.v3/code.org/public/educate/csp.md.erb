# Why should you teach CS Principles with Code.org?

## It's endorsed by the College Board.

<img src="../files/apcsp_providerbadge_sm_alpha_2020.png" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; width: 100px" alt="Code.org AP CSP Endorsed Badge">Code.org is recognized by the <a href="http://collegeboard.org/APCSP", target=_"blank">College Board</a> as an endorsed provider of curriculum and professional development for AP® Computer Science Principles. This endorsement affirms that all components of Code.org's CS Principles offerings are aligned to the AP Curriculum Framework standards and the AP CS Principles assessment. This affords schools access to resources including an <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dzsY0lTCx8XpNAdZ2d19FdUO3HEg37up/view" target=_blank> AP CS Principles syllabus</a> pre-approved by the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yqs0mG_oKWZcfCdiuy3u5Ew8y9-QXyqAHQeE0yr7Stw/view" target=_blank> College Board’s AP Course Audit </a>, and officially recognized professional development that prepares teachers to teach this curriculum.

## It's backed by research.

<a href="https://medium.com/@codeorg/cs-helps-students-outperform-in-school-college-and-workplace-66dd64a69536">Six different studies show</a>: students who study computer science perform better in other subjects, excel at problem-solving, and are more likely to attend college.

Students who take AP Computer Science Principles, in particular, are <a href="https://medium.com/@codeorg/study-computer-science-students-much-more-likely-to-enroll-in-college-faca65b1476d">12% more likely to enroll in college</a> compared to similarly-situated peers, and students who take AP exams are <a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED519365.pdf">more likely to graduate 4-year college</a>, regardless of their score on the exam. AP computer science students also earn <a href="https://blog.code.org/post/125429946375/cs-other-subjects">better AP Calculus scores</a> than comparable students who don’t take AP computer science.

## <a name="overview"></a>CS Principles is designed for beginners.

Our team designed the CS Principles curriculum to support students and teachers new to the discipline. The curriculum includes daily lesson plans made up of inquiry-based activities, videos, assessments, and computing tools, allowing teachers to guide and learn alongside students as they discover core computing concepts.

Every lesson plan and activity is tested by a diverse mix of classrooms around the country to make sure it’s appropriate and engaging for all students.

</details>

<details style="margin-left: 20px">
	<summary style="font-size: 18px">What is the recommended timing for teaching CS Principles?</summary>
	<p>
	<br/>
We recommend that CS Principles be taught as a full year class, assuming that you meet with students daily or nearly daily for 45 or more minutes.

It is possible to teach CS Principles on a semester block schedule, though we highly recommend this implementation only be used in the fall semester. Since the AP Performance Tasks are due in late April and require 20 dedicated hours of class time to complete, most schools find there is not enough time to complete the course on a block schedule in the spring.

</details>

<details style="margin-left: 20px">
	<summary style="font-size: 18px"><a name="materials"></a>What materials do I need for CS Principles?</summary>
	<p>
	<br/>
**Required Materials:**

CS Principles requires that students have access to computers with a modern web browser. At this time, our courses are not optimized for tablets or mobile devices. For more details, check out [Code.org's technology requirements](/educate/it).

Many lessons have handouts that are designed to guide students through activities. While these handouts are not required, we highly recommend their use.

In addition to handouts, several lessons call for specific items. You can find these listed below as well as our suggestions for alternatives:

- **Unit 1, Lesson 2:** Assortment of craft materials for constructing physical devices. Recommendations: cups, string/yarn, construction paper, flashlights, slinkies, noise makers, markers, and glue, etc. <i>Alternative: none.</i>
- **Unit 2, Lesson 2:**  String for table groups to build a network connecting them. <i>Alternative: Students draw their network but don't actually build it.</i>
- **Unit 3, Lesson 5:** A handful of LEGO® blocks for every pair of students. <i>Alternative: Sticky notes, construction paper.</i>
- **Unit 4, Lessons 1 & 5:** Plastic bags, sticky notes, dry erase markers. <i>Alternative: Envelopes.</i>
- **Unit 5, Lesson 1:** Plastic bags, gallon-sized plastic bags, sticky notes, dry erase markers, tape. <i>Alternative: Envelopes.</i>
- **Unit 6, Lessons 2 & 3:** Sticky notes. <i>Alternative: Scraps of paper.</i>
- **Unit 6, Lesson 4:** Decks of cards. <i>Alternative: Any item that could be combined into two categories (e.g. change with even / odd year).</i>
- **Unit 7, Lessons 1 & 5:** Sticky notes, envelopes, plastic bags, file folders. <i>Alternative: Scraps of paper, folders made of a folded sheet of paper, etc.</i>

**Optional Materials**

The following supplies are completely optional but will be useful to have on hand for various lessons:

- Graph paper
- Chart paper
- Markers
- Post-it notes

<details style="margin-left: 20px">
	<summary style="font-size: 18px">How was the curriculum developed?</summary>
	<p>
	<br/>
Our CS Principles curriculum has always been designed as part of a broader vision of supporting high quality, engaging, and equitable computer science instruction in classrooms across the country. Our <a href="https://code.org/educate/curriculum/values", target=_"blank">Curriculum Values</a> continue to guide us, and in particular our focus on expanding access to those who historically have been denied opportunities to learn about the exciting and impactful field of computing.

While our vision and values remain unchanged, the landscape of CS education is rapidly developing. For the 2020-21 school year the College Board has made some significant updates to the CS Principles framework and AP assessment to ensure that CS Principles remains relevant and aligned with equivalent university courses. CS education research continues to reveal new insights on how students learn about computing, and feedback from the thousands of classrooms now using our CS Principles curriculum has identified opportunities to further improve our courses, tools, and recommended pedagogy. The goal of the updates to our curriculum is to navigate these developments in a way that remains committed to our vision and values and supports the many teachers, schools, classrooms, and districts that are already a part of our broader CS Principles community. We remain deeply thankful for you joining us on this mission to make our collective vision a reality.
