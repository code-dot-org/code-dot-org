# What is a Regional Partner?
Code.org is selecting organizations to become Regional Partners.  These partners will help support and prepare local teachers to bring computer science to their classrooms in a sustainable fashion. The goal of the Regional Partner program is to help each organization establish itself as a local leader in the Code.org professional learning community, with an expectation that in the long-run each partner organization can sustain this work independently of Code.org.

The ideal Regional Partner is a regional education unit, a nonprofit, university, or educational service district with existing, positive relationships with nearby school districts and the local education community.

**Application Deadline for the Regional Partner program extended till April 6, 2018!**

## For districts or schools
[Over 120 school districts](/educate/district/partners) across the country use Code.org’s curriculum to teach almost 10% of all U.S. students, and almost 15% of the nation's Black and Latinx students. Your district or school can work with code.org and our partners to bring full computer science courses to every student.
