# Become a Computer Science Fundamentals Facilitator

Code.org is looking to partner with experienced computer science educators to deliver one-day, in-person workshops to local elementary school teachers to teach computer science in a format that's fun and accessible.

The ideal CS Fundamentals Facilitator is an enthusiastic supporter of computer science education, possesses a connection to Code.org’s equity-focused mission and has a strong background in the curriculum area, preferably through past teaching experience. Experience mentoring teachers and managing/hosting professional development workshops a plus. **Applicants who meet the facilitator criteria who live in a region where Code.org has Professional Learning or District Partners will be prioritized for acceptance.**

## What is the CS Fundamentals Facilitator Program?

Code.org has developed an online [Computer Science curriculum for Elementary School](/k5) students comprised of Courses 1, 2, 3 and 4, which are free and publicly available at through [studio.code.org](http://studio.code.org). Our goal is to spread this curricula to tens of thousands of classrooms across the US through the development and implementation of a train-the-trainer model for teacher professional development.  

We implemented this model in September 2014 with 80 facilitators nationwide. So far, approximately 20,000 teachers have participated and have rated our workshops a 4.8 on a 5 point scale. The majority say, “It’s the best professional development I’ve ever attended.” 

For each workshop you host, CS Fundamentals Facilitators will receive a per-teacher budget to cover your costs, and also to compensate you as well as any teaching assistants. We will also provide the materials (at no cost) needed to host the workshop including take home supplies for teachers. 

## How to become a CS Fundamentals Facilitator?
Become a CS Fundamentals Facilitator by attending Code.org's all expense paid Facilitator Summit May 20-22, 2016 (location TBD). At the Summit, Code.org will prepare facilitators to deliver their own one-day, in-person workshops to local educators interested in teaching the Code.org CS Fundamentals curriculum.

Once you become an official CS Fundamentals Facilitator, you can host workshops listed on the [Code.org professional development page](/professional-development-workshops), and together we will recruit elementary school teachers to attend these workshops to offer computer science modules in their classrooms. 

Before applying please carefully review the the criteria, requirements and commitments for the CS Fundamentals Facilitator program.
