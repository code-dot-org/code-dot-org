## What is the K5 Affiliate Program?

Code.org has developed an online [Computer Science curriculum for Elementary School](/k5) students comprised of Courses 1, 2 and 3, which are free and publicly available at through [studio.code.org](http://studio.code.org). Our goal is to spread this curricula to tens of thousands of classrooms across the US through the development and implementation of a train-the-trainer model for teacher professional development.  

We implemented this model in September 2014 with 80 affiliates nationwide. So far, approximately 6,000 teachers have participated and have rated our workshops a 4.8 on a 5 point scale. The majority say, “It’s the best professional development I’ve ever attended.” 

## How do you become a K5 Affiliate?
Become a Code.org K-5 Affiliate by attending a 2-day, expense-paid workshop in Chicago, Illinois  (July 17-19th). Code.org will prepare you to deliver your own one-day, in-person workshops to local educators interested in teaching the Code.org K-5 curriculum.

Once you become an official Code.org Affiliate, you can host workshops that will be listed on the [Code.org professional development page](/professional-development-workshops), and together we will recruit elementary school teachers to attend these workshops in order to offer computer science modules in their classrooms. 

## What does a Code.org K-5 Affiliate receive?
For each workshop you host, Code.org Affiliates will receive a per-teacher budget to cover your costs, and also to compensate you as well as any teaching assistants. We will also provide the materials (at no cost) needed to host the workshop including take home supplies for teachers. 

## Are you interested? 
Apply to become a Code.org Affiliate and host workshops for K-5 teachers in your region.
