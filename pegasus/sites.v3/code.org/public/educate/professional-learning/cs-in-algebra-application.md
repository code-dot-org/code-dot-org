# Computer Science in Algebra Application 

We're so excited that you are interested in applying for our Professional Learning Program for CS in Algebra. Space for the 2016-17 school year is limited, so be sure to get your application in soon.
## Who is eligible?
Please note that this application is for teachers from districts that have partnerships with Code.org. If your district does not have a partnership, contact [Bootstrap](http://www.bootstrapworld.org/workshops/), our preferred professional development provider for CS in Algebra.

**Some of our district partners have their own application process.**  If you do not see your district on the application [click on your district's pin on the map](/educate/professional-learning/cs-in-algebra-apply) to find the appropriate form.

**Note about Principal Approval.** This application requires your school’s principal to provide their electronic signature. We recommend reviewing the application with your principal and completing the application together in the same room. NOTE: You cannot save and return to the application later.
