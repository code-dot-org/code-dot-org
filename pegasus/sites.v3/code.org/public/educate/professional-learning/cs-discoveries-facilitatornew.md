## What is the CS Discoveries Facilitator Program?

CS Discoveries is an introductory Computer Science course that empowers students to create authentic artifacts and engage with computer science as a medium for creativity, communication, problem solving, and fun. The course will be piloted in Spring 2017 and will fully rollout in the 2017-2018 school year.

CS Discoveries Facilitators accepted to the program will work with a local Code.org [Professional Learning Partner](https://code.org/educate/professional-learning-partner/partners) (a higher education institution, a nonprofit or an education focused governmental agency) to plan and lead the following workshops for local teachers in their regions:

- Four 1-day, in-person workshops during the 2017-18 school year (typically on Saturday)
- One 5-day workshop in summer 2018
