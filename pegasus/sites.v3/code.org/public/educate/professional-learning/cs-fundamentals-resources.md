**Subject Line:** Bring computer science to our school district!

Dear [Insert Name]

Computer science is foundational knowledge for all students in the 21st century. But a lot of schools don’t teach it, especially at the elementary level.

But now our elementary schools can, at no cost, with the help of Code.org. [Learn more](/educate/k5-district-partnership).

Code.org is looking to [partner with school districts](/educate/k5-district-partnership) to prepare a Facilitator (chosen by the district) to deliver one-day, in-person workshops to district elementary school teachers to teach computer science in a format that's fun and accessible. 

If accepted, Code.org would cover all costs of training the Facilitator, and would provide, free of charge, the Code Studio curriculum, supplies needed to host the workshops, including take home materials for attending teachers such as a printed curriculum guide, classroom supplies to teach the unplugged activities and fun Code.org swag.

In return, the district would be responsible for identifying a member of the district staff to facilitate the Code Studio professional development workshops and prepare district teachers to offer the Code Studio curriculum broadly within grades K-5.

As a member of our community I strongly urge our school district [apply to partner](/educate/k5-district-partnership) with Code.org to bring these life-changing skills to our children! [Sign up](/educate/k5-district-partnership)!

Sincerely,

Regardless of what subject you teach, incorporating computer science into your classroom will give your students a huge leg up. Besides, this is a subject the kids love learning.
