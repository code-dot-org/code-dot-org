<a name="why"></a>
## Why should I apply?

The majority of our workshop attendees rank it the **best professional development ever.** Over 90% of attendees would recommend our program to another teacher.

**No experience needed!** Whether you are new to teaching computer science (CS) or have experience teaching other CS courses, the Code.org Professional Learning Program offers year round support. We’ve designed this program to promote growth by providing space for you to become comfortable with curricular materials, CS content, and pedagogy.

**Over a third of schools** use Code.org's curriculum, including the largest school districts in the U.S., such as LAUSD, Broward, and Dallas ISD. And, over a quarter of our teachers come from rural schools.

**Proven results** - peer reviewed research shows that school participation in the Code.org program causes an estimated 5x increase in students that take and pass the AP Computer Science Principles exam.

**Every Student Succeeds Act**. The Code.org program meets the six key criteria for professional development outlined in the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). Learn more in our [Program Brochure](/files/programs/codeorg-program-brochure.pdf).
