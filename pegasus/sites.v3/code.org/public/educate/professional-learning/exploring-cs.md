# Exploring Computer Science Professional Learning Program

The Code.org Exploring Computer Science (ECS) Professional Learning Program supports teachers with diverse teaching backgrounds. Whether you are new to teaching CS or you have CS teaching experience outside this course, the program is designed to promote growth in your teaching practice, providing space for teachers to become comfortable with the curricular materials and associated teaching strategies. 

## What does a Code.org Exploring Computer Science educator do?
If accepted into the Exploring Computer Science Professional Learning Program, you will:

- Join a nationwide community of educators working to change the face of CS education 
- Participate in in-person and online professional development
- Plan and deliver the ECS curriculum to your students, and reflect on your experiences 
 
 
## <a name="components"></a>How does it work?
The program has four phases: 

- **Phase 1:** Online Introduction - The first phase of professional development is a two-hour online introduction that focuses on providing a foundational knowledge of the ECS course resources. It creates a space for participants to become familiar with the curriculum and the online professional learning platform- 
- **Phase 2:** Summer Study - This 5-day workshop is the primary capacity building experience for teachers prior to their first year of instruction. Participants will explore curriculum, tools, classroom management, and teaching strategies. Spending practical time working with the curriculum, you will develop an understanding of how to effectively use the materials and pedagogical strategies that are part of any strong computer science classroom.
- **Phase 3:** Academic Year Development - These quarterly meetings along with ongoing online support will continue to build pedagogical strategies and explore the essential elements of this course. You will participate in activities such as teaching new content and keeping the classroom environment equitable and engaging for all students. Additionally, the courses introduce opportunities to build a collaborative professional online learning community â€” an important teacher tool during the first-year of teaching this course.
- **Phase 4:** Wrap up and Transition to CS Discoveries - In this culminating workshop, teachers reflect on their first year teaching ECS, and make a plan for the second year. Starting in Fall 2017, teachers will have the option to teach [CS Discoveries](/educate/csd), an introductory course for 7th-9th grade students created by Code.org that brings together the power of our teaching and learning tools with the educational philosophies of ECS. At this workshop, teachers will have a chance to learn about this new course and how it might fit into their school.
