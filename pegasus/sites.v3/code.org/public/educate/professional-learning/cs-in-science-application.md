# Computer Science in Science Application 

We're so excited that you are interested in applying for our Professional Learning Program for CS in Science. Space for the 2016-17 school year is limited, so be sure to get your application in soon.
## Who is eligible?
Please note that this application is for teachers from districts that have partnerships with Code.org. If your district does not have a partnership, please complete our [Single School Application](https://form.jotform.com/61175565477162) and we'll let you know if space opens up.


**Some of our district partners have their own application process.**  If you do not see your district on the application [click on your district's pin on the map](/educate/professional-learning/cs-in-science-apply) to find the appropriate form.


**Note about Principal Approval.** This application requires your schoolâ€™s principal to provide their electronic signature. We recommend reviewing the application with your principal and completing the application together in the same room. NOTE: You cannot save and return to the application later.
