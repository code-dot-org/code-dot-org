# Exploring Computer Science Application 

We're so excited that you are interested in applying for our Professional Learning Program for Exploring Computer Science. Space for the 2016-17 school year is limited, so be sure to get your application in soon.
## Who is eligible?
Please note that this application is for teachers from districts that have partnerships with Code.org. If your district does not have a partnership, please complete our <a href="https://form.jotform.com/60746479314159" target=_blank>Single School Application</a> and we'll let you know if space opens up. In the meantime, consider sending your administrators <a href="https://code.org/educate/districts" target=_blank>information about how to become a partner.</a>

**Some of our district partners have their own application process.**  If you do not see your district on the application [click on your district's pin on the map](/educate/professional-learning/exploring-cs-apply) to find the appropriate form.

## What is the application period? 
**March 31st is our Priority 1 deadline.** Applications recieved before March 31st from teachers in partner districts will be considered before we start opening up spots to our waitlist in April. 

**April 22nd is the final application deadline.** Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis, and you can expect to hear back from us with 10 - 14 business days.

**Note about principal approval.** This application requires your schoolâ€™s principal to provide their electronic signature. We recommend reviewing the application with your principal and completing the application together in the same room. NOTE: You cannot save and return to the application later.
