Our CS Discoveries Professional Learning program offers year round support designed for educators teaching a semester or full-year course. You don't need any prior computer science experience to get started! 

The program kicks off with 5-day summer workshop where you'll have the opportunity to work hands-on with the [CS Discoveries curriculum](/educate/csd). Throughout the year, we offer online support for upcoming units, forum support, and 1-day quarterly workshops. For more information about our goals and approach to professional learning, check out our [professional learning values](/educate/professional-learning/values). Print a [flyer](/files/PLProgramsOverview_1-Pager.pdf) to share with teachers or administrators at your school.

<details>
  <summary>**Cost should not be a barrier**</summary>
  <p>
<br>
We are a nonprofit dedicated to helping schools teach computer science. In most states, our professional learning is offered at *no cost to you or your school*.

In New York and North Carolina, there is a fee to cover the costs of the workshop. But, we have worked with many school districts in these regions and they have allocated funds to cover the costs for you and your school. If your principal or administration has any questions around the costs to support this, please encourage them to reach out to our partners in <a href="mailto:programs@codeinteractive.org">New York</a> and <a href="mailto:srmorri3@ncsu.edu">North Carolina</a> so we can help you.

## <a name="components"></a>How does it work?
The program has two components: 

- **5-day Summer Workshop** (dates and locations vary by district) - An intensive, hands-on, in-person workshop providing foundational experiences with computer science and the Code.org suite of tools. The week-long workshop is the primary capacity building experience for teachers prior to their first year of instruction. Participants will explore the curriculum and tools, consider and experiment with specific classroom management and teaching strategies, and build a local community of teachers who are using this curriculum.
- **Continuing Professional Development** (held over 4 days, totaling 24 professional development hours; local, in-person workshops take place throughout the following academic hear, usually on Saturdays) - A menu of online and local in-person professional development options from which educators can build a customized personal learning pathway. This phase of the program is blended, with ongoing in-person meetings as well as online activities.
     - The in-person meetings are run by local facilitators. They focus on the essential elements of the course, such as teaching new content, keeping the classroom environment equitable and engaging, and continuing to build pedagogical strategies.
     - The online activities are focused on building the online professional learning community, providing continued support with tools and content, introducing new and helpful resources for teaching the course, and further exploring the curriculum.
