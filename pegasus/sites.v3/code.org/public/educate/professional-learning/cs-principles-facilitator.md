## What is the CSP Facilitator Program?
Code.org has developed a year-long introductory Advance Placement (AP®) Computer Science Principles course for high school students. The curriculum is written to support students and teachers new to the discipline with inquiry-based activities, videos, assessment support, and computing tools that have built-in tutorials and student pacing guides. 

CSP Facilitators accepted to the program will work with Code.org’s local Professional Learning Partner organization (a higher education institution, a nonprofit or a school district) to plan and lead at least 4, 1-day, in-person workshops for local teachers in their regions during the 2016-17 school year. 

For each workshop you host, CSP Facilitators will receive compensation for facilitating. We will also provide the venue, materials and food (at no cost) needed to host the workshop.
