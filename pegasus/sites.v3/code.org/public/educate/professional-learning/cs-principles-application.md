# Computer Science Principles Application  

We're so excited that you are interested in applying for our Professional Learning Program for CS Principles. Space for the 2016-17 school year is limited, so be sure to get your application in soon.
## Who is eligible?
Please note that this application is for teachers from districts that have partnerships with Code.org. If your district does not have a partnership, please add your information to our <a href="https://form.jotform.com/53365196731157" target=_blank>wait-list</a> and we'll let you know if space opens up. In the meantime, consider sending your administrators <a href="https://code.org/educate/districts" target=_blank>information about how to become a partner.</a>

**Some of our district partners have their own application process.**  If you do not see your district on the application [click on your district's pin on the map](/educate/professional-learning/cs-principles-apply) to find the appropriate form.
## What is the application period? 
Our Priority 1 deadline closed at the end of February. Our Priority 2 deadline is the end of March. Applications from partner districts recieved before March 31st will be considered before we start opening up spots to our waitlist in April. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis, and you can expect to hear back from us with 10 - 14 business days. If you are accepted, you will receive additional information about travel, logistics, and registration for your designated summer in-person summit date.
