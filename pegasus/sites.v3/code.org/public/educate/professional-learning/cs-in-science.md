An introduction, life, physical, and earth science modules are blended together to showcase the connection between computer science modeling and traditional middle school science curriculum. 


## What does a Code.org CS in Science Educator do?
If accepted into the Code.org CS in Science Professional Learning Program, you will:

- Join a nationwide community of educators working to change the face of CS education 
- Participate in in-person and online professional development

## <a name="components"></a>How does it work?
The Code.org CS in Science professional learning program is built around development and curriculum that flow together seamlessly, representing a cohesive set of resources that empower teachers to deliver the course with confidence. Code.org has partnered with the award-winning Project GUTS (Growing Up Thinking Scientifically) to deliver a middle school science program consisting of four instructional modules and accompanying development for the introduction of CS concepts into science classrooms within the context of modeling and simulation.  

The goal of this professional learning program is to help teachers to introduce CS practices and concepts within the context of life, physical, and earth sciences. Many of the supports, including videos, curriculum, and the standards crosswalk (both CSTA and NGSS) are available from the [CS in Science homepage](<%= CDO.code_org_url('/curriculum/science') %>).
