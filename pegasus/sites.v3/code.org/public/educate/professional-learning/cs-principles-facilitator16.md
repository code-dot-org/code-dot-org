## What is the CS Principles Facilitator Program?

Code.org developed a year-long introductory Advance Placement (AP®) Computer Science Principles course for high school students. The curriculum is written to support students and teachers new to the discipline with inquiry-based activities, videos, assessment support, and computing tools that have built-in tutorials and student pacing guides.<br/>

CS Principles Facilitators accepted to the program will work with a local Code.org [Professional Learning Partner](/educate/professional-learning-partner/partners) (a higher education institution, a nonprofit or an education focused governmental agency) to plan and lead the following workshops for local teachers in their regions:

- Four 1-day, in-person workshops during the 2017-18 school year (typically on Saturday)
- One 5-day workshop in summer 2018
