"I am completely new and a beginner to Computer Science and was very intimidated prior to this workshop. My facilitators were excellent and made me feel included and confident. (...) I am looking forward to using the CODE.org resources and curriculum to provide my students with a fair and equitable classroom. I am ready and inspired to build this program at my school."
