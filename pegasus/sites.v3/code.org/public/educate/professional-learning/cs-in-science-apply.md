# Find the Computer Science in Science program near you
We welcome teachers to sign up for the Computer Science in Science (CS in Science) Professional Learning Program. CS in Science is a multi-phase program developed by Project GUTS, designed to make it easy to integrate computer modeling and simulation into middle school science classrooms. The professional learning program provides curriculum, tools, and teaching practices that will help teachers engage their students in the powerful scientific practice of computational thinking! 

## Where is CS in Science offered?

The CS in Science professional learning program is open to teachers in partner districts who are interested in teaching the course. Check to see if your district has partnered to make CS in Science available in your region for the 2016-2017 school year. If you live in Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Utah, or Virginia, your district is covered by a statewide partnership. Click on the icon in your state to apply.
