**2016 Application Update: The application process closed March 15th. We are reviewing applications and accepting facilitators on a rolling basis through April 22nd. We will update everyone of their acceptance status by April 22nd.**

Code.org is looking to partner with individuals interested in developing facilitation capacity in computer science education to deliver high-quality professional development to teachers to teach computer science in a format that's fun and accessible.

The ideal facilitator is an enthusiastic supporter of computer science education, possesses a connection to Code.org’s equity-focused mission and has a strong background in the curriculum area, preferably through past teaching experience. Experience mentoring teachers and managing/hosting professional development workshops a plus. <br/>

## What is Code.org's Facilitator Development Program?

Code.org's Facilitator Development Program is a highly-selective professional learning program designed to prepare and support facilitators to deliver high-quality professional development on Code.org's curriculum.

Accepted participants will attend an all expense paid trip to Code.org's Facilitator Summit May 20-22, 2016 in New Orleans, LA. During the Summit, Code.org will provide instruction to prepare facilitators to deliver professional development to teachers on the Code.org curriculum. **Applicants who meet the facilitator criteria who live in a region where Code.org has Professional Learning or District Partners will be prioritized for acceptance.** Please see individual program details for more information.

The Summit is designed to be a fabulous experience to welcome you to the extended Code.org family.

All focus areas share a basic framework and approach, drawn from adult learning theory and best practices for facilitation, that ensures participants are well prepared to lead high-quality training. However, each focus area’s training curriculum is designed for the specific needs of the teachers and students impacted by the program, and for that reason has its own unique selection criteria, requirements, commitments and benefits.
