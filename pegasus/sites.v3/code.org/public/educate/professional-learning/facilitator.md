# Become a Code.org Facilitator

Code.org is looking to partner with individuals interested in developing facilitation capacity in computer science education to deliver high-quality professional development to teachers in a format that's fun and accessible.


The ideal facilitator is an enthusiastic supporter of computer science education, possesses a connection to Code.org’s equity-focused mission and has a strong background in the curriculum area, preferably through teaching experience. Experience mentoring teachers and managing/hosting professional development workshops is a plus. The facilitator program is designed to be supplemental to a classroom teacher’s full-time teaching load, or a full-time teacher leadership role such as a coach or a teacher mentor.<br/>

## What is Code.org's Facilitator Development Program?

Code.org's Facilitator Development Program is a highly-selective professional learning program designed to prepare and support facilitators to deliver high-quality professional development on Code.org's curriculum.<br/>

Code.org will provide instruction to prepare facilitators to deliver professional development to teachers on the Code.org curriculum. **Applicants who meet the facilitator criteria and live in a region where Code.org has a [Professional Learning Partner](/educate/professional-learning-partner/partners) will be prioritized for acceptance.** Please see individual program details for more information.

In 2017-2018, Code.org will prepare facilitators in two areas. The focus areas share a basic framework and approach, drawn from adult learning theory and best practices for facilitation, that ensures participants are well prepared to lead high-quality training. However, each focus area’s training curriculum is designed for the specific needs of the teachers and students impacted by the program, and for that reason each has its own unique selection criteria, requirements, commitments and benefits.<br/>
