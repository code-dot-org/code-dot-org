# Facilitating with Code.org

Code.org partners with individuals interested in developing facilitation capacity in computer science education to deliver high-quality professional development to teachers in a format that's fun and accessible.

The ideal facilitator is an enthusiastic supporter of computer science education, possesses a connection to Code.org’s equity-focused mission and has a strong background in the curriculum area, preferably through teaching experience. Experience mentoring teachers and managing/hosting professional development workshops is a plus. The facilitator program is designed to be supplemental to a classroom teacher’s full-time teaching load, or a full-time teacher leadership role such as a coach or a teacher mentor.
