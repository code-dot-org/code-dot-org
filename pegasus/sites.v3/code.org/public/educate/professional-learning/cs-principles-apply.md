# Find the Computer Science Principles program near you
We welcome teachers to sign up for the Computer Science Principles (CS Principles) professional learning program, an intensive program for high school educators who are interested in teaching the CS Principles course. This program is designed to prepare educators to provide high quality instruction, based on the [CS Principles curriculum](/educate/csp), tools and approach to students in their classrooms.

## Don't teach in a partner district?

We will open the CSP Professional Learning Program to teachers from non-partner districts if there is space available.  Teachers who are selected from the wait-list will need to demonstrate a commitment to delivering the Code.org CSP course in their classroom during the 2016-17 school year by having a slot on their school's master schedule.
