# Find the Computer Science in Algebra program near you
We welcome teachers to sign up for the Code.org Computer Science in Algebra (CS in Algebra) professional learning program. CS in Algebra is designed to provide educators with the opportunity to increase content knowledge, skills, and pedagogy related to inquiry, equity, and specific Code.org course instruction. The model is structured to empower teachers by focusing on proper preparation, in-depth learning, feedback, reflection, and continuing education.

## Where is CS in Algebra offered?

The CS in Algebra professional learning program is open to teachers in partner districts who are interested in teaching the course. Check to see if your district has partnered to make CS in Algebra available in your region for the 2016-2017 school year. If you live in Idaho, Indiana or Virginia, your district is covered by a statewide partnership. Click on the icon in your state to apply.
