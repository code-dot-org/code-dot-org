## What is the ECS Facilitator Program?
The [Exploring Computer Science](http://www.exploringcs.org/) curriculum is a yearlong high school course designed to broaden participation in computer science. The course consists of 6 units, approximately 6 weeks each and was developed around a framework of both computer science content and computational practice. Assignments and instruction are contextualized to be socially relevant and meaningful for diverse students.

ECS Facilitators accepted to the program will work with Code.org’s local Professional Learning Partner organization (a higher education institution, a nonprofit or a school district) to plan and lead: 

- One 5-day in-person on-boarding workshop for local teachers in your region during the 2016-17 school year.
- Four 1-day in-person follow-up quarterly workshops for local teachers in your region during the 2016-17 school year.

For each workshop you host, ECS Facilitators will receive between $400-450 in compensation for facilitating. We will also provide the venue, materials and food (at no cost) needed to host the workshop.


## How to become an ECS Facilitator?
Become an ECS Facilitator by attending Code.org's all expense paid Facilitator Summit May 20-22, 2016 (New Orleans, LA). At the Summit and teacher training, Code.org will prepare facilitators to deliver the in-person workshops to local high school teachers enrolled in Code.org’s ECS Professional Learning Program throughout the 2016-2017 school year.
