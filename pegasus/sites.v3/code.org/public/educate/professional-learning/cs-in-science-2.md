# CS in Science Professional Learning Program #

Code.org has partnered with the [award-winning Project GUTS](http://www.projectguts.org/) (Growing Up Thinking Scientifically) to deliver a middle school science program consisting of four instructional modules. An introduction, life, physical, and earth science modules are blended together to showcase the connection between computer science modeling and traditional middle school science curriculum.
