### Increasing Access to CS Education: What Works, What Doesn't
#### Wednesday, October 14, 2015 from 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM (CDT) 
In this interactive discussion, you’ll hear from Pat Yongpradit, VP of Education at Code.org and Heather King, program manager at Outlier, about the results of our programs over the course of the 2014-15 school year. What did teachers take away from professional development? What did students learn? What did we learn from our district partnerships? Learn from our successes and challenges as we discuss how we might work together as a CS education community to increase access to CS education for all. See [https://code.org/about/evaluation/summary](https://code.org/about/evaluation/summary) and [http://outlier.uchicago.edu/evaluation_codeorg/](http://outlier.uchicago.edu/evaluation_codeorg/) for the reports.
