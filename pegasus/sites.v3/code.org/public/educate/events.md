### Ask Your Final Hour of Code Questions w/ Hadi Partovi
#### Wednesday, December 2, 2015 from 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM (CDT) 
To prepare for this year’s Hour of Code, we’re organizing a special chat with Hadi Partovi, co-founder of Code.org, and Alice Steinglass, head of product and engineering who designed this year’s Minecraft and Star Wars tutorials.   This will be mostly an open-ended Q&A, whether to answer questions about how to host an Hour of Code, or just asking Hadi or Alice your own favorite computer science questions, we encourage every Hour of Code organizer to join and hear a bit about the vision for the campaign.

### Increasing Access to CS Education: What Works, What Doesn't
#### Wednesday, October 14, 2015 from 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM (CDT) 
In this interactive discussion, you’ll hear from Pat Yongpradit, VP of Education at Code.org and Heather King, program manager at Outlier, about the results of our programs over the course of the 2014-15 school year. What did teachers take away from professional development? What did students learn? What did we learn from our district partnerships? Learn from our successes and challenges as we discuss how we might work together as a CS education community to increase access to CS education for all. See [https://code.org/about/evaluation/summary](https://code.org/about/evaluation/summary) and [http://outlier.uchicago.edu/evaluation_codeorg/](http://outlier.uchicago.edu/evaluation_codeorg/) for the reports.
