**Computer Science Teacher's Association:** The [CSTA](http://csta.acm.org/index.html) is an engaged community of educators across the nation that is committed to bringing computer science education to their students while raising awareness of the subject to the general public. They host an annual conference and also have chapters that hold local meetings.

**Advocating for computer science**: We have a (small) team that focuses on advocating through state governments to bring computer science into K-12 classrooms. We have [fact sheets](/promote) telling the state of computer science in each of these states — and you can access and download your state’s information.
