# Teacher Community and Support
<img src="/images/code-group.jpg" width="100%"/>

## Teachers Matter
Code.org's vision is that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science. This is a teacher-led movement to bring opportunity to *all* schools, and to ALL students. We encourage educators to consider that their classroom, their school can embrace computer science, and to help lead the change that's sweeping the nation.

We believe anybody can learn computer science - but that our students won't reach their full potential without great teachers to guide their learning. We count on teachers to break stereotypes, to introduce more girls, more students of color, and more of our youngest learners, to this new and exciting field.

## Get Connected
We’re kicking off a new worldwide community to keep teachers up-to-date on what’s new with Code.org, and to help connect our teachers around the globe.
