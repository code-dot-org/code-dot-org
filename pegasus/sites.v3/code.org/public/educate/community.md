# Community and Support
<img src="/images/code-group.jpg" width="100%"/>

##  Why Community? 
Our vision is that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science.  We believe anybody can learn computer science, but that our students won't reach their full potential without great teachers to guide their learning. 

We count on teachers in their classrooms to break stereotypes, to introduce more girls, more students of color, and more of our youngest learners to this new and exciting field. And the connections these computer science teachers make with the wider computer science community can take the opportunities in these classrooms even farther. 


## Here’s how to get connected

You might be an educator that wants to connect locally with organizations who care about computer science. Or maybe you’re a computer science professional that wants to speak in a classroom. Parent, student, educator, partner… whatever you’re doing matters for computer science education. Here’s what we’re doing to connect you to each other! 

Join a worldwide conversation keeping teachers up-to-date (and hearing their feedback) on new resources and opportunities from Code.org.

### Recruit 

[Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com): 200,000 classrooms tried the Hour of Code in 2015. Most of these teachers don’t teach computer science. *18% told us they went on to teach computer science after trying an Hour of Code.* You can also use it to help recruit, parents, administrators. Find out more at [HourOfCode.com](https://hourofcode.com)

**Recruiting materials to use in-person**: We’ve created [one-pagers and videos](/marketingkit) for you to use to talk about our Professional Learning Programs, why computer science is important, and why we believe *every* student should have the *opportunity* to learn it. 

**The incredible Outreach Team**: We have district managers who maintain supportive relationships with our partner districts. Find out who they are, let them know what you’re up to, and work with them to build a rock star community in your district. 

### Support

So, you’ve recruited teachers who are ready to try something new. And now that they’re doing the new things, they have some feedback to share and some questions to ask. 

**Report a bug or give feedback**: In the top right-hand corner of any Code Studio course, there’s a **Report Bug** button. Click that button to report something you think might be wrong with that level. 

[Professional learning forums](https://forum.code.org): Our forums are a place for teachers to have conversations, celebrating and sharing obstacles for computer science in their classrooms. Find your program’s thread on our forums to receive support and provide help for your peers. Visit [forum.code.org](https://forum.code.org). 

### Sustain

A computer science classroom is more successful when it’s connected with a community that cares. Here are a few ways for rock star local computer science leaders to sustain a local community. 

**[@TeachCode blog](http://teacherblog.code.org) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/teachcode)**: Engage with us, and specifically the teacher community, on social media. This conversation is a huge part of sustaining successful computer science classrooms — it tells the stories of the challenges and risks teachers are taking, inspires and breaks stereotypes, and supports with new resources. On social media, you’ll find:
 
- [Teacher of the month](/totm)
<br/>
- [Student of the month](/sotm)
<br/>
- [New Code Studio resources](http://teacherblog.code.org)
<br/>
- [Highlights from classrooms and workshops worldwide](http://twitter.com/teachcode)
<br/>
- [A worldwide #CSforAll conversation](http://twitter.com/search?q=%23CSforAll&src=tyah)

**Advocating for computer science**: We have a (small) team that focuses on advocating through state governments to bring computer science into K-12 classrooms. We have [fact sheets](/promote) telling the state of computer science in each of these states — and you can access and download your state’s information. 


## Leadership Opportunities
### Become a Code.org Professional Learning Partner
Code.org Professional Learning Partners help increase the sustainability of our Computer Science programs at the local level. Code.org is partnering with organizations who can host local workshops for teachers new to computer science and build and sustain a community of computer science educators.

## Other Community Resources
Looking for other ways to get connected to computer science teachers around the world? Check out these great community programs from our partners:

- **[CS10K](http://cs10kcommunity.org):** A nationwide virtual community for CS educators, [CS10K](http://cs10kcommunity.org) offers opportunities for sharing resources, developing leadership and connecting with peers.
- **[Computer Science Teacher's Association](http://csta.acm.org/index.html):** The [CSTA](http://csta.acm.org/index.html) is an engaged community of educators across the nation that is committed to bringing computer science education to their students while raising awareness of the subject to the general public. They host an annual conference and also have chapters that hold local meetings.
