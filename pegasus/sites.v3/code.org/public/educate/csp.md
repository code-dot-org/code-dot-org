# Computer Science Principles #

## <a name="whatis"></a>What is CS Principles?

[col-50]

In fall 2016, the College Board will launch its newest AP&reg; course, AP Computer Science Principles. The course introduces students to the foundational concepts of computer science and challenges them to explore how computing and technology can impact the world. The AP Program designed AP Computer Science Principles with the goal of creating leaders in computer science fields and attracting and engaging those who are traditionally underrepresented with essential computing tools and multidisciplinary opportunities.

| Link | Unit Description |
| :------------------:|-----------|
|  [![binary magic](csp/images/thumb_binaryMagic.png "Unit 1")](/educate/csp/unit1) [Unit 1](/educate/csp/unit1) | **Digital Information:** What can be represented with a single bit and how do we get a single bit of information from one place to another? This unit explores the technical challenges and questions that arise from the need to represent digital information in computers and transfer it between people and computational devices. Topics include: the digital representation of information - numbers, text, images, and communication protocols |
|  [![Internet Simulator](csp/images/thumb_netsim.png "Unit 2")](/educate/csp/unit2) [Unit 2](/educate/csp/unit2)  | **The Internet:** Students continue to work together to invent solutions and protocols to many of the problems that arise in the structure and function of the Internet. Topics include the Internet Protocol, DNS, TCP/IP, cryptography, computationally hard problems, and other security and hacking concerns.
| [![App Lab](csp/images/thumb_applab.png "Unit 3")](/educate/csp/unit3) [Unit 3](/educate/csp/unit3) | **Programming:** Students learn the fundamentals programming constructs of JavaScript by solving problems with “turtle graphics.”  Then move on to programming simple event driven apps.  An emphasis is placed on enabling students to solve problems and write code in teams. |
| [![binary magic](csp/images/thumb_graph.png "Unit 4")](/educate/csp/unit4) [Unit 4](/educate/csp/unit4)| **Data:** Being able to digitally manipulate data, visualize it, identify patterns, trends and possible meanings are important practical skills that computer scientists do every day. The data rich world we live in also introduces many complex questions related to public policy, law, ethics and societal impact. Understanding where data comes from, having intuitions about what could be learned or extracted from it, and being able to use computational tools to manipulate data and communicate about it are the primary skills addressed in the unit.|
|[![binary magic](csp/images/thumb_app.png "Unit 5")](/educate/csp/unit5) [Unit 5](/educate/csp/unit5)| **Explore and Create:** Class time devoted to preparation and execution of the AP® Performance Tasks: Explore and Create.|
|[![binary magic](csp/images/thumb_survey.png "Post-AP")](/educate/csp/postap) [Post-AP](/educate/csp/postap)| **Databases in Apps:** This loosely-structured material includes new content which students can work through after the AP® test. The content includes skill-building levels about remote data storage and how to use App Lab's Data Tools to create data-backed apps.|

### Chat about CSP in the CSP forum
We have forums for educators to discuss and trade ideas about CSP and talk about the curriculum.  Code.org forums are used for all of our courses K-12 and can be found at [forum.code.org](http://forum.code.org).  For CSP there are two forums that are most useful:

* [General CSP forum](http://forum.code.org/c/csp)
* [Unit 1 Lesson-Specific Forums](http://forum.code.org/c/csp-unit1)
* [Unit 2 Lesson-Specific Forums](http://forum.code.org/c/csp-unit2)
* [Unit 3 Lesson-Specific Forums](http://forum.code.org/c/csp-unit3)
* [Unit 4 Lesson-Specific Forums](http://forum.code.org/c/csp-unit4)
* [Unit 5 Lesson-Specific Forums](http://forum.code.org/c/csp-unit5)
* [Post-AP Stage-Specific Forums](http://forum.code.org/c/csp-post-ap)

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### How can I access answer keys? 
Any teacher can apply for Code Studio access to protected teacher-only materials (answer keys, etc) through <strong><a href = "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1f5QPKi3F_3nBDR8q9BcXCqixzY7SCQd7Seob0-JYizU/viewform" target="_blank">this form</a></strong>.
<br>

#### How Can I communicate with other teachers who are using the curriulum? 
Check out our forum at <a href ="forum.code.org" target=_blank>http://forum.code.org</a>. There you'll find a space for general CSP discussion as well as unit- and lesson-specific threads.
<br>

#### When will lessons be published?

All lessons are now published! See the table above.

<br />

#### Can I test lessons and give feedback?

Yes, please!  As lessons are published on the website we invite anyone to try them out - both the lessons and any new tools or software - and let us know how it went.  Our desire is that the curriculum will be a living document and not something set in stone. We are open to changes or alternatives to lessons so please send us your feedback by using the CSP forum.

<br />

#### How/Where can I get professional development for this course?

In-person professional development for the Code.org CSP course will be available in select partner districts starting in Summer 2015. After one year of piloting and refining the PD program we will make all of our PD agendas, schedules, and other materials available to the public. This includes all of our online and in-person PD programs.

<br />

#### How can I learn more about the progress of the curriculum?

We're now sending out a monthly status email for members of the computer science education community who are interested in peeking under the hood as we actively work to develop the curriculum and tools for the course. [Sign up for future emails](http://code.org/educate/csp/CSPStatus_Signup).
