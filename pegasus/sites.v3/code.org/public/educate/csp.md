# Computer Science Principles #

## <a name="whatis"></a>What is CS Principles?
The College Board has proposed a new course called AP® Computer Science Principles.  This  course is designed to be far more than a traditional introduction to programming - it is a rigorous, engaging, and approachable course that explores many of the big, foundational ideas of computing so that all students understand how these concepts are transforming the world we live in. The official AP® exam is set to go live in the 2016-17 school year with an exam and performance-based assessments.

## Code.org's CS Principles Curriculum
Code.org is creating a complete curriculum consisting of daily lesson plans, videos, tutorials, tools, and assessments that covers the learning objectives from the [CS Principles Curriculum Framework](http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/comp-sci-principles-draft-cf-final.pdf). Check back often as batches of lessons will be released on a rolling basis from now until Summer 2015 when the entire curriculum will be publicly available. The resources will be distributed under a [Creative Commons License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/).

| Link| Unit Description |
| :------------------:|-----------|
|  [![binary magic](csp/images/thumb_binaryMagic.png "Unit 1")](/educate/csp/unit1) [Unit 1](/educate/csp/unit1) | **Sending Bits and Encoding Information** What can be represented with a single bit and how do we get a single bit of information from one place to another? This unit explores the technical challenges and questions that arise from the need to represent digital information in computers and transfer it between people and computational devices. Topics include: the digital representation of information - numbers, text, images, and communication protocols | 
|*Coming Soon*| **Algorithms and Networking** Build students' problem solving skills through unplugged and computer-based problems. Students are asked to express algorithmic solutions with increasing formality of language to analyze algorithms. Topics include: encryption, security, computationally hard problems, and internet protocols|
|*Coming Soon*| **Programming** Introduces a formal programming language, JavaScript. The programming sequence enables students to write simple programs to be executed in web pages. |
|*Coming Soon*| **Data** Students will develop an understanding of the nature and structure of data that enables them to ask and answer questions about the data effectively.|
|*Coming Soon*| **Innovation** Synthesizes the topics covered in the previous units and leads students through a the practice of researching and understanding the technology behind some modern innovations.|
|*Coming Soon*| **Web Apps** Create web applications in an open-ended integrated development environment (IDE) that supports both text and visual programming. Students will learn about the structure of modern web applications and build a few small examples of certain types of applications.|

## Frequently Asked Questions

<br />
	
#### When will lessons be published?

Code.org’s CS Principles curriculum will be released publicly on a rolling basis during the 2014-15 school year as lessons are tested in classrooms and supporting materials refined. Check back often as batches of lessons will be released on a rolling basis from now until Summer 2015 when the entire curriculum will be publicly available.  They will still be considered “drafts” at that point, but they will at least have gone through one iteration of testing/revision with real teachers in real classrooms.  

<br />

#### Can I test lessons and give feedback?

Yes, please!  As lessons are published on the website we invite anyone to try them out - both the lessons and any new tools or software - and let us know how it went.  Our desire is that the curriculum will be a living document and not something set in stone. We are open to changes or alternatives to lessons so please send us your feedback by providing comments in the documents themselves.

<br />

#### How/Where can I get professional development for this course?

In-person professional development for the Code.org CSP course will be available in select partner districts starting in summer 2015. After one year of piloting and refining the PD program we will make all of our PD agendas, schedules, and other materials available to the public. This includes all of our online and in-person PD programs.
