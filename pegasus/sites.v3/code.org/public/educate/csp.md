# Computer Science Principles #

## <a name="whatis"></a>What is CS Principles?
In fall 2016, the College Board will launch its newest AP® course, AP Computer Science Principles. The course introduces students to the foundational concepts of computer science and challenges them to explore how computing and technology can impact the world. The AP Program designed AP Computer Science Principles with the goal of creating leaders in computer science fields and attracting and engaging those who are traditionally underrepresented with essential computing tools and multidisciplinary opportunities.

### Chat about CSP in the CSP forum
We have forums for educators to discuss and trade ideas about CSP and talk about the curriculum.  Code.org forums are used for all of our courses K-12 and can be found at [forum.code.org](http://forum.code.org).  For CSP there are two forums that are most useful:

* [General CSP forum](http://forum.code.org/c/csp)
* [Lesson-Specific Forums](http://forum.code.org/c/csp-feedback)

| Link | Unit Description |
| :------------------:|-----------|
|  [![binary magic](csp/images/thumb_binaryMagic.png "Unit 1")](/educate/csp/unit1) [Unit 1](/educate/csp/unit1) | **Digital Information** What can be represented with a single bit and how do we get a single bit of information from one place to another? This unit explores the technical challenges and questions that arise from the need to represent digital information in computers and transfer it between people and computational devices. Topics include: the digital representation of information - numbers, text, images, and communication protocols |
|  [![Internet Simulator](csp/images/thumb_netsim.png "Unit 2")](/educate/csp/unit2) [Unit 2](/educate/csp/unit2)  | **The Internet** Students continue to work together to invent solutions and protocols to many of the problems that arise in the structure and function of the Internet. Topics include the Internet Protocol, DNS, TCP/IP, cryptography, computationally hard problems, and other security and hacking concerns.
|*Coming Soon*| **Programming** Students learn the fundamentals programming constructs of JavaScript by solving problems with “turtle graphics.”  Then move on to programming simple event driven apps.  An emphasis is placed on enabling students to solve problems and write code in teams. |
|*Coming Soon*| **Data** Students continue programming and building web apps, now with a view towards data: processing it with algorithms, and the implications of storing data collected from and by others on the web.  Students explore “big data” by making queries against a data analysis api.|
|*Coming Soon*| **Explore and Create** Class time devoted to preparation and execution of the AP® Performance Tasks: Explore and Create.|

## Frequently Asked Questions
<br />

#### When will lessons be published?

**Summer 2015**

Unit completion is driven primarily by our professional development schedule. Units 1 and 2 are complete for professional development sessions this summer.  Units 3 and 4 are undergoing revisions for delivery in the fall for ongoing professional development sessions.

**Target Dates for publishing unit drafts online**

As the units undergo revisions we hope to publish them on an ongoing basis leading up to and through the beginning of the school year. These are our targets.

* Unit 1 - Target July 1 - **done!** see [Unit 1](/educate/csp/unit1)
* Unit 2 - Target Aug. 31 - **done!** see [Unit 2](/educate/csp/unit2)
* Unit 3 - Target Early Fall (Sept/Oct)
* Unit 4 - Target Mid Fall (Oct/Nov)

<br />

#### Can I test lessons and give feedback?

Yes, please!  As lessons are published on the website we invite anyone to try them out - both the lessons and any new tools or software - and let us know how it went.  Our desire is that the curriculum will be a living document and not something set in stone. We are open to changes or alternatives to lessons so please send us your feedback by using the CSP forum.

<br />

#### How/Where can I get professional development for this course?

In-person professional development for the Code.org CSP course will be available in select partner districts starting in Summer 2015. After one year of piloting and refining the PD program we will make all of our PD agendas, schedules, and other materials available to the public. This includes all of our online and in-person PD programs.

<br />

#### How can I learn more about the progress of the curriculum?

We're now sending out a monthly status email for members of the computer science education community who are interested in peeking under the hood as we actively work to develop the curriculum and tools for the course. [Sign up for future emails](http://code.org/educate/csp/CSPStatus_Signup).
