# Computer Science Principles #


## <a name="whatis"></a>What is CS Principles?

[col-50]

In fall 2016, the College Board launched its newest AP&reg; course, AP Computer Science Principles. The course introduces students to the foundational concepts of computer science and challenges them to explore how computing and technology can impact the world. The AP Program designed AP Computer Science Principles with the goal of creating leaders in computer science fields and attracting and engaging those who are traditionally underrepresented with essential computing tools and multidisciplinary opportunities.

## <a name="lessons"></a>Lessons

*After the '15-'16 pilot year, we revised and reorganized major portions of the curriculum. All of the '15-'16 units are still available to use from the [2015-2016 version of the course](/educate/csp/archive/summary).*

All lessons are available at [curriculum.code.org/csp](https://curriculum.code.org/csp)

| Link | Unit Description |
| :------------------:|-----------|
|  [![Internet Simulator](csp/images/thumb_netsim.png "Unit 1")](https://curriculum.code.org/csp/unit1) [Unit 1](https://curriculum.code.org/csp/unit1)  | **The Internet (Last updated: May 2016)** This unit begins exploring the technical challenges and questions that arise from the need to represent digital information in computers and transfer it between people and computational devices. In the second half of the unit, students solve problems similar ones that had to be solved to build the real Internet. Students design their own versions of protocols, each one layered on the previous one, in a process that mimics the layered sets of protocols on the real Internet. Topics include: the digital representation of numbers and text, Internet Protocol, DNS, and TCP/IP. |
|   [![binary magic](csp/images/thumb_binaryMagic.png "Unit 2")](https://curriculum.code.org/csp/unit2) [Unit 2](https://curriculum.code.org/csp/unit2)   | **Digital Information (Last updated: May 2016)** This unit further explores the ways that digital information is encoded, represented and manipulated. In this unit students will look at and generate data, clean it, manipulate it, and create and use visualizations to identify patterns and trends.|
|  [![App Lab](csp/images/thumb_applab.png "Unit 3")](https://curriculum.code.org/csp/unit3) [Unit 3](https://curriculum.code.org/csp/unit3) | **Algorithms and Programming (Last updated: June 2016)** This unit introduces students to programming in the JavaScript language and creating small applications (apps) that live on the web. This introduction places a heavy emphasis on understanding general principles of computer programming and revealing those things that are universally applicable to any programming language.|
|  [![Graph](csp/images/thumb_graph.png "Unit 4")](https://curriculum.code.org/csp/unit4) [Unit 4](https://curriculum.code.org/csp/unit4)| **Big Data and Privacy (Last updated: October 2016)** The data rich world we live in also introduces many complex questions related to public policy, law, ethics and societal impact. In many ways this unit acts as a unit on current events. It is highly likely that there will be something related to big data, privacy and security going on in the news at any point in time. The major goals of the unit are 1) for students to develop a well ­rounded and balanced view about data in the world around them and both the positive and negative effects of it and 2) to understand the basics of how and why modern encryption works.|
| [![App](csp/images/thumb_app.png "Unit 5")](https://curriculum.code.org/csp/unit5) [Unit 5](https://curriculum.code.org/csp/unit5)| **Building Apps (Last updated: December 2016)** This unit continues to develop students’ ability to program in the JavaScript language, using Code.org’s App Lab environment to create a series of small applications (apps) that live on the web, each highlighting a core concept of programming. In this unit students transition to creating event­-driven apps. The unit assumes that students have learned the concepts and skills from Unit 3, namely: writing and using functions, using simple repeat loops, being able to read documentation, collaborating, and using the Code Studio environment with App Lab. |
|  [![survey](csp/images/thumb_survey.png "Unit 6")](https://curriculum.code.org/csp/unit6) [PTs](https://curriculum.code.org/csp/unit6) | **Create and Explore PT (Last updated: January 2017)** Class time devoted to preparation and execution of the AP® Performance Tasks: Explore and Create. |
|||
|  [![data button](csp/images/data_button.png "Unit 6")](https://curriculum.code.org/csp/unit6) [post-AP](https://studio.code.org/s/csppostap) | **Post-AP material - Making Data-backed Apps** After the AP test, many people have a few weeks left of school. We have some material and lessons that teach students how to use App Lab's database capabilities to make apps that store data in the cloud so it can be retrieved later. |

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### <a name="materials"></a>What materials do I need for this course?
**Required Materials:**

This course requires students have access to computers with a modern web browser. For more details, check out Code.org's technology requirements, [here](/educate/it). 

Many lessons have handouts that are designed to guide students through activities. While these handouts are not required, we highly recommend their use. In addition to handouts, you will need the following: 

- Unit 1 Lesson 2 requires some craft materials for constructing physical devices. The lesson recommends items like cups, string/yarn, construction paper, flashlights, slinkies, noise makers, markers, and glue. 

**Optional Materials**

The following items are called for in lessons, but alternatives are offered below:

- (Unit 3, Lesson 1) A handful of legos per 2-3 students. Alternatives: post-it notes, construction paper
- (Unit 3, Lesson 2 - 3) Playing cards (1 deck per 6 students). Alternatives: write numbers of post-it notes. 
- (Unit 4, Lesson 8) Clear dixie cups with beans. Alternatives: Any clear container (ziplock bag, empty water bottle, etc) with any small item (beads, raisins, coffee beans, etc) 

The following supplies are completely optional but will be useful to have on hand for various lessons:

- Graph paper
- Chart paper 
- Markers
- Post-it notes

#### How can I access answer keys? 
Any teacher can apply for Code Studio access to protected teacher-only materials (answer keys, etc) through <strong><a href = "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1f5QPKi3F_3nBDR8q9BcXCqixzY7SCQd7Seob0-JYizU/viewform" target="_blank">this form</a></strong>.

<br />

#### How can I communicate with other teachers who are using the curriculum? 
Check out our forum at <a href ="forum.code.org" target=_blank>http://forum.code.org</a>. There you'll find a space for general CS Principles discussion as well as unit- and lesson-specific threads.

<br />

#### Where did all the lessons go?
For the '16-'17 school year, we are revising the '15-'16 version of the curriculum (see a summary of the changes [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/export?format=pdf&id=1ElvZenQSCigqBXKEHnXYRruck7umCJd699aippGCfLQ)) We will re-release each unit as soon as it is ready. You can still access all of the ['15-'16 archived materials](/educate/csp/archive/summary). 

<br />
#### Can I give feedback on the lessons?

Yes, please! Our desire is that the curriculum will be a living document and not something set in stone. We are open to changes or alternatives to lessons so please send us your feedback by using the CS Principles forum.

<br />

#### How/Where can I get professional development for this course?

In-person professional development for the Code.org CS Principles course will be available in select partner districts starting in Summer 2015. After one year of piloting and refining the PD program we will make all of our PD agendas, schedules, and other materials available to the public. This includes all of our online and in-person PD programs.

<br />

#### How can I learn about what's new or changing with the curriculum?

We send out monthly updates! [Sign up for future emails](http://code.org/educate/csp/CSPStatus_Signup).
