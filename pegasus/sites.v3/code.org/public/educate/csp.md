# Computer Science Principles

## <a name="whatis"></a>What is CS Principles?

[col-50]

In fall 2016, the College Board launched its newest AP&reg; course, AP Computer Science Principles. The course introduces students to the foundational concepts of computer science and challenges them to explore how computing and technology can impact the world. The AP Program designed AP Computer Science Principles with the goal of creating leaders in computer science fields and attracting and engaging those who are traditionally underrepresented with essential computing tools and multidisciplinary opportunities.

## <a name="lessons"></a>Unit Overview


| Link | Unit Description |
| :------------------:|-----------|
|  [![Internet Simulator](csp/images/thumb_netsim.png "Unit 1")](https://curriculum.code.org/csp/unit1) [Unit 1](https://curriculum.code.org/csp/unit1)  | **The Internet** What can be represented with a single bit and how do we get a single bit of information from one place to another? This unit explores the technical challenges and questions that arise from the need to represent digital information in computers and transfer it between people and computational devices. Topics include: the digital representation of information - numbers, text, images, and communication protocols.|
|   [![binary magic](csp/images/thumb_binaryMagic.png "Unit 2")](https://curriculum.code.org/csp/unit2) [Unit 2](https://curriculum.code.org/csp/unit2)   | **Digital Information** This unit further explores the ways that digital information is encoded, represented and manipulated. In this unit students will look at and generate data, clean it, manipulate it, and create and use visualizations to identify patterns and trends.|
|  [![App Lab](csp/images/thumb_applab.png "Unit 3")](https://curriculum.code.org/csp/unit3) [Unit 3](https://curriculum.code.org/csp/unit3) | **Algorithms and Programming** This unit introduces the foundational concepts of computer programming, which unlocks the ability to make rich, interactive apps. This course uses JavaScript as the programming language, and App Lab as the programming environment to build apps, but the concepts learned in these lessons span all programming languages and tools.|
|  [![Graph](csp/images/thumb_graph.png "Unit 4")](https://curriculum.code.org/csp/unit4) [Unit 4](https://curriculum.code.org/csp/unit4)| **Big Data and Privacy** The data rich world we live in also introduces many complex questions related to public policy, law, ethics and societal impact. In many ways this unit acts as a unit on current events. It is highly likely that there will be something related to big data, privacy and security going on in the news at any point in time. The major goals of the unit are 1) for students to develop a well-rounded and balanced view about data in the world around them and both the positive and negative effects of it and 2) to understand the basics of how and why modern encryption works.|
| [![App](csp/images/thumb_app.png "Unit 5")](https://curriculum.code.org/csp/unit5) [Unit 5](https://curriculum.code.org/csp/unit5)| **Building Apps** This unit continues to develop students’ ability to program in the JavaScript language, using Code.org’s App Lab environment to create a series of small applications (apps) that live on the web, each highlighting a core concept of programming. In this unit students transition to creating event-driven apps. The unit assumes that students have learned the concepts and skills from Unit 3, namely: writing and using functions, using simple repeat loops, being able to read documentation, collaborating, and using the Code Studio environment with App Lab.|
|  [![survey](csp/images/thumb_survey.png "AP Performance Tasks")](https://curriculum.code.org/csp/csp-ap) [AP Tasks](https://curriculum.code.org/csp/csp-ap) | **AP Exam and Performance Tasks** Class time and lessons devoted to preparation and execution of the AP® Performance Tasks: Explore and Create.|
|||
|  [![data button](csp/images/data_button.png "Post AP")](https://studio.code.org/s/csppostap) [post-AP](https://studio.code.org/s/csppostap) | **Post-AP material - Making Data-backed Apps** After the AP test, many people have a few weeks left of school. We have some material and lessons that teach students how to use App Lab's database capabilities to make apps that store data in the cloud so it can be retrieved later. |

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### <a name="materials"></a>What materials do I need for this course?
**Required Materials:**

This course requires students have access to computers with a modern web browser. For more details, check out Code.org's technology requirements, [here](/educate/it). 

Many lessons have handouts that are designed to guide students through activities. While these handouts are not required, we highly recommend their use. In addition to handouts, you will need the following: 

- Unit 1 Lesson 2 requires some craft materials for constructing physical devices. The lesson recommends items like cups, string/yarn, construction paper, flashlights, slinkies, noise makers, markers, and glue. 

**Optional Materials**

The following items are called for in lessons, but alternatives are offered below:

- (Unit 3, Lesson 1) A handful of legos per 2-3 students. Alternatives: post-it notes, construction paper
- (Unit 3, Lesson 2 - 3) Playing cards (1 deck per 6 students). Alternatives: write numbers of post-it notes. 
- (Unit 4, Lesson 8) Clear dixie cups with beans. Alternatives: Any clear container (ziplock bag, empty water bottle, etc) with any small item (beads, raisins, coffee beans, etc) 

The following supplies are completely optional but will be useful to have on hand for various lessons:

- Graph paper
- Chart paper 
- Markers
- Post-it notes

#### How can I access answer keys? 
With an approved teacher account you can find answer keys in a blue "Teacher Only" panel that shows in the online lessons and activities.

For teachers in our professional learning program will automatically be approved to view answer keys.  If you need an approved teacher account, any teacher can apply for Code Studio access to protected teacher-only materials (answer keys, etc) through <strong><a href = "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1f5QPKi3F_3nBDR8q9BcXCqixzY7SCQd7Seob0-JYizU/viewform" target="_blank">this form</a></strong>.

<br />

#### How can I communicate with other teachers who are using the curriculum? 
Check out our forum at <a href ="forum.code.org" target=_blank>http://forum.code.org</a>. There you'll find a space for general CS Principles discussion as well as unit- and lesson-specific threads.


<br />
#### Can I give feedback on the lessons?

Yes, please! Our desire is that the curriculum will be a living document and not something set in stone. We are open to changes or alternatives to lessons so please send us your feedback by using the CS Principles forum.

<br />

#### How/Where can I get professional development for this course?
We have an in-person professional learning program...
