# Computer Science Principles

## <a name="whatis"></a>What is CS Principles?

Computer Science Principles introduces students to the foundational concepts of computer science and challenges them to explore how computing and technology can impact the world. More than a traditional introduction to programming, it is a rigorous, engaging, and approachable course that explores many of the foundational ideas of computing so all students understand how these concepts are transforming the world we live in.

<br>
This year-long course can be taught as an AP or non-AP course - no prerequisites required for students or for teachers new to computer science! In addition, our curriculum is available at no cost for anyone, anywhere to teach. For more information about our goals and approach to our courses, please see our [curriculum values](/educate/curriculum/values) and our [professional learning values](/educate/professional-learning/values).

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### <a name="materials"></a>What materials do I need for this course?
**Required Materials:**

This course requires students have access to computers with a modern web browser. For more details, check out Code.org's technology requirements, [here](/educate/it).

Many lessons have handouts that are designed to guide students through activities. While these handouts are not required, we highly recommend their use. In addition to handouts, you will need the following:

- Unit 1 Lesson 2 requires some craft materials for constructing physical devices. The lesson recommends items like cups, string/yarn, construction paper, flashlights, slinkies, noise makers, markers, and glue.

**Optional Materials**

The following items are called for in lessons, but alternatives are offered below:

- (Unit 3, Lesson 1) A handful of legos per 2-3 students. Alternatives: post-it notes, construction paper
- (Unit 3, Lesson 2 - 3) Playing cards (1 deck per 6 students). Alternatives: write numbers of post-it notes.
- (Unit 4, Lesson 8) Clear dixie cups with beans. Alternatives: Any clear container (ziplock bag, empty water bottle, etc) with any small item (beads, raisins, coffee beans, etc)

The following supplies are completely optional but will be useful to have on hand for various lessons:

- Graph paper
- Chart paper
- Markers
- Post-it notes

#### How can I access answer keys?
With an approved teacher account you can find answer keys in a blue "Teacher Only" panel that shows in the online lessons and activities.

Teachers in our professional learning program will automatically be approved to view answer keys.  If you need an approved teacher account, any teacher can apply for Code Studio access to protected teacher-only materials (answer keys, etc) through <strong><a href = "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1f5QPKi3F_3nBDR8q9BcXCqixzY7SCQd7Seob0-JYizU/viewform" target="_blank">this form</a></strong>.

<br />

#### How can I communicate with other teachers who are using the curriculum?
Check out our forum at <a href ="forum.code.org" target=_blank>http://forum.code.org</a>. There you'll find a space for general CS Principles discussion as well as unit- and lesson-specific threads.

<br />
#### Can I give feedback on the lessons?

Yes, please! Our desire is that the curriculum will be a living document and not something set in stone. We are open to changes or alternatives to lessons so please send us your feedback by using the CS Principles forum.

<br />

#### How/Where can I get professional development for this course?
We have an in-person professional learning program...
[click here](/educate/professional-learning/cs-principles) to learn more!

<br />

#### How can I learn about what's new or changing with the curriculum?

We send out monthly updates! [Sign up for future emails](http://code.org/educate/csp/CSPStatus_Signup).
