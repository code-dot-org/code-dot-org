# Our newest course: CS Explorations #

## <a name="what"></a>What is CS Explorations?
CS Explorations is our newest curriculum-in-development - an introductory Computer Science course that empowers students to create authentic artifacts and engage with CS as a medium for creativity, communication, problem solving, and fun.

### <a name="pathway"></a>Completing a K-12 pathway
Our new course, CS Explorations, is being designed to fit naturally between our CS Fundamentals course for K-5 and our CS Principles course for AP/Honors high school students. This allows us to offer districts, teachers and students a complete and cohesive pathway of courses that build on each other and flow naturally together. 

### <a name="tools"></a>Powerful tools with a high ceiling
CS Explorations aims to introduce students to tools and programming languages that are accessible for beginners, but which offer plenty of room to grow and create sophisticated authentic projects. Using our App Lab programming environment students will be able to transition from blocks to typed code at their own pace while learning JavaScript. New improvements to this tool will enable students to build simple animations, stories, or games as well as apps. Students will also develop Maker skills through the study of physical computing on the Arduino platform, at a _very_ accessible price.

### <a name="flexible"></a>Designed for flexibility
CS Explorations will be designed primarily for grades 7-9, so it can be taught effectively in middle school or high school. The two semesters spiral upon each other, allowing the course to be  taught as a single semester, two sequential semesters, a full-year course, or even integrated into existing middle school tech-ed classes.

### <a name="content"></a>A wide lense on CS
Computer Science encompases far more than just coding, and CS Explorations will provide students opportunity to explore the many facets of CS, including:

- Human Computer Interaction: The myriad ways in which people interface with the computing objects in their lives.
- Computational Thinkging and Problem Solving: Learning to think like a Computer Scientist and use computers to solve problems.
- The Social Web: Understanding the internet, its impact on society, and how to use the web as a publishing platform.
- Animations and Interactions: Programming computers to create art, animations, stories, and interactive games.
- Physical Computing: Building computing devices that interact with the physical world in novel and exciting ways.
- Making Sense of Data: Harnessing, processing, and building understanding from the mountains of data all around us.
- Mobile App Development: Creating, testing, and refining authentic mobile apps that serve a real audience.


## <a name="why"></a>Why the name CS Explorations?

This course is independently authored, yet deeply inspired by the underlying philosophy, core concepts, and exploratory nature of Exploring Computer Science (ECS). It is designed based on our years of experience with ECS (as classroom teachers, professional development facilitators, and district partnership managers). The course will offer teachers the same fantastic aspects we love about ECS, while addressing our most common feedback, and introducing students more advanced programming and physical computing platforms. Calling it “CS Explorations” pays homage to our inspiration - it is important to us to be clear from the very title that the underlying philosophy for this course was inspired by ECS. We’ll likely include a paragraph somewhere in the curriculum that looks much like this paragraph, to be very clear about our inspiration.

It is also important for our schools and teachers and students to know that we designed this course as a natural successor to the ECS v5 curriculum that we distribute to them today. Our naming simultaneous clarifies that this course is inspired by the same ECS material, and also designed to fit between our <a href="/educate/k5">CS Fundamentals</a> and <a href="/educate/csp">CS Principles</a> courses. It is clearly related in concept to Exploring CS, yet clearly different, and independently authored.  Nobody would be confused into thinking they're the same course, or made by the same organization. Yet it's clear that they're inspired by the same great philosophy around inquiry and equity.


## Frequently Asked Questions

#### What is the timeline for CSE?

For the 2016-17 school year we'll continue the professional development support we do for ECS version 5.  We will pilot the new course materials during the spring of 2016-17 with schools that are eager to try new materials. 

For 2017-18 and beyond, we'll continue supporting ECS in our existing schools while rolling out the new CS Explorations course to new schools.

<br />

#### Can I keep teaching ECS?

Of course! If schools prefer to continue using the version 5 of ECS, we’ll continue distributing it to them. If you want to use the latest revisions of ECS, you can download it on your own from <a href="http://www.exploringcs.org">exploringcs.org</a>

<br />

#### I was trained on ECS, can I transition to CSE?

For existing ECS teachers who want to try the new curriculum, we’ll offer a short transitional PD to help familiarize them to the new content. The core pedagogy surrounding equity and inquiry as well as high level conceptual material should be relatively unchanged. You're also welcome to integrate parts of CSE into your current ECS course at your own pace and as you see fit.

<br />

#### Why are you creating this instead of continuing to offer ECS?

ECS is a wonderful introductory computing course, and we at Code.org continue to support it and the hundreds of teachers currently teaching the course in our partner districts. Feedback from teachers and evaluation of our scaling shows us many reasons to make a new course:

- We're making a curriculum pathway from K through 12. To date, we’ve offered districts, teachers and students various entry points into computer science that weren’t deliberately designed as a pathway for students from Kindergarten through graduation. The new curriculum will complete our K-12 pathway, building on experiences from our elementary CS Fundamentals course and preparing students for CS Principles, while providing appropriate supports for students without prior CS experience.  
- The LEGO Mindstorms platform is too expensive for many schools. Most schools in our partner districts choose not to buy it, so most of our ECS teachers can’t teach the robotics unit. Transitioning to physical computing and the more affordable Arduino platform enables more schools to teach CS with real hardware while empowering students to create physical devices that feel more real and applicable to the real world than LEGO robotic rovers.
- Many of our teachers want more programming, and their students want to explore beyond the drag and drop environment of Scratch, forcing teachers to hunt for curriculum alternatives. With millions of kids learning drag and drop programming in K-5, students area ready for programming in a traditional programming language much sooner.
- Our middle schools want curriculum that teaches students concepts covered by ECS, but ECS isn't designed to be adapted for middle school.
- We've collected a lot of evidence-based research and evaluation on how to better support our ECS teachers, to improve equity and access. A brief summary of teacher feedback is <a href="https://code.org/about/evaluation/pd#ecs">here</a>.

<br />

#### Can I pilot the new course?

We will be formally piloting the course with select groups in the Spring of the 16/17 school year - if you are interested in participating in this pilot please complete the application form here.

As lessons are completed we will also be publishing them on the website we invite anyone to try them out - both the lessons and any new tools or software - and let us know how it went.  Our desire is that the curriculum will be a living document and not something set in stone. We are open to changes or alternatives to lessons so please send us your feedback by using the forum.

<br />

#### How/Where can I get professional development for this course?

In-person professional development for the Code.org CSE course will be available for partner districts starting in Summer 2017.

<br />

#### How can I learn more about the progress of the curriculum?

We will be sending out regular status emails for members of the computer science education community who are interested in peeking under the hood as we actively work to develop the curriculum and tools for the course. [Sign up for future emails](http://code.org/educate/cse/CSEStatus_Signup).
