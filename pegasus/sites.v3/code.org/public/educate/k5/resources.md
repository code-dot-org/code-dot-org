# Sample Email to recruit teachers

**Subject Line:** Bring computer science to your classroom!

<br />

I recently attended a [Code.org](https://code.org) workshop to learn how to teach basic computer science to elementary students. The workshop was excellent. The majority of Code.org workshop attendees rank it the best PD they've ever attended!

**I encourage you to [sign up](http://code.org/professional-development-workshops) to attend the next session in [YOUR CITY]**

Regardless of what subject you teach, incorporating computer science into your classroom will give your students a huge leg up. Besides, this is a subject the kids love learning.

**What’s in a workshop?**<br />
In-person instruction from an experienced computer science facilitator, including an intro to computer science, pedagogy, overview of the online curriculum, teacher dashboard, and strategies for teaching “unplugged” classroom activities. 

**All costs are covered by Code.org**<br />
You’ll also receive (at no cost to you):

+ Printed curriculum guide
+ Certificate of completion (which could count for PD credit)
+ Classroom supplies for the unplugged lessons
+ Fun Code.org swag

Give it a shot, and join me in teaching foundational computer science skills to our youngest learners!
