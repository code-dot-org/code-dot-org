# Apply to Pilot CS Discoveries #

## <a name="overview"></a>Overview
CS Discoveries is our newest curriculum-in-development - an introductory Computer Science course that empowers students to create authentic artifacts and engage with CS as a medium for creativity, communication, problem solving, and fun. It is targeted for grades 7-8, but able to be adapted for 6th and 9th grade. [Learn more](/educate/csd)

The course officially launches with our partner districts in Summer 2017. We are looking for a small and dedicated group of teachers who are interested in working with us for a one-semester pilot in the Spring of 2017 to provide timely feedback and input into parts of the curriculum.

If we aren't able to accept you into the official pilot group, but you would still like to be an early adopter of the curriculum, consider [signing up](/educate/csd/status_signup) for our monthly updates to learn when the tools and lessons are first available.

_Before applying:_ Please read the full [Term Sheet](/educate/csd/pilot/terms) before applying to understand the full committment we're asking of pilot teachers. Also note that teachers in Code.org partner districts will be given priority for acceptance.
