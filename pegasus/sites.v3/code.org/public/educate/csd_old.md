# Our newest course: CS Discoveries #

## <a name="what"></a>What is CS Discoveries?
CS Discoveries is our newest curriculum-in-development - an introductory Computer Science course that empowers students to create authentic artifacts and engage with CS as a medium for creativity, communication, problem solving, and fun.

### <a name="equity"></a>A CS course for everyone, designed with equity in mind
CS Discoveries is designed from the ground up to be an accessible and engaging course for all students, regardless of background or prior experience. By providing students opportunities to engage with culturally and personally relevant topics in a wide variety of CS related fields we hope to show all students that CS can be for them.

### <a name="maker"></a>Made for Makers
We know that students engage differently with real world physical objects than with virtual software, and that the process of making physical artifacts is a powerful tool for fun, engaging, and lasting learning experiences. CS Discoveries has the Maker ethos embedded throughout, providing students the opportunity to see and participate in the physical act of creation alongside the more abstract elements of computer science.

### <a name="pathway"></a>Completing a K-12 pathway
Our new course, CS Discoveries, is being designed to fit naturally between our [CS Fundamentals](/k5) course for K-5 and our [CS Principles](/csp) course for AP/Honors high school students. This allows us to offer districts, teachers and students a complete pathway of courses that build on each other and flow naturally together. 

### <a name="tools"></a>Powerful tools with a high ceiling
CS Discoveries aims to introduce students to tools and programming languages that are accessible for beginners, but which offer plenty of room to grow and create sophisticated projects. Using our App Lab programming environment, students will be able to transition from blocks to typed code at their own pace while learning JavaScript. New improvements to this tool will enable students to build simple animations, stories, or games as well as apps. Students will also develop Maker skills through the study of physical computing on the Arduino platform  at a very accessible cost. 

### <a name="flexible"></a>Designed for flexible implementation options
CS Discoveries will be designed primarily for students in grades 6-9, so it can be used in middle school or high school. The two semesters spiral upon each other, allowing the course to be taught as a single semester, two sequential semesters, a full-year course, or even integrated into existing technology classes.

### <a name="content"></a>A wide lens on Computer Science
Computer Science encompases far more than just coding, and CS Discoveries will provide students with opportunities to explore the many facets of CS, including:

- **Human Computer Interaction:** The myriad ways in which people interface with the computing objects in their lives.
- **Computational Thinking and Problem Solving:** Learning to think like a Computer Scientist and use computers to solve problems.
- **The Social Web:** Understanding the internet, its impact on society, and how to use the web as a publishing platform.
- **Animations and Interactions:** Programming computers to create art, animations, stories, and interactive games.
- **Physical Computing:** Building computing devices that interact with and sense the physical world in novel and exciting ways.
- **Making Sense of Data:** Harnessing, processing, and building understanding from the mountains of data all around us.
- **Mobile App Development:** Designing, creating, and iterating on  mobile apps that solve a real problem.

## <a name="faq"></a>Frequently Asked Questions

### <a name="relationship"></a>What is the relationship between CS Discoveries and Exploring Computer Science?

This course is deeply inspired by the philosophy of Exploring CS, based on our years of experience teaching ECS, scaling it to hundreds of classrooms nationwide, and evaluation of feedback from the teachers. This course teaches the same core concepts as ECS, along with the same _**inquiry-based philosophy**_ and the same _**teacher-learner-observer PD model**_. It also shares the same emphasis on _**equity**_ which has pervaded Code.org's curriculum in other grade levels. Because of a shared philosophy and similar learning sequence, we believe and expect that CS Discoveries can be a natural successor to ECS for schools or teachers who love the ECS philosophy while looking to gain some of the benefits mentioned below.

### <a name="transition"></a>Why is Code.org transitioning to a new course from ECS?

ECS is a great, well-established introductory computing course. We've helped hundreds of teachers introduce it in their classrooms, and we continue to support it and the hundreds of teachers currently teaching the course in our partner districts. We've also collected feedback from teachers and evaluation of our programs. Below are our reasons to make a new course:

- We're making a curriculum pathway from K through 12. To date, we’ve offered districts, teachers and students various entry points into computer science that weren’t specifically *designed* as a pathway for students from Kindergarten through graduation. This new course will complete our K-12 pathway, building on experiences from our elementary [CS Fundamentals](/educate/k5) course and preparing students for [CS Principles](/educate/csp), while providing appropriate support for students without prior CS experience.  
- The cost of the LEGO Mindstorms platform inhibits many teachers and schools from teaching the ECS robotics unit. We want to offer a physical computing unit that is affordable to all schools, to advance our goals of *equity* and access.
- With millions of students learning drag-and-drop block based programming in grades K-5, many are entering middle and high school ready to transition into a full text-based language. We want to support these students while simultaneously keeping the benefits of drag-and-drop. This is uniquely possible within our [App Lab](/applab) programming environment, which allows students to switch back and forth seamlessly between blocks and text, allowing a classroom to work in different modalities while using the same tool and the same curriculum.
- Our middle schools are requesting introductory computer science curriculum similar in scope to ECS, but designed for grades 7 - 8. ECS is designed as a high school course, and although some groups have adapted it to use in middle school, we want to create a course that is designed intentionally with this grade band in mind.


### <a name="timeline"></a>What is the timeline for CS Discoveries?

For the 2016-17 school year we'll continue the professional development support we do for ECS across all of our partner districts.  We will pilot the new course materials during the spring of 2016-17 with schools that are eager to try new materials. 

For 2017-18 and beyond, we'll continue supporting ECS in our existing schools while rolling out the new CS Discoveries course to new schools.

### <a name="teach-ecs"></a>Can I keep teaching ECS?

Of course! If schools prefer to continue using the ECS v5 curriculum, we will continue distributing it to them. If they want to use the latest version of ECS, they may also choose to ask the ECS team for it.

### I was trained on ECS, can I transition to CS Discoveries?

For existing ECS teachers who want to try the new curriculum, we’ll also offer a short transitional PD to help familiarize them to the new content. The core pedagogy surrounding equity and inquiry as well as the high level conceptual material should be very familiar to ECS teachers. You will also be welcome to integrate parts of CS Discoveries into your current ECS course at your own pace and as you see fit.


### <a name="name"></a>Why the name CS Discoveries?

This course is independently authored, yet deeply inspired by the underlying philosophy, core concepts, and exploratory nature of ECS. This course should feel familiar to those who have taught ECS, but better aligned to our cohesive K-12 pathway integrating the pedagogy, teacher supports, and tools for which Code.org has become known. We initially chose the name “CS Explorations” to pay homage to ECS, because it was important to us to be clear where our inspiration has come from.

Due to feedback that "CS Explorations" would create confusion among educators, we are using the name "CS Discoveries", which suggests the exploratory nature of a survey course, and fits  between our [CS Fundamentals](/k5) and [CS Principles](/csp) courses as part of a full K-12 pathway, while avoiding any confusion with ECS.  We will still clarify upfront in the curriculum that this work is inspired by ECS, without reflecting that inspiration in the title.
