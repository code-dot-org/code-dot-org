Your organization does not need to have its own facilitators. Code.org Professional Learning Partners can  opt to contract with local Code.org approved facilitators instead.

### **Can I recruit teachers from local districts to become a part of the 2016-17 CS Principles professional learning program?**

Our general rule: a teacher must be from a district that Code.org has a district partnership with to apply for the CS Principles professional learning program. However, you are welcome to encourage local teachers who have a spot on their master schedule to teach AP Computer Science Principles in the Fall to join our program's wait list.
