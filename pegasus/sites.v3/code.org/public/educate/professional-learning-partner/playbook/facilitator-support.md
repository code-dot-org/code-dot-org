#### Facilitators are key to building a sustainable computer science community in your region. They are the bridge between your organization and the teachers you serve and impact the quality of the professional learning programs. The following resources will help you sustain and grow a strong corps of local facilitators.

## Facilitator Application Process
The facilitator application will launch on November 1, 2016. If you have any questions about the Facilitator Application Process or your role in recruiting new facilitators, please refer to [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q8xi7xyFOIVLWWNfrW5g8WXvyk56ta4UwB3YnHKeBe4/edit).

## Example Facilitator One Pager
The facilitator one pager should be sent to facilitators at least 10 days prior to the workshop. It provides facilitators all of the logistical information needed to run their workshop.

Use <a href="/files/ExampleFacilitatorOnePager.pdf" target=_blank>this one pager</a> as an example of how to format the information that facilitators will need to run a successful workshop. 

________________
<a id="contract"></a>
## Example contract
[This is an example](/files/example-csp-facilitator-contract.pdf) of an agreement that facilitators sign when facilitating for Code.org. You should develop your own agreement for use with facilitators that meets your organization's particular needs, and which ensures that the terms of the Professional Learning Partner agreement you have signed with Code.org, particularly Section 3 (Indemnification), Section 6.1 (Description of Duties) and Section 7 (Confidential Information), are met. 

*DISCLAIMER: By providing this example, Code.org is not offering you legal advice. You should consult a lawyer if you need advice about contracts, the language therein, or any other legal matter.*
