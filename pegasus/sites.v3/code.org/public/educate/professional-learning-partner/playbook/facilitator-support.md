# Resources


### <a href="/files/ExampleFacilitatorOnePager.pdf" target=_blank>Example Facilitator One Pager</a>
This one pager is an example of how to format the information that facilitators will need to run a successful workshop. 

### [Example contract]() 
This contract is only an example of the agreement a facilitator will sign for Code.org. You should consult a lawyer for any advice about contracts, the language therein, or other legal advice about contracts.

### Facilitator Playbook - Coming Soon!
The facilitator playbook is a virtual guide that will be given to all facilitators to reference.
