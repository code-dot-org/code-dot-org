### The role of the facilitator & the Professional Learning Partner

# Resources


### <a href="/files/ExampleFacilitatorOnePager.pdf" target=_blank>Example Facilitator One Pager</a>
This one pager is an example of how to format the information that facilitators will need to run a successful workshop. 

### [Example contract](/files/example-csp-facilitator-contract.pdf) 
This is an example of an agreement that facilitators sign when facilitating for Code.org. You should develop your own agreement for use with facilitators that meets your organization's particular needs, and which ensures that the terms of the Professional Learning Partner agreement you have signed with Code.org, particularly Section 3 (Indemnification), Section 6.1 (Description of Duties) and Section 7 (Confidential Information), are met. 

DISCLAIMER: By providing this example, Code.org is not offering you legal advice. You should consult a lawyer if you need advice about contracts, the language therein, or any other legal matter.

### Facilitator Playbook - Coming Soon!
The facilitator playbook is a virtual guide that will be given to all facilitators to reference.
