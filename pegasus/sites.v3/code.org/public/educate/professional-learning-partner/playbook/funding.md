# How does your organization become sustainable?

This year most of your funding will come from Code.org
Important to start thinking about how you will sustain these programs without our funding over time

### Goals:
- 50% of funding needed for year 3 (2018-19 SY) raised by end of 2016-17 SY
- 100% of funding needed for year 3 raised by end of 2017-18 SY

Code.org will help make introductions where we have them and will host an event that you can use to get donors

### What should you start doing today?

- Create your prospect list of potential funders (who is likely to fund your Program Manager, etc.) 
- Project how much you need and how much you can raise from this list in 3-4 months 
-Start outreach to potential funders to pitch them through emails, calls or in person meetings 
- Use a special event as your “closer” event
