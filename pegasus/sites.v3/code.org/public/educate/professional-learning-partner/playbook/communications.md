## Tips for writing an awesome email
We know you’ll be sending out emails about community meetups, workshops, and other important information to your teachers. Here are some tips from Boomerang about how to make emails more effective. 
 
**Subject line:<br/>**

- Make sure you include a subject line! Aim for 3-4 words and keep it accurate. Tell your recipient what’s in the email. If you’re looking for an answer to a question, include the question in the subject. 

**Content:<br/>**

- Focus your email content, and plan out your communications so you don’t spam your recipients. 
- Use shorter sentences with simpler words. A 3rd grade reading level works best.
- Write short paragraphs, separated by blank links. Unbroken blocks of text don’t do well with recipients. 
- Include 1-3 questions in your email.
- Write enough, but not too much. Try to keep messages between 50-125 words.
- Take a stand! Opinionated messages see higher response rates than objective ones.
- Write with moderate emotion -- not neutral, but not excessive. Use a slightly positive or slightly negative tone. Both outperform a completely neutral tone. 
- Don’t use ALL CAPS to call out important messages. It looks like yelling, even if that’s not the intention.
