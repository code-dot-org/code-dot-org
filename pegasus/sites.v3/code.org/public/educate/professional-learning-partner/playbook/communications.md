# Communications Playbook

## Communications from Code.org
Code.org sends emails directly to teachers regarding information about any Code.org products, programs, or resources. This includes but is not limited to:<br/> Curriculum, professional learning program content, online module content, teacher dashboard tools and resources, Code Studio tools and resources, and other items related to the Code.org Professional Learning Program.

Code.org will provide partners at least 3 business daysâ€™ notice before sending communications directly to teachers regarding the Professional Learning Program. This **does not** include emails about Code Studio, Hour of Code, or advocacy campaigns. 

As long as teachers are users of Code Studio they will continue to receive emails from Code.org. Teachers will have the option to unsubscribe from different types of emails. Please make sure you check the [Technology Requirements](/educate/professional-learning-partner/playbook/teacher-support#technology) to be sure teachers are able to receive the emails from Code.org.

## Workshop Communications

There are two types of emails regarding logistical information for locally hosted professional development workshops:

**Automated emails:** <br/>
Participants who sign up for a workshop will receive the following automated emails from Code.org: 

- Sign up confirmation (upon signing up)
- 1st Workshop reminder and details (10 days prior to workshop)
- 2nd Workshop reminder and details (3 days prior to workshop)

Workshop organizers can add logistic information (location, time, notes) to these emails in the dashboard.

**Manual emails:** <br/>
The workshop organizer (PLP or district) is responsible for sending communications to sign up for workshops and any necessary additional information about workshop logistics. Code.org will not send information regarding workshops/signing up for locally-hosted workshops. These can include:

- Supplemental workshop reminders
- Specific dates to complete online modules
- Emails as needed for your region's teacher program timeline
- Specific information related to meetups and community events
