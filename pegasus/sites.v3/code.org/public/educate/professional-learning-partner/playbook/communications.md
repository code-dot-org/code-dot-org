# Communications Playbook

## Communications from Code.org
Code.org sends emails directly to teachers regarding information about any Code.org products, programs, or resources. Click the links below for an example of these emails. 

[**Professional Learning Program Updates**](http://us9.campaign-archive2.com/?u=dc783682a08c5eb6dfe447070&id=7f8734bcaa)<br/>
These emails include updates about the curriculum and online modules, teacher dashboard tools and resources, Code Studio tools and resources, and other items related to the Code.org Professional Learning Program.

Code.org will notify partners at least 3 business days before sending communications directly to teachers regarding the Professional Learning Program. This **does not** include emails about Code Studio, Hour of Code, or advocacy campaigns.

[**Teacher Community Updates**](http://teacherblog.code.org/post/130276889649/community-updates-october-2015)<br/>
These updates are related to the broader Computer Science community and about our organization's work we are doing outside of our Professional learning Programs.

Included are a couple examples of emails Code.org will send teachers. As long as teachers are Code studio users, they will receive a monthly update email from Code.org. Teachers will have the option to unsubscribe from different types of emails. Please make sure you check the [Technology Requirements](/educate/professional-learning-partner/playbook/teacher-support#technology) to be sure teachers are able to receive the emails from Code.org.

## Workshop Communications

There are two types of emails regarding logistical information for locally hosted professional development workshops; **automated emails** coming from the information in the workshop dashboard, and **manual emails** written by the Workshop Organizer to provide additional information. Click the links below to see examples:

### Automated emails: <br/>
Participants who sign up for a workshop will receive the following automated emails from Code.org. Click the links to see an example. 

[**Workshop Sign Up Confirmation**](/files/workshop_signup_confirmation.pdf)
<br/>This email will automatically send to a teacher that signs up for a workshop. 

[**Workshop Reminder Emails**](/files/workshop_reminder.pdf)
<br/>These emails will automatically send to every teacher that is signed up for a workshops 10 and 3 calendar days before a workshop. These include details about the location, dates, parking information and what to bring to the workshop.


Workshop organizers can add logistical information (location, time, notes) to these emails via their workshop information in the dashboard.

### Manual emails: <br/>
The workshop organizer (PLP or district) is responsible for sending communications to sign up for workshops and any necessary additional information about workshop logistics. Code.org will not send information regarding workshops/signing up for locally-hosted workshops. These can include:

- Supplemental workshop reminders
- Specific dates to complete online modules
- Emails as needed for the timeline of your region's program
- Emails about meetups and community events you organize
- Email asking teachers to register for the next workshop

### Tips for writing an awesome email
We know you’ll be sending out mail about community meetups, PD workshops, and other important information to your teachers. Here are some tips from Boomerang about how to make emails more effective.

**Subject line:<br/>**

- Make sure you include a subject line! Aim for 3-4 words and keep it accurate. Tell your recipient what’s in the email. If you’re looking for an answer to a question, include the question in the subject. 

**Content:<br/>**

- Focus your email content, and plan out your communications so you don’t spam your recipients. 
- Use shorter sentences with simpler words. A 3rd grade reading level works best.
- Write short paragraphs, separated by blank links. Unbroken blocks of text don’t do well with recipients. 
- Include 1-3 questions in your email.
- Write enough, but not too much. Try to keep messages between 50-125 words.
- Take a stand! Opinionated messages see higher response rates than objective ones.
- Write with moderate emotion -- not neutral, but not excessive. Use a slightly positive or slightly negative tone. Both outperform a completely neutral tone. 
- Don’t use ALL CAPS to call out important messages. It looks like yelling, even if that’s not the intention.
