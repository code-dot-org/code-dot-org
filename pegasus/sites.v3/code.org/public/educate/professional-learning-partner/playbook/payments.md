## Teacher Workshops
Code.org pays Professional Learning Partners for program expenses related to hosting workshops for teachers according to their contracts. These payments may include funds for facilitators at the workshops, costs for venue space and food during the workshop day, and compensation for time for a Professional Learning Partner staff member to plan and execute the workshop. 

Code.orgâ€™s payment cycles are the 1st-15th and 16th-last day of each month. In the two weeks following, Code.org prepares a report and sends it with payment for all workshops closed in that prior period. For example: if a workshop was held July 11-12th, the cycle would close July 15th, and Code.org would mail a check to the Professional Learning Partner by the end of July.

## Facilitators
**ECS, CS in Science, and CS in Algebra Facilitator Payments**

- All facilitators (veteran and facilitators in training) are paid $500 per workshop day. There is no urban multiplier applied to this amount as it is considered a pass through expense.

**CS Principles Facilitator Payments**

- All facilitators are paid $500 per workshop day. There is no urban multiplier applied to this amount as it is considered a pass through expense.
- Each Professional Learning Partner is responsible for contracting with and paying any facilitators who run local workshops (including local summer workshops in summer 2017).

## Administrator and Counselor Workshops
**What will Code.org pay for?**

Code.org will pay for up to 80 individuals to attend an Adminstrator or Counselor workshop. This includes printed materials & swag.

**How payments are calculated**

Your total rate for 2 workshops has been divided by 80 and turned into a per person rate which will be paid based on the number of individuals who attend each session. This was done to enable each of you to run more than 2 workshops throughout your region while still receiving the same amount of compensation. 

**Example:**<br/>
Per the MOU, Organization A is to receive:<br/>
Venue:  $400 x 2 workshops = $800<br/>
Food: 	 $20 per person x 80 people = $1,600<br/>
Staffer: $250 x 2 workshops = $500<br/>
Total:    $2,900

Per person rate Code.org will pay (up to 80 people): $2,900/80 = $36.25

**Can I Host Workshops for More than 80 People?**<br/>
Yes, but you will need to cover these costs. 

For swag, you can order additional swag bags and pay for them yourself through Mimeo. 
For printed materials, you can order additional through Mimeo and pay for them or make copies on your own.
Food, venue and staff time would also need to be covered by your organization.
