# Professional Learning Partner Program #

## About the Program

Code.org is selecting organizations, as partners, to help spread computer science in a local, sustainable fashion. The goal of the Professional Learning Partner program is to help each organization establish itself as a local partner of the Code.org professional learning community, with an expectation that in the long-run each partner organization can sustain this work independently of Code.org.

Each partner's program manager will attend our Program Manager Summit, a fabulous experience designed to welcome Professional Learning Partners to the extended Code.org family. In addition, we will provide funding based on demonstrated need to help each organization establish itself as a local Code.org professional learning partner.

The ideal Professional Learning Partner is a U.S. based regional education unit, a non-profit, or a university with existing, positive relationships with nearby school districts and the local education community.
