# Professional Learning Partner Program #

## About the Program

Code.org is selecting organizations, as partners, to help teach computer science in a local, sustainable fashion. We view these to be long-term partnerships with selected partners joining a network of organizations supporting a nationwide computer science movement.
 
Each partner's program manager will attend our Facilitation Summit, a fabulous experience designed to welcome Professional Learning Partners and facilitators to the extended Code.org family. In addition, we will provide the initial funding to help each organization establish itself as a local Code.org professional learning partner.

The ideal Professional Learning Partner is a regional education unit, a non-profit, a school district, or a university with existing, positive relationships with nearby school districts and the local education community. We hope you will apply!

## What we'd expect of you
Below is a list of program commitments:

- Provide a dedicated Professional Learning Partner Program Manager who will participate fully in the Program Manager onboarding & on-going program management responsibilities. (this is a 0.15 FTE time commitment at first, but will grow with time)
- Attend our Facilitation Summit, May 20-22, 2016 in New Orleans, LA, and our 5-day Code.org TeacherCon with teachers from your state (dates vary). 
- Organize and host quality, local workshops for Code.org’s district partners implementing Code.org’s high school and middle school programs, with Code.org-accredited facilitators
- Build, grow and sustain a local community of computer science educators (or join an existing community)
- Develop independent funding sources for the long-term sustainability of the work (with Code.org's cooperation)
 
 
## What Code.org will provide in return
- Funding for your work in the initial year(s)
- Marketing your organization as the official Code.org Professional Learning Partner for your region
