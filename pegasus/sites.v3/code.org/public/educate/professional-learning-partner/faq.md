### **My region is already served by another organization, can I stil apply to be a Professional Learning Partner?**

For this year, we are only looking for professional learning partners in regions where Code.org is not already working with another organization. If you are interested in participating in local Professional Learning for the 2017-18 school year, please email partner@code.org and we will connect you with the Professional Learning Partner for your area.
