### Outreach ###

- Authorize use of the “Code.org Professional Learning Partner” logo on promotional materials the Professional Learning Partner develops.

### Community ###

### Funding ###
- For each cohort of teachers, Code.org will work with the partner to determine how much funding to provide based on demonstrated need to cover the following: an onsite staffer, facilitator compensation, food, and venue <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zuxMqmkhVOzAu22YgOEX61dG4xfgnw_jG0Z0-E-DMzY/edit#gid=0" target=_blank>(see example budget here)</a>. You may work out a different schedule of workshops with the local school districts, as long as it’s within these costs.
- Provide access to workshop supplies as well as materials for teachers such as a virtual curriculum guide containing course lesson plans, certificates of completion, and classroom supplies for some activities.

### Metrics/Evaluation ###
- Evaluate your success based on shared metrics (noted above) -- growth of number of teachers and students in the region, implementation of courses, diversity, and quality of workshops.

## Joint Commitment
- We will cooperate together to transition your work to 100% local funding by year 3 of the partnership. Our vision for this is that the long-term funding comes from state or local sources but we expect that you will lead the fundraising in your local area. We can provide guidance, introductions, sample grant applications, etc. as needed, and establish you as a Code.org-accredited provider. In some regions, we may also be able to connect you to local funders.
- We will collaborate to establish your organization as a certified regional provider of computer science PD, so teachers from local districts can receive formal PD credit.
- We will cooperate to identify, recruit, build and maintain local facilitator capacity. Facilitators need to meet Code.org’s established selection criteria.


We view this to be a long-term partnership. We see your organization as joining a network of organizations supporting a nationwide movement to build local computer science hubs. We hope to find many ways beyond the scope of this document to cooperate in spreading computer science in K-12 schools. That could mean hosting workshops for elementary school teachers, cooperating on state level policy efforts, or more. For now, we want to focus on a limited set of work to begin our relationship.

This is not a binding document. This is a new program, so Code.org may change some of these terms in subsequent years.
