            <h2>Overview</h2>
            
                <p>The core idea of this lesson occurs in the unplugged activity that kicks off the lesson, in which students try to keep track of IP addresses that had been randomly assigned to each student in the class, while at the same time the teacher occasionally changes students’ addresses.  This leads to identifying the need for an authoritative system for name-to-address mappings, known as the Domain Name System or <span class="vocab" title="DNS: The service that translates URLs to IP addresses.">DNS</span>.</p>
<p>Students then briefly experiment with a DNS protocol in the Internet Simulator.  The activity is similar, in that students will have to grapple with IP addresses changing in real time and use the built in DNS protocol to resolve the issues. </p>
<p>The lesson ends with students doing some rapid research about DNS and some of its vulnerabilities, particularly what are known as Denial of Service Attacks.</p>
            

            
                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                
                    <p>The basic purpose of this lesson is to show students in kinesthetic and interactive ways some of the challenges solved, and created by, DNS.  At its core, the DNS is “simply” a hierarchical system of computers and databases, that maps IP addresses to domain names. It enables Internet users to connect human-language locations on the Internet with numeric addresses used by IP. While distributed and hierarchical, it can be treated in the abstract as a centralized registry of locations on the Internet, allowing users to quickly find locations they are looking for and register themselves so that others may find them. </p>

<p>This Getting Started activity is a bit more involved than usual.  It will probably take 10-15 minutes to complete and requires a lot of physical movement.  The “Activity” portion of the lesson may be a little shorter than usual.</p>

<p><strong>As students walk into class…</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hand each student a single IP address (precut by teacher from <a class="resource" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16AFJlOGhuzEqfwblFynKUT9VNbOuNeekXD8nWKCBbJ8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">IP Address Labels</a>). Students should be instructed to hold onto their IP addresses, not share them, and await instructions.</li>

<p><strong>Background Info for the Activity</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>When computers talk to one another on the web, they don’t refer to each other by names; they use an IP address to indicate who they are and who they are sending a message to. Without this system, the packets would be impossible to route across the Internet. The problem with this system is that, while computers are fine with referring to other computers by numbers, humans are really terrible at remembering long strings of seemingly-random numbers. We’d prefer to identify a web page by its name, and besides, it makes remembering our favorite locations on the Internet (“Code.org” vs. 174.129.14.120) much easier!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="guide">
<h3 id="dns-unplugged">DNS Unplugged</h3>
<p><strong><em>Instructions:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When you walked in, I handed you a slip of paper with an IP address on it.</li>
<li>You also should have a <a href="Names and Addresses" target="_blank">Worksheet - Names and Addresses</a>. </li>
<li>For the next 5 minutes, your goal is to complete an accurate list of IP addresses and names for all students in the room. You may only talk to one person at a time, but you may exchange as much information with that person as you want.</li>
<li><strong>GO!</strong></li>

<p>Students may object that you’re making the task impossible. Part of the point of the exercise is that people’s IP addresses change all the time, and it’s difficult to keep track if no one, or no system, can be appealed to as an authority for name-to-address mappings.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>You don’t need to linger with this activity, once you think students see what’s happening. Do enough to make the point and move onto the discussion.</p>

<li>Approach a student and silently take their IP address slip away from them.</li>
<li>Give that person a new IP address slip (or a re-used IP address).</li>

<p>Students should understand that this is a realistic scenario – IP addresses change all the time. This system of everybody-keep-track-of-your-own-list is highly inefficient. Every student is developing an identical list to one another. A central list would be better, and the Internet has a system for that.</p>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li><em>Prompt:</em> Why did I keep taking your IP addresses?<ul>
<li>This simulates the fact that a computer’s IP address does not stay the same.  For example, a person’s IP address on their phone changes quite frequently as they move around throughout their day and their phone tries to connect to the Internet from different locations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Prompt:</em> Do you think the system we just simulated is an efficient way of collecting IP addresses? Are there any inefficiencies you observe? How could it be made better?<ul>

<h3 id="dns-in-the-internet-simulator">DNS in the Internet Simulator</h3>
<p>(Explanation also in activity guide)</p>
<p>When you go to the Internet Simulator now, you will see a “DNS server” attached to the router.  In order to communicate with someone else, you must first find their IP address by asking the DNS.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To begin, click over to the “DNS” tab to see all the hostnames of people on the router.  You will see the address of the DNS (always 15) but will not see an address for anyone else on the router.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The DNS server responds to a text protocol that will give you someone’s IP address. The protocol is:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><code>GET &lt;hostnameOfPerson&gt;</code></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><code>GET madeline4</code></p>
<ol>
<li>After the DNS has returned an IP address, you can type that IP address into the “To” field, enter a message, and then press “send.”</li>
</ol>
<div class="guide">

<p>(from the activity guide)</p>
<div class="admonition content">

<div>
<p>Especially in the world of mobile devices it is very common for a device to lose an IP address and need to re-acquire one - entering a tunnel, flying on a plane, even moving from one WiFi hotspot to the next.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>It is true that at this point in time it’s less likely that a web site with a registered domain name (like Code.org, google.com, or facebook.com) would rapidly change IP addresses, but the great thing about DNS is that even if they did, that change would be transparent to the public and you won’t have to worry about it.  Even so huge operations like Facebook, Twitter, etc. actually serve their sites on many hundreds (or thousands) of computers, all with different IP addresses - DNS helps manage that too, so you can just type Microsoft.com and it direct you to the right place.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>As an analogy, think about a time when a friend or family member changed their phone number.  That affects everyone who needs to know that number and causes some annoying problems.  If we had a system like DNS for phone numbers, you’d never have to concern yourself with anything but remembering the person’s name.  Of course, every person on earth would have to have a unique name for this to work, so it’s a bit impractical.</p>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You are going to interview/have a conversation with a classmate using only the Internet Simulator.  We’ve created a list of interview questions (on the next page) and you should both jot down each other’s responses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To find the person, you will have to ask the DNS for her IP address.  When you have retrieved the IP address, start the interview.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><div class="tiplink tiplink-content"><a href="#content_newip"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-education"></i></a></div>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>HOWEVER….As you’re working, if your teacher taps you and your partner, you <strong>both MUST disconnect and reconnect from the simulation</strong>.  This is to simulate changing IP addresses. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even though your IP address will change, your hostname will stay the same, so you’ll need to re-join a router and ask the DNS for your partner’s new IP address in order to continue having your conversation!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Teacher Participation:</strong> </p>
<p>As in the previous activity, you will “interfere” with the students’ activity by walking around the room and directing <strong>BOTH members of a pair to disconnect and reconnect.</strong>  </p>
<p>When an IP address changes, there is no visual cue to anyone else on the Internet that the person they are talking to has moved. </p>
<p>Instead, they should send a request to the DNS to make sure that the IP address is correct every time they want to send a person a message.</p>

<p>Some answers to the discussion questions:</p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>The Internet is basically a network of computers sending messages to request information and computers replying to messages to satisfy information requests. Computers need to identify “from” and “to” for all messages. Computer speak in numbers, not names.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>All communication online is via IP addresses. However, we are more familiar with human readable names, most notably URLs like “Code.org” or “Google.com.”</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>We need a way to translate human-readable names into IP addresses.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>It is inefficient for everyone on the Internet to maintain a table of IP addresses.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>The DNS is NOT centralized, but it’s not completely autonomous and distributed like routing, either.  There is a hierarchical system of servers to maintain an authoritative table that, like a phone book, others can consult when they need to find an address.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>A properly functioning DNS system requires collaborative efforts among all users to ensure it is up to date and accurate.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<li>Why does the Internet use IP addresses?</li>
<li>Why don’t we need to know IP addresses?</li>
<li>Why do we need a Domain Name System?</li>
<li>Why don’t we all maintain our own DNS?</li>
<li>Is there one big DNS for the entire Internet?</li>
<li>How do you think all these DNS servers are maintained?</li>

<p>A single central register of IP addresses and names (i.e. a DNS-style system) is an efficient means of translating human-readable names to IP addresses. Which of the following is NOT solved by DNS?</p>

<p>b) There are too few IP addresses to meet the current demand.</p>
<p>c) When someone new joins the Internet, they need to inform everyone of their IP address.</p>
<p>d) When an IP address changes, it is impossible to locate a computer until the owner announces the change.</p>
