The first lesson is about getting students excited about the course and connecting their own personal interests to computer science.  Students are asked to share something they know a lot about and teach it to a small group.  Groups make a “rapid” prototype of an innovative idea and share it.  Students watch a brief video about computing innovations.  The lesson ends with students logging into the Code.org CSP course web site, and answering a brief prompt about what “computer science” means to them.</span>

Students will think about what can be usefully conveyed in such a simple message and build a “device” to communicate the message over some physical distance. 
Then students are asked to consider how to use their binary messaging devices to send a more complex message - a message with more than two possibilities, say four, or eight, or even thousands of different messages. Students will collaborate in an iterative design process in the “maker ethos” of rapidly building and improving their “device” for sending messages.</span>

Today, the Internet Simulator will be used to simulate a single shared wire, connecting two people.  The wire can only be in one of two possible states (state A or state B) and either partner may set or read the state of the wire at any time, but this is the only way in which students may communicate.  Students must invent a binary call-response protocol using this system. Coordination, speed and timing are problems that need to be solved. At the conclusion of the lesson, students compete to demonstrate the speed and accuracy of their protocols, and calculate the bit rate of their message exchange.</span>

Students are asked to create rules that explain how each arrangement of symbols can be generated or predicated as an orderly, logical series.  The objective is to understand that you can represent any number with any agreed-upon set of symbols that appear in an agreed-upon order. This is as true for circles, triangle and squares as it is for the digits 0-9, or the number systems we commonly see in computer science (binary and hexadecimal).</span>

The lesson will transition away from the number systems that students created in the the circle-triangle-square activity, and begin to focus on representing numeric values using the binary number system. Though students have communicated with Binary before, developing a number system is a little different. Previously, students mapped patters of binary values to a small, fixed set of messages. A number system is infinite, and also has rules for counting - or how to get from one value to the next.</span>

Students will be presented a grid on which they will draw their image (connecting 3-7 dots with straight lines). They must develop a protocol which will allow them to send any image they might create on their grids, paying particular attention to how many bits are used to represent each binary number. Students will therefore have additional practice encoding and decoding binary numbers and develop further intuitions about the properties of binary numbers in a hands-on way. The lesson concludes by testing protocols using a teacher-supplied test-image to transmit. </span>

The real challenge is not in solving a particular instance of the minimum spanning tree, but to develop an algorithm, a clear series of steps, that if followed properly, will solve any instance of the problem. There is a possible misconception to look out for: the MST has a definite, verifiable optimal solution, as opposed to the Text Compression problem (from Unit 1), which does not.</span>

Building off of the previous lesson about shortest path algorithms, the activity in this lesson shows how routers learn about the rest of the Internet in order to route traffic so it takes the shortest path. In the previous lessons, students use the Internet Simulator to send packets to other students through simulated routers. The path that the packet follows, and how the router knows where to send it, however, has been largely untouched. Today, students simulate the process of a router joining a network and generating a router table that would allow them to send packets to anyone else in their network as efficiently as possible. They then reflect on the process by comparing the similarities between the SSSP problem and the process the used today, and how it facilitates the structure of the Internet.</span>
