            <h2>Overview</h2>
            
                <p>In this lesson, students explore more deeply how communication between multiple computers can work over the Internet. They do this by playing a simplified game of Battleship, in which the first game is played unplugged, in their table groups, and the second game is played using the Internet Simulator, so that multiple students can connect to each other and see each other’s messages. Students must devise a messaging protocol that makes it clear who is sending the message and who the intended recipient is.</p>
<p>Students then devise a <em>binary protocol</em> for playing this game which will entail developing an addressing system for players, as a well as a formal packet structure for transmitting data about the state of the game.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: this is a large lesson that will likely need to span 2 days of class.</p>
            

            
                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                
                    <p>This lesson builds up to students learning about the “Internet Protocol” addressing system, commonly known as <span>IP Addresses</span>.</p>
<p>Up to this point in the course, the Internet Simulator has only assumed point-to-point communication.  The “protocols” students were inventing mostly had to do with encoding information in binary, rather than also encoding communication information required for successful delivery of the message.</p>
<p>The lesson mimics a real problem that designers of the internet had to solve. Many computers are connected together by networks. So if a computer sends some bits out, those bits pass through many computers. How does a computer know who those bits are for?  If a response is necessary, how does it send it back?  This is a complicated question, but the first part of the answer is that you need an addressing system, and some kind of fixed structure for messages that everyone agrees on (a protocol) so messages can be interpreted properly.  (We’ll get to routing later).</p>
<p>The Internet Simulator for this lesson is setup to “broadcast” every message to every person in the group. Since everyone receives any bits that were sent by anyone else, a method for identifying the intended sender and receiver of the message is needed. Students will invent a protocol for addressing messages.</p>
<p>Many network systems, such as local ethernet and WiFi, rely on addressing schemes to make sure bits are received by the correct computer based on address and for other computers to simply ignore messages not intended for them. </p>

<li>In our version today, you will play in <strong>groups of 3</strong> (4 is OK)</li>
<li>To make it easier to track, we’ve also simplified the playing board to just a <strong>3x3 grid</strong> (instead of the classic 10x10)</li>

<p><strong>Why Battleship?</strong>  </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Teachers may want to substitute other games for battleship in this activity for a variety of reasons.  However, if you do that be aware that battleship was chosen because it has several properties that force concepts of internet protocols to come out.  Battleship has a relatively fixed size message length, a need to encode several different pieces of information (coordinates), to and from addressing, and a verification message (hit or miss).</p>

<p>(From the Activity Guide)</p>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Previously you came up with a method for exchanging messages on an open broadcast channel to play multiple games of Battleship at once. Now that you’ve played Battleship this way, with your group or with a partner, describe an efficient <strong>binary protocol for playing a 3-person game of Battleship that can be played accurately over the Internet Simulator.</strong>  </p>
<p>Let “efficient” mean that your protocol uses the smallest reasonable number of bits (0s and 1s) to make messages for Battleship that still contain all of the necessary information for playing the game.</p>
<p>
</p><div class="tiplink tiplink-tip"><a href="#tip_protocols"><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i></a></div>

<p><strong>Give groups about 10 minutes to work</strong></p>

<div class="admonition discussion">
<p class="admonition-title" id="discussion_solution"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-comment"></i>Discussion Goal</p>
<div></div>
<div>
<p>A good solution uses a <strong>numeric</strong> address (not tied to a person’s name) and a <strong>fixed length</strong> message. The number allows you to uniquely identify players (like a phone number) and having a fixed length helps know where each “chunk” of the message starts and ends.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>How many bits do you need for addresses?</strong> – For 3-person Battleship, you only need 2 bits for an address, since there are only 3 people; each can have a unique code.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>How many bits are needed for the total message?</strong> – Answers to this will vary and creativity should be encouraged.  However, it should be evident from the students’ protocols that they recognize the fundamental elements of the game and what might be able to be compressed into only a few bits. </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>(See the example solution).</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3 id="discuss-share">Discuss &amp; Share</h3>
<p>After groups have had some time to work bring the class together.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask if any group would like to share their protocol</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><div class="tiplink tiplink-discussion"><a href="#discussion_solution"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-comment"></i></a></div>
<p></p>
<p>After the group has presented open up the discussion to draw out similarities and differences.  Here are a few prompts:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“Did any other group do something similar? or something completely different?</em>“</li>
<li><em>“What pieces of information were common across all of the protocols? Sender, recipient, cell number, hit/miss info.</em>“</li>
<li><em>“If we were to play a different game, what data would stay the same? What would change?</em>“</li>
</ul>
<p>Use this question to <strong>transition</strong> to the wrap-up:</p>
<p><strong>What do you think all of this has to do with the Internet?</strong></p>
<div class="guide">
<h3 id="optional-exemplar-solution">(Optional) Exemplar Solution</h3>
<p><strong>You may choose to share this with your students or not</strong>.  You might just use this exemplar as background knowledge to help you guide students’ solutions.</p>
<p><em>A simple, but clever encoding protocol is to recognize that the addresses, coordinates, and hit/miss messages can each be encoded with 2 bits (i.e. a list of 5 numbers in the range 0-3), and that you can make a combined message protocol that would allow a player to communicate anything needed for the game.</em></p>
<p><em>The scheme shown below uses 10 bits total. The last two bits are interesting: they indicate whether this is a shot being fired for the given row and column or whether it’s a hit/miss response to the given row and column.  Since the respondent who says hit or miss must verify the coordinates of the shot they are responding to, the recipient doesn’t have to remember the last shot they called.</em></p>

<p>It turns out computers on the Internet are addressed in a similar way to phones for many of the same reasons.  The real addresses used on the Internet are called “Internet Protocol Addresses” or <span class="vocab" title="IP Address: A number assigned to any item that is connected to the Internet.">IP Address</span>es for short.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Do some rapid research (Optional)</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>At this point, you could have students look up the real IP <span class="vocab" title="Packets: Small chunks of information that have been carefully formed from larger chunks of information.">packet</span> structure and it might make some sense to them.  They might find it satisfying and empowering to be able to understand a more technical article.  The Wikipedia article on IPv4 packets shows how all the bits are laid out: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4#Packet_structure</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>However, we have not yet covered a major aspect of packets, and the real need for their existence, which is that they are used to breakdown very large messages into smaller chunks to improve reliability of transmission.  <strong>We cover packets in a future lesson</strong>.</p>

<p>You may <strong>stop the video at 4:10</strong> so that only the content on IP addresses is covered, as DNS will be covered later. In this case, you should split the video worksheet into two parts.</p>

<p>You should review the material covered in the video.</p>
<p>The questions in the <a class="resource" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YSWsBrwuzqG0TzVXyH7Boi7XUrlPuslHxwZy0vVVjZY" target="_blank">IP and DNS Video Worksheet (Optional)</a> are a good place to start.  The essential ideas and vocabulary students should know are:</p>

<li>IPv4  versus IPv6</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Optional Quick activity:</strong> What’s the IP address of the computer you’re using right now?</p>
<p>There are a number of ways to figure out your IP address.  An exploratory way is to do a web search for: *”What’s my IP address?”</p>
<p>That will lead to finding something, but you should be cautioned that the answer isn’t always simple.  </p>
<p>For example, if you are in a computer lab and use a site like <a href="http://whatismyipaddress.com/" target="_blank">What’s my IP Address?</a> it’s likely that all of the computers in the classroom will report the same address.  This is because the computers in a computer lab are probably using the same shared connection and might look to the outside world like they’re all coming from the same place.</p>
<p>You can also look at a computer’s settings to see what it thinks it’s IP address is.</p>

<p>a) heuristic</p>
<p>b) algorithm</p>
<p>c) protocol  </p>
<p>d) encoding</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which of the following information is not necessary in your protocol to play Battleship?</p>
<p>a) cell number</p>
<p>b) from</p>
<p>c) to</p>
<p>d) time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even with a good protocol, what are some privacy and security challenges while playing Battleship on the Internet Simulator?</p>

<li><strong>Security and Privacy:</strong> If the messaging scheme your group designed was really used on the Internet, what could go wrong in terms of security and privacy? Think about what a malicious person could do. What if the messages sent weren’t about a game but about something more personal like a conversation with a friend, or communicating with a bank?<ul>
<li>There are two major security problems with the current version:<ul>
<li>Anyone can fake a return address. Bob could send you a message and claim it’s “from Alice,” and you’d have no way to confirm who sent it.</li>
<li>Everyone can view everyone else’s messages! Because all messages are “broadcast” over Internet Simulator, messages have no expectation of privacy.</li>
