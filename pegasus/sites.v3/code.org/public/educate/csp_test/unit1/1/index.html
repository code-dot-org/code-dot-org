    <meta name="description" content="Welcome to Computer Science Principles! The first lesson is about getting students excited about the course and connecting their own personal interests to computer science. Students are asked to share something they know a lot about and teach it to a small group. Groups make a “rapid” prototype of an innovative idea and share it. Students watch a brief video about computing innovations. The lesson ends with students logging into the Code.org CSP course web site, and answering a brief prompt about what “computer science” means to them.">

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            
                <p>Welcome to Computer Science Principles! The first lesson is about getting students excited about the course and connecting their own personal interests to computer science.  Students are asked to share something they know a lot about and teach it to a small group.  Groups make a “rapid” prototype of an innovative idea and share it.  Students watch a brief video about computing innovations.  The lesson ends with students logging into the Code.org CSP course web site, and answering a brief prompt about what “computer science” means to them.</p>
            

            
                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                
                    <p>This activity plants the initial seed for students to think about the ways in which they might be able to solve some problems relevant to their lives with technological innovations.  The AP CS Principles framework describes 6 Computational Thinking Practices that need to be evident in the course.  This first lesson is more about beginning to engage with those practices - beginning to think, act, and behave like computer scientists.  In particular, the practices in which students should be engaged in this lesson are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>P1: Connecting Computing</strong>: Describe connections between people and computing. </li>
<li><strong>P5: Communicating</strong>:  Describe computation and the impact of technology and computation.</li>
<li><strong>P6: Collaborating</strong>: Foster a constructive, collaborative climate by facilitating the contributions of a team member; exchange knowledge and feedback with a partner or team member.</li>
</ul>

<p>What you’re trying to do here is get students to state something that they are interested in, but also know a lot about - something they might have insights into.  A big part of students’ enthusiasm for sharing will come from your enthusiasm and genuine interest in getting to know them.  Students might need prodding: there is something that makes them interesting and unique.  Something they like to do, have interest in, read about, have some expertise in, a hidden talent.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Give students 1 minute to write that thing down on a post-it and stick it on the wall</strong> (putting name on the post-it is optional)  Note: if you don’t have post-its, use note cards and tape, or scraps of paper.  Anything that allows for these topics/areas of interest to be seen in one place.
- Survey the post-its on the wall to see the diversity of responses, maybe invite students to do this as well.</p>
<h3 id="group-introduction-and-share-out">Group introduction and share out</h3>
<ul>
<li>Take post-its and make groups of 4 that represent a diverse set of interests.  <ul>
<li>For example, grab: “video games”, “basketball”, “cooking”, “growing vegetables”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once in groups, give each student 3 minutes to:<ul>
<li>introduce themselves</li>
<li>explain the thing they know a lot about</li>
<li>teach the group something about it, or tell the group something interesting about it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>You may want to set a timer and tell them when to switch.</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="identify-impacts-and-prototype-an-innovation">Identify impacts and prototype an innovation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Remarks: <ul>
<li><em>People seem to say that technology is all around us, that it affects everything we do.  Is that true?  Technological <span class="vocab" title="Innovation: A novel or improved idea, device, product, etc, or the development thereof.">innovation</span> is about recognizing a problem that needs to be solved, or recognizing something needs improving and then building a tool to solve it.</em>  </li>
<li><strong>As a class we’re going to see how innovative we can be.  We’re going to do something called “rapid prototyping.”</strong>   (Prototype is a fancy word that means a preliminary sketch of an idea or model for something new.  It’s the original drawing from which something real might be built or created.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="instructions-part-1">Instructions - part 1:</h4>
<p>For the things of interest within each group, go around and:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to identify some way that technology is used with, or affects that thing</li>
<li>Make a suggestion for either:<ul>
<li>a way that technology might be improved to make it better, faster, easier to use
some problem, or aspect of that thing, that a creative or innovative technology might help solve, or at least make better?</li>
<li>Everyone in the group should make suggestions for any of the areas of interest at your table - you are not limited to your original thing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition say">
<p class="admonition-title" id="say_None"><i class="fa fa-microphone"></i>Remarks</p>
<div>
<p><strong>As a group brainstorm about the technology ideas at the table.  Get excited about one.</strong> As a group, nominate the idea you’ve discussed that you think would be the <em>most interesting</em> to everyone else in the class. </p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Start to sketch it out on a poster.  Make a visual representation of your ideas.</strong>  Remember this is a rapid prototype.  Just something to quickly convey the idea.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title" id="tip_None"><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i>Teaching Tip</p>
<div>
<p>Keep things quick.  If a group is worried about not being innovative enough, remind them that very small ideas can have big consequences.  People once thought it was ridiculous that you would want to send a short text message to another person over a phone.  Alternatively, a group may have a great idea that they want to spend more time on.  They can do that later.  For now, just remind them it’s a rapid prototype.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Put prototype posters on the wall
Survey the results
Time permitting, ask an individual from each group to explain what the the thing is what their innovation is.
If time is short, ask for one or two volunteers, or hand pick a poster or two for a student to explain.  You can leave the posters up for people to look at tomorrow.</p>

<p>Take this opportunity to explain the importance of bringing individual interests and perspectives to this course. Students are not only encouraged to find areas of personal interest in this course, it is actually mandated as part of the Performance Tasks. From day one, students should be thinking about how to apply the principles they learn to their own lives, and hopefully they will be excited to do so.</p>

<p>If this is your first time teaching this course, you may not know exactly how to present an entire year of activities and exploration on the first day. The text below is one possible way to contextualize today’s activity and build excitement about the rest of the year. Feel free to do what best matches your own style, and use the ideas to craft your own presentation of the course.</p>

<ul>
<li>We are just starting this class, but you all bring passions and knowledge about things you care about. And whatever those things are it is likely (if not inevitable) that they involve computing technology in some way.</li>
<li>This class is about the principles of computer science.  The principles that underlie much of the technology around us.</li>
<li>The reason this class exists is because not enough people in our school/town/city/country/world know or understand things about computer science. Not enough people know the basics that you need to know to be able to see where you can make a difference. Not enough diverse views, interests, opinions exist among the people who do more than use technology - they create new technology</li>
<li>This class is about taking a step in that direction.  </li>
<li>Your job as a student in the class is to be on the lookout, to be alert, for where and how computer science affects or impacts the things you care about, the things you know about.  Whatever it is you want to do in your life, it’s pretty likely that technology affects it in some way, or that some technological innovation is called for.</li>
<li>In fact, for the AP assessment you must create an app that reflects a personal interest or problem you’re trying to solve.  You must also explore a technological innovation and write about it.</li>
<li>Don’t worry, we’ll practice these things, and through the course you’ll learn about the principles that underlie all this stuff.</li>
<li>The way the class works, we often ask you to invent your own solution to problems.  Even if it’s a problem that’s been solved before, thinking like a computer scientist is a different mindset to be in.  We study a lot of things in this class not only because it’s foundational knowledge, but because of the <em>way it makes you think</em>, they way it asks you to solve problems, on your own or in collaboration with others.</li>
<li>Inventing things, and having insights about how things work, and how they might work better is what this class is about.  Everyone has the ability to contribute.  Everyone has unique insights into something.  Whatever it is you care about, whatever it is that makes you different, is the value you bring to the class.  Everyone is unique, but we’re all in this together.</li>
