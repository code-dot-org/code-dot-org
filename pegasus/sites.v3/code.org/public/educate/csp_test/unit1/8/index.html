            <h2>Overview</h2>
            
                <p>This lesson sets the the stage for why we want to learn about how the Internet works. First students share what they currently know about how the Internet works through a KWL activity.  </p>
<p>Then students watch a short video the introduces Vint Cerf and the Internet at high level.  Students then skim a memo written to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) by Vint Cerf in 2002 entitled “The Internet is for Everyone,” which calls out a series of threats to the prospect that the Internet should be an open, easily and cheaply accessible resource for everyone on the planet. </p>
<p>Finally we foreshadow the practice PT at the end of the unit.  Many of the questions and challenges raised by Vint Cerf still apply today, and students will be asked to research and present on one for the Practice PT.</p>
            

            
                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                
                    <p>The purpose of this lesson is to set up and motivate students to be receptive to learning about some of the technical aspects of how the Internet functions. We want the message to be clear that a huge part of being able to solve these problems, or even to function as an informed citizen, is to be educated about how the Internet actually works as a system that is built, engineered, and maintained by people.</p>
<p>It is both interesting and important to know that the protocols or rules by which Internet traffic is governed are not owned or controlled by any government or business (at the moment).  It’s a group of well-meaning citizen-engineers dedicated to keeping the Internet free, open and robust for all.  </p>
<p>The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is the group of mostly volunteer citizens that proposes and develops all of the standards and protocols that exist on the Internet. Request for Comments (RFC) documents - like the one we use in the lesson - are how these standards and protocols are defined and published for all to see on the IETF website.  They are some of the best-written technical documents in existence. </p>
<p>And with a little background in how bits work, what’s necessary for protocols to work when bits are transferred over wires, they are relatively accessible reading. Here’s the full set: https://www.ietf.org/rfc.html. RFC 000 (the first one) is related to what we ask students to do in the next several lessons.</p>

<li>So far in this class you have solved a few problems by creating and using small protocols for transmitting data over a wire to one other person.</li>
<li>But the Internet is obviously <em>much bigger</em> than a single wire connecting two people. It connects billions of people and even more billions of machines.  </li>
<li>In the next several lessons, we’re going to look at some of the technical issues involved with having lots of machines trying to communicate at the same time.</li>
<li>In other words, we’re going to take a deep dive into the inner-workings of the Internet.</li>

<p>Don’t linger too much with this introduction or the subsequent activity.  This lesson is intended to be a quick one-day motivator lesson to have students understand the scale of the questions we’re going to consider about the Internet and why learning about how the Internet functions is an important part of addressing those questions intelligently.

<p>When doing KWL as a group you should be cautious about accidentally making it seem like you’re trying to make students feel “dumb” by exposing what they don’t know. The Internet is complicated and hard for <em>anyone</em> to explain all at once.  The point of the exercise is three-fold:
1. Get the bits and pieces that students do know of how the Internet works out into the open because you can refer back to these later.
2. That will hopefully generate a bunch of questions about how the Internet actually works - which we are likely to address in this unit or in unit 4
3. Motivate a desire to answer those questions, both intrinsically, out of genuine curiosity, and extrinsically, because of the Practice PT that concludes the unit.</p>

<p>Cluster ideas by type, in a way that seems to make sense to you. Some categories that might come up:</p>

<p>In the video Vint Cerf says that nobody and everybody is in charge of making the internet work but the reason it all works together because everyone uses the same protocols. </p>
</div>

<p>So who develops these protocols?  Who makes the final decisions?  Who is in charge?  The amazing thing is that no single person, government, or corporation is in charge.  </p>

<p>(This text is in the full version of the handout)</p>
<p>After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Vint Cerf was concerned about maintaining some of the principles of openness and access upon which the Internet was built and founded.  </p>
<p>He wrote a memo entitled <strong>The Internet is for Everyone</strong> as a plea to the the people who write and define standards (the IETF) to make sure the way the Internet is engineered maintained the philosophy that the Internet should be available and useable by everyone in the world, regardless of race, gender, creed, location, or wealth.  </p>
<p>In the memo, he lays out the state of the Internet and its usage in 2002, predicts the future, and then presents a series of nine challenges or threats to the idea that the Internet is for everyone. The last several paragraphs begin with the phrase: <strong>“Internet is for everyone - but it won’t be if…</strong></p>
<p><strong>Instructions for students</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>With a partner, skim the document</strong> and look at the 9 “Internet is for everyone - but it won’t be if…” challenges laid out at the end.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>With your partner pick one or two of the challenges</strong> that are the most meaningful to you, or relate to some experience you’ve had in your life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be prepared to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Read the statement you chose: “Internet is for everyone - but it won’t be if….” and then explain in your own words what it means.</li>
<li>Explain why that particular challenge is meaningful to you or relates to some experience you’ve had.</li>

<p>The important factor here is to make the class student-centered.  They should get to know each other’s stories.  From the students’ examples, there should emerge at least a few powerful examples how much the Internet means to our society, our quality of life, and freedoms.  Difficult economic issues of access to the Internet may emerge, as might sensitive issues related to cyberbullying or crime.  Be sensitive to these issues if they emerge.</p>

                    <p>The “Internet is for Everyone” is actually a philosophy about how people should be connected.  That philosophy is expressed in the way the Internet standards and protocols were engineered.  In order to understand that philosophy over the next several lessons we’ll be learning about the systems of protocols that work together to make the internet function.</p>
<h3 id="foreshadow-the-practice-pt-internet-and-society">Foreshadow the Practice PT: Internet and Society</h3>
<p>Why learn about how the Internet works? As Vint Cerf Says: “You can’t escape from contact with the Internet.  So why not get to know it?” But you don’t have to take Vint Cerf’s word.  Some of the largest issues facing society hinge on an understanding of how the Internet functions.</p>
<p><strong>At the end of this unit you will do a Practice PT</strong> about one of these societal issues.  You will research one of these modern issues and prepare a flash talk (a 2 minute presentation) that explains the technical aspects of the Internet that underlie that issue.  As you go through these lessons keep you ears and eyes open for how things work.</p>
<p>Many of the issues are related to people taking advantage of the open protocols that make the internet function and present us with tricky dilemmas. </p>
<div class="admonition content">
<p class="admonition-title" id="content_None"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-education"></i>Content Corner</p>
<div>
<p><strong>More Examples and reasons to learn how the Internet functions:</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>The people who propose the laws, or judge them often don’t really know how the Internet works, what makes sense and what doesn’t. (See: The Internet is a series of tubes).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Citizens don’t know how to protect themselves from cybercrime, or often live in a cloud of fear and uncertainty not only about the law, but their rights, and about what’s actually technically possible.  </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Hackers take advantage of unknowing, unsuspecting people.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Corporations who provide Internet service need to balance profitability with providing access to everyone.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Countries restrict access to the internet or monitors activity - how is that technically possible? What is it they are actually doing?</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>For example there are two major issues to think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Net Neutrality</strong> is a raging legal debate about the principle that Internet service providers should enable access to all content and applications regardless of the source, and without favoring or blocking particular products or websites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Internet Censorship</strong> is the attempt to control or suppress of what can be accessed, published, or viewed on the Internet by certain people.  This can be used to protect people (i.e. to not allow access to child pornography) but can also be used to limit free speech.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To have an informed opinion though it helps to understand the technical underpinnings of how the internet works. </p>
<p>Finally, a major issue that our society faces is that far too few people actually understand how the Internet works!  We are going to change that over the next few lessons.</p>
