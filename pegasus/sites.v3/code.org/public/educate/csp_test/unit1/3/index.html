            <h2>Overview</h2>
            
                <p>Students are introduced to the Internet Simulator, a tool they will return to many times in the first two units of the course. Today, the Internet Simulator will be used to simulate a single shared wire, connecting two people.  The wire can only be in one of two possible states (state A or state B) and either partner may set or read the state of the wire at any time, but this is the only way in which students may communicate.  Students must invent a binary call-response <span class="vocab" title="Protocol: A set of rules governing the exchange or transmission of data between devices.">protocol</span> using this system. Coordination, speed and timing are problems that need to be solved. At the conclusion of the lesson, students compete to demonstrate the speed and accuracy of their protocols, and calculate the <span class="vocab" title="Bit rate: (sometimes written bitrate) the number of bits that are conveyed or processed per unit of time. e.g. 8 bits/sec.">bit rate</span> of their message exchange.</p>
            

            
                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                
                    <p>The major purpose of this lesson is to engage students in a rather challenging problem of engineering a physical network for digital communications. if you must communicate in binary by setting the state of some object (such as a wire) to one of its two possible states, merely defining “State A” and “State B” is insufficient because there is no way to distinguish between a single bit “A” and a string of “AAA” for example. Some element of time must be incorporated into a communication <span class="vocab" title="Protocol: A set of rules governing the exchange or transmission of data between devices.">protocol</span> to make it functional for exchanging bits. This time-per-bit leads naturally to calculating a <span>bitrate</span> for a given device, or a measure of how quickly a system transmits digital data.</p>
<p>This is the first lesson in which we use the Internet Simulator.  The Internet Simulator is a robust learning tool developed by Code.org specifically for Computer Science Principles, that has many different variants that you will see in the first two units of the course. It was designed to give students a hands-on experience experimenting with (and solving) different kinds of problems associated with networked computers and the Internet.  A goal of using the internet simulator was put best by a student near the conclusion of Unit 1 who said “Whoa, I feel like I just invented the Internet!”</p>

<p>The word “<span class="vocab" title="Protocol: A set of rules governing the exchange or transmission of data between devices.">protocol</span>” has a variety of meanings outside of computing.  It typically refers to a formal procedure or set of rules.  In computing a protocol usually implies a “communication protocol” that governs how devices should transmit and interpret data.  There are many similarities between <span class="vocab" title="Protocol: A set of rules governing the exchange or transmission of data between devices.">protocol</span>s and <span class="vocab" title="Algorithm: A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.">algorithm</span>s that can be made later in the course.</p>

<p>The following demonstration can be done in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Teacher use a flashlight </li>
<li>Use this presentation <a class="resource" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kOIhYEoeIg3YvkdYCgM6XElCmQyzegEQulKYMUrzYFU/edit#slide=id.g12976fcfcc_0_45" target="_blank">Flashlight Binary Signal Test</a> which has animations that simulate the flashlight.</li>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<p><em>“Imagine that you and your friend have made a binary signaling protocol using a flashlight.  The light on is state A, off is state B.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Test 1</strong></p>
<p><em>“Your friend sends you this message.  What is being signaled here? Write down what you think the message is.”</em></p>

<div>
<p>Many students likely decoded the first message as <code>B A B A B</code> initially.  The second message might have more variants, but <code>BB A B A BB AA BB</code> is one possibility.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>As soon as they received the second message they may have updated their original answer to account for the implied timing they saw in the second message.  Depending on how fast you think you could interpret signal changes the first message could easily be <em>any number</em> of consecutive Bs and As.</p>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Pulse the flash light on and off at ~1 second intervals 4 times</li>
<li>Give students a few seconds write</li>

<div>
<p>This brief warm-up activity and discussion is meant to draw out two main points:</p>
</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>A flashlight turning on and off <em>truly</em> has only two states.  Many of the devices students made, even if they used flashlights, probably had at least a third “do nothing” state that was used to signal a break between As and Bs.  </li>
<li>When there are truly only two states, <strong>time</strong> and synchronization become huge factors and must be accounted for in a <span class="vocab" title="Protocol: A set of rules governing the exchange or transmission of data between devices.">protocol</span>.  </li>
</ol>

<p>
</p><div class="tiplink tiplink-discussion"><a href="#discussion_protocols"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-comment"></i></a></div>
<p></p>
<p>Lead a discussion that explores the assumptions made when decoding these messages, and more importantly, explores what information they would need in order to decode it. </p>
<ul>
<li>Did this new message make you think about your answer to the first question?  Do you want to change your answer to the first question?</li>
<li>What assumptions did you make in interpreting these messages?</li>
<li>Is this protocol specific enough to allow useful communication of a binary message? If not what information would need to be added to it?</li>

<h3 id="introduce-the-internet-simulator">Introduce the Internet Simulator.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Today we will be using the Internet Simulator to explore some of the challenges of sending bits on the Internet. </li>
<li>This tool simulates a single wire connecting two people who cannot otherwise see or speak to each other.</li>
<li>The major challenge is that <strong>the wire is SHARED</strong> between the two people.</li>
<li>At <em>any time either person</em> can <strong>set</strong> the wire to state A or state B.</li>
<li>At <em>any time either person</em> can <strong>read</strong> the wire to see which state it’s in</li>
<li>This means that you and your partner need to coordinate your actions carefully because you can easily squash your communications.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>challenge</strong> of today’s activity is to figure out a way to make this tool into a functioning two-way bit-sending device.</p>
<p><strong>Video Demonstration of the Widget:</strong> </p>
<p>Watch tutorial video: <a class="resource" href="https://youtu.be/Kn6Fd5uwZno" target="_blank">Internet Simulator - Part 1</a>   which covers how to:
 * join or connect with another classmate
 * set the state of the wire
 * read the wire.</p>
<p>You can show it to the whole class or students can watch it on the Code Studio stage for this lesson.</p>

<p>Students will likely need some time to connect with their partners and experiment with the interface of the Internet Simulator. Once they feel comfortable with the basics of the tool, they should proceed as a class through the challenges found in <a class="resource" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Oyfk9VC9ymoDTCG-Z5pC95zupRI4FBTttO2rqvCUlcs/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Coordination and Binary Messages</a>.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Tips for Teaching with the Internet Simulator</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Understanding the concept of the “shared wire” can be very challenging at first.  The bit-sending devices students created in the previous lessons and the tool they are using today function differently, and students will likely need help developing the appropriate mental model. </li>
<li>Students are setting the state of a wire but have no guarantee their partners will receive that message. </li>
<li>In fact it is very likely students will set the state of the wire and then read their own message. </li>
<li>Only through carefully coordinating when they set and get the state of the wire can students use this tool to communicate. </li>
<li>Highlight this difference to students and feel free to emphasize that coordination / timing is the goal of the activity.</li>
<li>A timer has been included in the widget to help coordinate timing. NOTE: the timer doesn’t get or set the wire - it’s just a pulse that students can follow to coordinate getting and setting. </li>
<li>Groups should be encouraged to reconvene to add to or modify their protocol in order to be able to coordinate this kind of call-and-response message.</li>

<li>Place students in pairs and send them to the Internet Simulator. </li>

</div>
<div>
<h3 id="the-2-bit-message-exchange-challenge">The 2-bit Message Exchange Challenge!</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Students will practice relaying a 2-bit sequence with their partners.  The <strong>goal</strong> is to exchange 2-bit messages (partner sends a 2-bit message, other partner sends a 2-bit message back) as quickly and accurately as possible. In other words, students are trying to get the fastest <span class="vocab" title="Bit rate: (sometimes written bitrate) the number of bits that are conveyed or processed per unit of time. e.g. 8 bits/sec.">bit rate</span> possible.</p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Each initial sender should be able to confirm that the message was received correctly and resent because the message that they have received is the same as the original.  </li>
<li>As students iterate and perfect their protocol, they should try to extend their protocol to send more bits or send them more quickly, while maintaining accuracy. When each group has a working protocol and has time to practice (~10 minutes), have an all-class showdown to see who can do it the fastest.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Rules for the Challenge:</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Student pairs can decide who sends first.</li>
<li>Teacher reveals sequence of bits to be sent. Partner A of each group may enter this sequence of bits into Internet Simulator but may not begin sending them.</li>
<li>Teacher will say “GO” and partners will exchange messages.</li>
<li>During the challenge students may not communicate with one another. (<strong>Note:</strong> feel free to put partners on opposite sides of a room or in separate rooms altogether.)</li>
<li>Students yell “STOP” once they have completed their exchange.</li>
<li>Teacher will verify that each partner received what the other sent by checking outgoing and incoming messages.</li>

<p>Students would be hard-pressed to achieve a bit rate much faster than 1 bit/sec in this activity.  You might think that, say, 1,000 bits/sec would be fast for a computer, but even typical household modems in the early 90s had bit rates higher than about 10,000 bits/sec.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>These days transmission rates are well in excess of millions of bits/sec (or Mbps - Megabits per second).  Typical mobile phone speeds range from 5-10 Megabits per second,</p>

<li>A major focus of today’s activity was timing and coordination. What things did you need to coordinate or agree about ahead of time in order for your <span class="vocab" title="Protocol: A set of rules governing the exchange or transmission of data between devices.">protocol</span> to work?</li>

<li>Don’t allow partners to decide who goes first ahead of time.  Set up the challenge so that one partner could send a message to the other at any time and must verify that the partner is there and listening first.</li>
<li>Continue to increase the number of bits that students must be able to transmit in the challenge and showdown.</li>
<li>Require students to relay a message, but the response must be sent backwards.  This ensures partner B must receive the entire message before responding. (e.g. if partner A sends: ABAB partner B should respond: BABA.)</li>
