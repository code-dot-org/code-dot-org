            <h2>Overview</h2>
            
                <p>To conclude Unit 1, students will develop their own encoding for a personal experience (such as attending a party, playing a game, etc). The project begins with students doing some Top-Down Design to figure out the components and subcomponents of an experience that are encodable as binary information. Students then select a portion of the experience to flesh out into a full protocol.  The project concludes with reflection questions similar to those students will see on the AP Performance Tasks. While students will complete this project individually, they will exchange feedback with a classmate at one point of the project.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is NOT the official AP® Performance Task that will be submitted as part of the Advanced Placement exam; it is a practice activity intended to prepare students for some portions of their individual performance at a later time.</p>
            

            
                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                
                    <p>Abstraction is the practice of temporarily ignoring details to focus only on the most significant or relevant portions of a problem. In the instance of binary information, we know that underlying even complex data structures is just a sequence of bits. In most instances, however, we speak of these representations as a collection of numbers, text, images, and other means of interpreting these bits, which are more useful for the level of detail at which we typically operate. The ability to rely on high-level encodings and temporarily ignore lower-level details is the key to building the complex systems that we use and interact with every day. The ability to build and interact with these abstractions is one of the key tools of a computer scientist.</p>

                    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Explicitly introduce the term “abstraction” (see paragraph below), and frame the coming project as an opportunity for students to develop their own layers of abstraction.</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> Throughout this unit, we have been building layers of encodings on top of the foundation of bits. First we learned to develop binary numbers, then ASCII text, then formatted text, and finally color images. High-level encodings are actually quite removed from the underlying bits from which they are made.  In the world of computer science, we call this <strong>abstraction</strong> - a mental tool that allows us to ignore low-level details when they are unnecessary. This ability to ignore small details is what allows us to develop complex encodings and protocols. For example, the encoding for an image doesn’t need to know that the RGB values in each pixel are actually 8-bit numbers, and an encoding for formatted text does not care how the ASCII symbols that comprise it are actually represented. As long as there is some way to encode numbers and characters, these high-level encodings will function.</p>
<p>For the project we are beginning today, you are going to apply this idea of abstraction as you set out to build your own encoding and layers of abstraction.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Teaching Tips</p>
<p>This project serves multiple purposes. It concludes the first unit of study on encoding information and allows students to review and synthesize the material covered.  It provides practice for the performance tasks students will need to complete at the end of the year. Finally it serves as an opportunity for students to use computer science as an avenue to explore and express their own interests and passions. Encourage students to have some fun with their selections, and try to make them a means of self-expression. The limits of what students can choose to encode are, quite literally, defined only by their imaginations!</p>

                    <h2>Activity</h2>
                    <p>A proposed schedule of the steps of this project is included below, as well as more thorough explanations of how to conduct the various stages.</p>
<p><strong>Day 1</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Review Project Guidelines and Rubric.</li>
<li>Step 0: Choose the experience to encode: Brainstorm ideas.</li>
<li>Step 1: Break down the topic – Create the top-down diagram of the experience chosen.</li>
<li>Step 2: Consult a peer – Present ideas and provide feedback to each other on progress thus far.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Day 2</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Step 3: Develop a detailed encoding – of a portion of the diagram.</li>
<li>Finalize Your Encoding.</li>
<li>Respond to reflection Questions: Write required descriptions of encoding and complete reflection questions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="distribute-activity-guide">Distribute Activity Guide.</h3>
<p>Distribute copies of <a href="Encode an Experience" target="_blank">Activity Guide - Encode an Experience</a> to students and review as a class. You may wish to read through the guidelines of the project together. Alternatively, consider distributing the project guide earlier in the unit to provide students an opportunity to preview and prepare. In either case, this project is more substantial than those completed thus far in the course; students will need time to understand the extent of the project and expectations for their final product.</p>
<h3 id="choose-a-peer-reviewer">Choose a Peer Reviewer.</h3>
<p>While the project will be completed individually, students will be consulting a peer reviewer during the process to receive feedback and brainstorm ideas. Either assign pairs or allow students to pick their own.</p>
<h3 id="select-an-experience-to-encode">Select an Experience to Encode.</h3>
<p>Provide students with time to develop a topic of their encoding. Encourage them to pick something they really like, are interested in, or know a lot about. The most important thing is to pick a category of experience rather than a single instance.  For example, “taking a trip to the grand canyon” is better than “that time I went to the grand canyon”.  You might need to encourage or remind students that ultimately we’re trying to figure out if there is a way to encode this kind of experience in such a way that it could be represented in a computer.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Teaching Tips</p>
<p>If students are having difficulty developing their encoding, encourage them to talk with their peer reviewer. Develop the expectation that prior to asking you for help, students will have consulted one another.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="peer-consultation">Peer Consultation.</h3>
<p>After students have outlined their encoding, they should meet with their peer reviewers, present their work so far, and provide feedback regarding their progress. Potential Questions to address:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you think this experience is a good choice? Why or why not?</li>
<li>Have I identified the basic elements correctly? Did I miss any?</li>
<li>Do you think I will be able to encode this data? What challenges do you think I will have?</li>
<li>Do you have any suggestions for the next steps?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="create-your-encoding">Create Your Encoding.</h3>
<p>Students incorporate feedback from their peer reviewer to develop their encoding. This project can be completed entirely digitally, but if students will be visually arranging their tables on a poster, they should be given access to needed supplies.</p>
<h3 id="finalize-and-individual-reflections">Finalize and Individual Reflections.</h3>
<p>Provide students with time to finalize their encoding protocol, write their encoding description, and respond to the reflection questions. Communicate to students how they will be submitting their projects and ensure they have the tools necessary to produce and submit their projects.</p>

            <div class="activity">
                
                    <h2>Wrap-up</h2>
                    <p><strong>Self-assess:</strong> It can be a useful exercise to have students briefly assess themselves using the rubric they were provided at the beginning of the project. Ask them to identify points where they could improve, and remind them that this rubric is very similar in structure to the one that will be used on the actual AP Performance Tasks they will see later in the year.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Teaching Tips</p>
<p><strong>Gallery Walk:</strong> If students create visual representations of their encodings, then you may want to provide time to present their work to their classmates in a gallery walk. Students should hopefully appreciate the diversity of interests and encodings created.</p>
<p>Feel free to exclude the wrap-up activity in the interest of time. Neither is an essential portion of the Performance Tasks and they are included only to provide a more natural conclusion to the project within your class.</p>
