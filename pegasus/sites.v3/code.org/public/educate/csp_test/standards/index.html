    <meta name="description" content="What is CS Principles?The College Board has proposed a new course called AP® Computer Science Principles. This course is designed to be far more than a traditional introduction to programming - it is a rigorous, engaging, and approachable course that explores many of the big, foundational ideas of computing so that all students understand how these concepts are transforming the world we live in. The official AP® exam is set to go live in the 2016-17 school year with an exam and performance-based assessments.">
