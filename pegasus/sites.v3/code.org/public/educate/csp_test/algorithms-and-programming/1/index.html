            <h2>Overview</h2>
            
                <p>Students quickly recall the meaning of the word “algorithm” before moving into the day’s activity, building a small arrangement of LEGO® blocks and then creating text instructions a classmate could follow to construct the same arrangement. Groups will then trade instructions to see if they were clear enough to allow reconstruction of the original arrangement. The wrap-up discussion is used to highlight the inherent ambiguities of human language and call out the need for the creation of a programming language which leaves no room for interpretation. The lesson concludes with a video that encourages students to learn to program in order to extend their problem-solving capabilities.</p>
            

            
                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                
                    <p>Programming languages are fundamentally different from the human languages we use every day. Programming languages are purpose-built to provide clear instructions and overcome the ambiguities of human language. In every instance, there should be only one way to interpret a command which results in a single, repeatable outcome. Since programming languages are used to provide clear instructions for completing a task, they may also be thought of as the languages of algorithms. The earliest programming languages were designed to program mechanical machines and computers, and they were typically written by punching holes in cards. Over time, human-readable programming languages have been developed, allowing for a more natural expression of algorithms. Today there are hundreds of programming languages a programmer can choose from, depending on both the requirements of the task at hand and personal preference.</p>

        <h1>Teaching Guide</h1>

        
            <div class="activity">
                
                    <h2>Getting Started (5 mins)</h2>
                    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Establish a shared definition of an algorithm in order to frame the day’s activity as an exercise in expressing an algorithm clearly. Don’t worry about rigorously defining it here, as this is merely a framing exercise. Move students into the activity quickly and use the subsequent discussion and video as sense-making tools.</p>
<p><strong>Thinking Prompt:</strong> “In this class, we have already seen the word ‘algorithm’ many times. Remind me what an algorithm is and reflect on why we might want to create algorithms for a task from our daily lives.”</p>
<p><strong>Discuss:</strong> Give students a minute to quickly share with a neighbor and then allow some students to share ideas with the whole class. Many responses are possible, but the core ideas are:</p>
<ul>
<li>An algorithm is a set of steps or instructions that can be followed to complete a task.</li>
<li>If we can express a task as an algorithm, then we can give those instructions to someone else (or a computer) to take care of that task for us.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Transition:</strong> An algorithm is a set of steps or instructions that someone could follow to complete a task. In this class we’re going to be thinking more about creating algorithms that a computer could follow, but for now let’s focus on creating algorithms for one another.</p>
                
            </div>
        
            <div class="activity">
                
                    <h2>Activity (25 mins)</h2>
                    <p><strong>Distribute:</strong> This activity can be completed with the <a href="LEGO Algorithms" target="_blank">Activity Guide - LEGO Algorithms</a> (or <a href="Building Blocks of Drawing" target="_blank">Activity Guide - Building Blocks of Drawing</a>, if not using LEGO blocks), or students can record their instructions on a plain sheet of paper, poster paper, piece of construction paper, etc. Students may work alone or in groups of 2 or 3. Each group should be given 5-6 LEGO® blocks.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title" id="tip_None"><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i>Teaching Tips</p>
<div></div>
<div>
<p>To make things interesting, strike a balance between all blocks being different colors and all blocks being the same. This forces students to be precise in identifying which block should be used in each step.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3 id="create-a-simple-lego-arrangement">Create a simple LEGO arrangement.</h3>
<p>Groups should create an arrangement of their blocks in accordance with the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>All pieces must be connected in a single arrangement.</li>
<li>Color matters: the final arrangement must be absolutely identical to the original.</li>
<li>Groups should record their arrangement by taking a picture or creating a simple drawing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="create-an-algorithm-for-building-your-arrangement">Create an algorithm for building your arrangement.</h3>
<p>On a separate sheet of paper, each group should write out a an algorithm, or a set of instructions, that another group could use to create the same arrangement. A couple of guidelines are below:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may only use words when creating these instructions. In particular, you may not include your image or draw images of your own.</li>
<li>Try to make your instructions as clear as possible. Your classmates are about to use them!
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="trade-instructions-and-attempt-to-follow-them">Trade instructions and attempt to follow them.</h3>
<p>Groups should disassemble their arrangements, place their instructions next to the pieces, and hide their image or drawing of the arrangement somewhere it cannot be seen. Have groups move around the room to other groups’ instructions and try to follow them to build the desired arrangements. Have the original group check whether the solutions are correct or let groups check their solutions themselves by looking at the recorded image of the arrangement afterwards. Allow groups an opportunity to try a few of their classmates’ instructions before reconvening.</p>
                
            </div>
        
            <div class="activity">
                
                    <h2>Wrap-up (20 mins)</h2>
                    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Highlight the fact that ambiguity in human language led to issues or at least difficulty in creating the arrangements. Use this experience to motivate the need to create a well-defined set of commands that all parties can agree upon for expressing the steps of a task, or in other words, a programming language. Reflect upon the challenges working in such a rigorously defined language might present, and build excitement for the coming unit with the concluding video.</p>
<p><strong>Reflect:</strong> Bring the class back together to reflect upon the following prompts or similar ones of your own creation. You may wish for students to record their answers in writing. <em>Prompts:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Were you always able to create the intended arrangement? Were your instructions as clear as you thought?</li>
<li>Why do you think we are running into these miscommunications? Is it really the fault of your classmates or is something else going on?</li>
</ul>
<p>In the discussion of these prompts, ask students to mention instances where language was ambiguous or detail was not as great as students thought. Establish the fact that even when we are very careful, the very nature of human language means there is typically some room for interpretation. In day-to-day life that’s fine, but when expressing algorithms we need to do better.</p>
<p><strong>Brainstorm:</strong> Transition the conversation to a more proactive response to the day’s activity. Ask students to brainstorm ways to overcome the ambiguity of human language. <em>Prompt:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>If we were going to change human language to improve our odds of succeeding at this activity, what types of changes would we need to make?</li>
</ul>
<p>Let students discuss at tables before again sharing with the class. Key ideas to bring out are:</p>
<ul>
<li>So long as there are multiple ways to interpret language, we cannot have perfect precision.</li>
<li>If we rigorously define the meaning of each command we use, then we can avoid misinterpretation and confidently express algorithms.</li>
<li>This is different from the way we normally think and talk, and it might even take a while to get comfortable with communicating in this way.</li>

<p>Students may say things like “We could be really careful about our language” or “We could include more detail.”  These are entirely true, but emphasize that if there’s room for interpretation then we can’t be certain about our results.  Move towards the solution of creating a new language (a programming language!) in which we have strictly and precisely defined exactly what every word means. This is different from our normal human language, but necessary if we want perfect clarity in expressing instructions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Transition:</strong> Today we saw how human language may not always be precise enough to express algorithms, even for something as simple as building a small LEGO arrangement. The improvements you have suggested actually create a new kind of language for expressing algorithms, which we as computer scientists call a programming language. In the coming unit we are going to learn a lot more about how we can use programming languages to express our ideas as algorithms, build new things, and solve problems.</p>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> Conclude class by building excitement about learning to program by showing this video. It describes the kinds of problems that programming can be used to solve and makes the case for learning to program to solve those problems. <a class="resource" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfBWk4nw440" target="_blank">You Should Learn to Program: Christian Genco at TEDxSMU</a> </p>

                    <p>Ask students to rigorously define a small set of commands that could be used to build any arrangement of LEGO blocks. For example: “rotate”, “attach”, “detach”, “move”, etc. Feel free to let students select their own and then test out their new and more precise set of commands by repeating today’s activity using them.</p>

<li>Consider the algorithm you designed for today’s activity. Identify two instances where there may be multiple ways to interpret your instructions and suggest improvements that could be made to improve their clarity.</li>
<li>Describe the features of a programming language that make it different from the language you are used to using in everyday life. Explain why a programming language must be created in this way.</li>
