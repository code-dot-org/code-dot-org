Students begin the lesson by comparing the size of a plain text file containing “hello” to a Word document with the same contents. Students are introduced to the units kilobyte, megabyte, gigabyte, and terabyte, and research the sizes of files they make use of every day, using the appropriate terminology. This lesson foreshadows an investigation of compression as a means for combatting the rapid growth of digital data.</span>

                            <span class="lesson_desc">In this lesson, students will begin to explore the way digital images are encoded in binary. The class begins by asking students to invent their own image encoding protocol in order to familiarize themselves with some of the subtle complications of encoding images, namely the need for other data, called metadata, that describes properties of the image necessary for rendering it. Students will learn about pixels, raster images, and what an image file format is.  Students will encode binary image data using a widget in Code Studio.</span>

                            <span class="lesson_desc">In this lesson students are asked to consider how color is represented on a computer and to imagine how it might be encoded in binary.  Students then learn about how color is actually represented on a computer - using the RGB color scheme - and create their own images in an new version of the pixelation widget that allows you use more than 1 bit per pixel to represent color information.  After grappling with the prospect of possibly many bits just to represent a single pixel, students are shown how using hexadecimal allows us to represent many bits with fewer characters.  Students use a new version of the pixelation tool to encode an image with color and create a personal favicon.</span>

The lesson begins with students exploring a mock “lossy” text compression scheme as a way to learn about “lossy” compression.  Then we do a jigsaw “rapid research” activity in which pairs of student research a real image, text, or sound encoding file format and determine what kind of compression it uses and the theory behind it. This lesson also sets the stage for the practice Performance Task (Encode a Complex Thing) that follows this lesson.</span>

The project begins with students doing some top-down design to figure out the components and subcomponents of an experience that are encodable as binary information. Students then select a portion of the experience to flesh out into a a more detailed design.  The project includes a written reflection questions similar to those students will see on the AP Performance Tasks.

To begin the lesson, students will take a short online quiz that supposedly determines something interesting or funny about their personality. Afterwards they will brainstorm other sources of data in the world around them, leading to a discussion of how that data is collected. This discussion motivates the introduction of the Class Data Tracker project that will run through the first half of this unit. Students will take the survey for the first time and be shown what the results will look like. To close the class, students will make predictions of what they will find when all the data has been collected in a couple weeks.</span>

                            <span class="lesson_desc">This lesson asks students to consider carefully the assumptions they make when interpreting data and data visualizations. The class begins by examining how the Google Flu Trends project tried and failed to use search trends to predict flu outbreaks. They will then read a report on the Digital Divide which highlights how access to technology differs widely by personal characteristics like race and income. This report challenges a widespread assumption that data collected online is representative of the population at large. To practice identifying assumptions in data analysis, students are provided a series of scenarios in which data-driven decisions are made based on flawed assumptions. They will need to identify the assumptions being made (most notably those related to the digital divide) and explain why these assumptions lead to incorrect conclusions.</span>

As our world is increasingly filled with data, more and more the information from that data is conveyed through visualizations. Visualization is useful for both discovery of connections and trends and also communication.  In this lesson we will focus on the communication aspects of visualization.  </span>

This lesson teaches students how to build visualizations from provided datasets. The levels in Code Studio provide a detailed walkthrough of how to use Google Sheets to create several different kinds of charts. While this lesson focuses on the Google Sheets tool, other tools may be substituted at the teacher’s discretion, and MS Excel support is coming soon to the lesson.</span>
