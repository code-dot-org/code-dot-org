            <h2>Overview</h2>
            
                <p>Public key encryption is what makes all security on the Internet possible.  In this lesson, students learn about some of the mathematical foundations that make this possible, namely the modulo operation, which is an important concept in many areas of computer science and an essential ingredient in modern cryptography.  Students first understand modulo as “clock arithmetic” and experiment with the “Modulo Clock” in a widget.  After seeing how modulo can be used as a one-way function, students follow a very similar procedure to the “cups and beans” activity from the prior lesson, this time using multiplication and modulo to form the asymmetric keys that Alice and Bob use to exchange information in public.  The mathematics and steps of the process are aided by the Public Key Crypto widget.</p>
            

            
                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                
                    <p>The modulo operation (which gives you the remainder of dividing two integers) is important in computer science because it turns out to be useful in many contexts.  It’s actually not computationally intensive to compute a single modulo on a computer; it’s as fast as adding two numbers.  For example, modulo can be used to quickly determine whether a number is even or odd ( ___ MOD 2 = 0 or 1).</p>
<p>The commutative properties of modulo and numbers with large exponents were discovered to be the key ingredients for modern day asymmetric encryption. The widget in the lesson mimics the RSA encryption algorithm (with smaller numbers and slightly easier mathematics).  Public key cryptography - in which two parties can send encrypted messages without establishing a shared private key - is what allows for secure transactions on the Internet.</p>

                    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                    <p><strong>Recall</strong> (optional if unnecessary to review):
So far we’ve done a fair amount of hand waving and using pictures of graphs to explain one-way functions.  Then we used cups and beans as a metaphor for a one-way function to demonstrate how asymmetric encryption works, using one key to encrypt a message and different key to decrypt the message.</p>
<p>Asymmetric encryption allows for two parties to send secret messages to each other over public channels without having to agree on a secret encryption key ahead of time.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Teaching Tips</p>
<p>It might seem like this getting started activity would take longer than 5 minutes because of the amount of text here, but it can go very quickly.  As long as students get the concept, they will be ready to move into the first part of the activity.</p>
</div>
<p>Today we’ll see how encryption is really done using numbers and (gasp) math. To see how it works, we have to learn about a real one-way function first, one that uses numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Thought experiment:</strong> </p>
<p><img alt="" class="right" src="https://code.org/educate/docs/csp/U2L19-clocks.png"> Imagine that you are the kind of person who, when you close your eyes, you lose complete track of time.  When you open your eyes, a minute could have passed or an hour…or a day…or a week…or a year…you don’t know. </p>
<p>So, now imagine a clock that reads 4:00.<br>
Note: Show a clock of some kind; here is an <a href="http://www.visnos.com/demos/clock" target="_blank">interactive one</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Prompt:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Now close your eyes and I’m going to add some time to the clock - I’m going to simulate that some amount of time is passing.  Remember, with your eyes closed, any amount of time could be going by. 
Move clock to show 3:00.</li>
<li>Now open your eyes, look at the clock and, without saying anything to anyone, write down how much time has passed. 
Wait a few seconds for students to write.</li>
<li>So, how much time passed? What are the possibilities? 
There is an infinite number of possibilities, including: 11 hours, 23, 35, 47 hours, etc.  Or 1 day and 11 hours, and so on.</li>
<li>If students want to know what you were thinking, make up something that no one has said yet, something like, “Oh, I was actually imagining that I was adding 13 years, 47 days and 11 hours.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Clock as a one-way function:</strong></p>
<p>So a clock represents a one-way function!  (For simplicity, let’s just say we’re only talking about the hour hand on the clock.)  No matter what number you put into it, since only numbers 1-12 can show, the only answer you’re going to get is 1-12.  We say that any number “wraps around the clock.”  Even if the number is 2,023,789 hours, if you wind the clock around, it will still come out as a number 1-12.  This means that from the clock face alone, we cannot work backwards; we cannot know what the original number was that went into the clock.</p>

<h3 id="part-1-experiment-with-the-modulo-clock-10-mins">Part 1. Experiment with the Modulo Clock - 10 mins</h3>
<p>First, we’re going to experiment a little bit with this kind of “clock arithmetic”.</p>
<p>Distribute: <a href="Public Key Cryptography" target="_blank">Activity Guide - Public Key Cryptography</a> (Students may also find a link on Code Studio.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask students to read and do what is explained on <strong>page 1</strong> of the activity guide.</li>
<li>Putting students into pairs for the first part of the activity is recommended.</li>
<li>The activity guide directs students to the <a class="resource" href="https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/hCEJDg_MsULeilvyoikF4g" target="_blank">Public Key Crypto Widget</a>.<ul>
<li>Students should ONLY be experimenting with the “Modulo Clock” at this point; a screen capture is shown at right.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make sure students <strong>read</strong> the description of terminology at the bottom of the first page of the activity guide.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Discuss and Recap:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ask a student or pair to explain what the Modulo Clock does.<ul>
<li>Short version: You can set how many “ticks” are on the clock (the “clock size”) and then you can type in any number, and the visualization shows the number “wrapping around” the clock to arrive at the final result.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make sure students understand the terms at the bottom of the first page.<ul>
<li>“modulus” = “clock size”</li>
<li>“modulo” = “mod” =  the official name for the operation of wrapping a number around the clock.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="part-2-using-modulo-for-asymmetric-encryption-20-mins">Part 2: Using modulo for asymmetric encryption - 20 mins</h3>
<p><strong>Transition:</strong> We can use modulo as a one-way function for encryption, too.  A weakness of the cups and beans was that we were actually sending the real numbers we intended to use through Eve, and we had to pretend that Eve couldn’t count them.  Now we’re going to re-enact the asymmetric encryption procedure we did with cups and beans, but we’re going to use multiplication and modulo to create our keys and secret messages.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Put students into groups of three, one each to play Alice, Bob and Eve. (Doubling up on a character is fine.)</li>
<li>Have students follow the instructions for the Public Key Encryption Procedure which starts on Page 2.</li>
<li>Students should send an encrypted message a few times, using different values and possibly playing different roles.</li>
<li>Make sure to leave time for students to read the last section about the key take-aways from the activity.</li>

<p>The encryption procedure does not take very long at all to execute once you get it down.  If students have time, you can suggest or do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have students send a real message by encrypting ASCII codes for letters of the alphabet.</li>
<li>The widget will let one person play all 3 roles, switching back and forth.  Have students really study the procedure and prove to themselves that messages are hard for Eve to crack.</li>
<li>Have the team of 3 prove to themselves what it takes to crack a message.  Start with small clock sizes to guess the private key, and then make them increasingly large.</li>
<li><strong>Here’s a fun one:</strong> Have two students play Alice and Bob and have everyone else in the class play Eve and try to crack the messages that Bob and Alice send to each other.</li>
<li>If students are interested in how the math works for the widget and in real encryption, you can give them the <a href="How and Why Does the Public Key Crypto Really Work?" target="_blank">Resource - How and Why Does the Public Key Crypto Really Work?</a></li>

                    <h2>Wrap-up</h2>
                    <p><strong>Review</strong> the key points about public key encryption that are at the end of the activity guide.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cryptography has a mathematical foundation</li>
<li>It relies on asymmetric keys which you can make using numbers and math</li>
<li>The modulo operation acts as a one-way function</li>
<li>When you multiply big numbers and mod them by other big numbers, it’s really hard to figure out what the original numbers were – essentially reduced to random guessing.</li>
<li>The security of publicly known encryption protocols is based on the fact that cracking a message by brute force would take an unreasonable amount of time. </li>
<li>With a sufficiently large modulus (say, 256 bits which would be a roughly 77-digit number) random guessing would take an unreasonable amount of time.  Even if you had millions of computers working on it constantly it would take trillions of years.  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Question:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Why is Public Key Encryption so important?  Why are we making such a big deal about it?  <strong>What does public key encryption allow us to do that other encryption schemes don’t?  In other words: If I can send secret messages to someone without having to establish a secret key ahead of time, what is possible that otherwise isn’t?</strong> <ul>
<li>Have students respond with various ideas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Public key encryption is what makes all security on the Internet possible. It’s what allows us to send credit card information securely to buy something.  It’s what allows us to log into websites securely; since we have to send our passwords over the Internet to login, even passwords are themselves encrypted.</li>
<li>It also allows us to prevent ourselves from being spied on or hacked, if we’re careful.</li>
<li>Until asymmetric encryption was invented, the only way to ensure secure transactions on the Internet was to establish a shared private key, or to use a third party to guarantee security.</li>
<li>In the history of the Internet, the creation of public key cryptography is one of the most significant innovations; without it we could not do much of what we take for granted today.</li>
<li>Because the method of encryption is public, it actually increases the security, because good guys and bad guys know how hard it is to crack.  </li>
