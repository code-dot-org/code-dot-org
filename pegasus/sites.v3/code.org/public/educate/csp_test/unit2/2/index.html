            <h2>Overview</h2>
            
                <p>At some point we reach a physical limit of how fast we can send bits and if we want to send a large amount of information faster, we have to find a way to represent the same information with fewer bits - we must <strong>compress</strong> the data.  </p>
<p>In this lesson, students will use the Text Compression Widget to compress segments of English text by looking for patterns and substituting symbols for larger patterns of text.  After some experimentation students are asked to come up with a process (or algorithm) for arriving at a “good” amount of compression despite the fact that there is no way to know what is best or optimal.  In developing a so-called “<span class="vocab" title="Heuristic: a problem solving approach (algorithm) to find a satisfactory solution where finding an optimal or exact solution is impractical or impossible.">heuristic</span> approach” to this problem, students will grapple with the tradeoffs in compressing data and begin to develop a sense of computing problems that are “hard” to solve.</p>
            

            
                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                
                    <p>This is a big lesson that covers a lot of bases.  It should easily take 2 or more days of class.  First and foremost it covers two or three topics directly from the CSP framework.</p>
<p><strong>1. <span class="vocab" title="Lossless Compression: a data compression algorithm that allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data.">lossless compression</span></strong></p>
<p>The basic principle behind compression is to develop a method or protocol for using fewer bits to represent the original information. The way we represent compressed data in this lesson, with a “dictionary” of repeated patterns is similar to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Welch" target="_blank">LZW compression scheme</a>, but it should be noted that LZW is slightly different from what students do in this lesson.  Students invent their own way here.  LZW is used not only for text (zip files), but also with the GIF image file format.</p>
<p><strong>2. <span class="vocab" title="Heuristic: a problem solving approach (algorithm) to find a satisfactory solution where finding an optimal or exact solution is impractical or impossible.">heuristic</span>s</strong> </p>
<p>The lesson touches on computationally hard problems and heuristics but please note that <strong>computationally hard problems and heuristics will be revisited later on</strong>.  A general “hand-wavy” understanding is all that’s needed from this lesson.  </p>
<p>We do want students to see, however, that there is no single correct way to compress text using the method we use in this lesson because a) there is no known algorithm for finding an optimal solution, and b) we don’t even know a way to verify whether a given solution is optimal. There is no way to prove it or derive it beyond trying all possibilities by brute force.  <strong>This is an example of an algorithm that cannot run in a “reasonable amount of time”</strong> - one of the CSP learning objectives.</p>
<p><strong>3. Foreshadowing programming behaviors</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, the Text Compression Activity is an <strong>important lesson to refer back to when students start programming.</strong>   The activity engages students in thinking and problem solving behaviors that foreshadow skills that are particularly useful for programming later down the line.  In particular, when students recognize patterns that repeat, and then represent those patterns as abstract symbols, and then further recognize patterns within those patterns, it is very similar to the kinds of abstractions we develop when writing <strong>functions and procedures when programming</strong>.   Decoding the message in the warm-up activity is very similar to tracing a sequence of function calls in a program.</p>

<div></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Today’s class is about <strong>compression</strong></li>
<li>When you abbreviate or use coded language to shorten the original text, you are “compressing text.”  Computers do this too, <strong>in order to save time and space.</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>The art and science of compression is about figuring out how to represent the SAME DATA with FEWER BITS.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Why is this important? One reason is that storage space is limited and you’d always prefer to use fewer bits if you could.  A much more compelling reason is that there is an upper limit to how fast bits can be transmitted over the Internet.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>What if we need to send a large amount of text faster over the Internet, but we’ve reached the physical limit of how fast we can send bits?  Our only choice is to somehow capture the same information with fewer bits; we call this <strong>compression</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p><strong>Recap: How much was it compressed?</strong></p>
<p>To answer, we need to compare the number of characters in the original poem to the number of characters needed to represent the compressed version. </p>
<p>Let’s break it down.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Display</strong> or <strong>Demonstrate</strong> yourself ideas from: <a class="resource" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z3kwOLtnzV-vFvNYVCI5CwJlqW7oMPHsmLEQNog-0jM" target="_blank">Activity Recap - Decode this Message</a> (shown in table above)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Important Note</strong>: </p>
<ul>
<li>The compressed poem is not <em>just</em> this part: <a data-lightbox="all_images" data-title="" href="https://code.org/educate/docs/csp/U2L02-pitterPatter-compressed.png"><img alt="" src="https://code.org/educate/docs/csp/U2L02-pitterPatter-compressed.png" style="width: 250px;"></a>  If you were to send this to someone over the Internet they would not be able to decode it.</li>
<li>The full compressed text includes BOTH the compressed text <em>and</em> the key to solve it.  </li>
<li>Thus, you must account for the total number of characters in the message <em>plus</em> the total number of characters in the key to see how much you’ve compressed it over the original.  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Teacher’s Choice</strong> whether to show the video to the whole class or let students watch it from within Code Studio.  There are benefits and drawbacks to each.</p>
</div>
<div>

</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Communication and Collaboration:</strong>  To develop communication and collaboration between students, include one of the following scenarios in class:</p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Have students who were assigned the same poem compare results, or seat them in the same area of the room.</li>
<li>Have a little friendly competition - but be careful not to let “bad” competition seep in - to see which pair can compress a poem the most.  Use a poem that none of the students have compressed yet.</li>
<li>For each poem, have the group(s) who did it figure out the best in the class, and record it on the board or somewhere that people can see.<ul>
<li>Have a class goal of getting the compression percentages for the four poems as high as possible.</li>
<li>The groups with the best compression percentages may be asked to share their strategy with the class.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p>Students may be reluctant to share if they feel they don’t have the best results, but students should see others’ work and offer advice and strategies.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><em>“What makes doing this compression hard?”</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Invite responses.  Some of these issues should surface:  You can start in lots of different ways.  Early choices affect later ones.  Once you find one set of patterns, others emerge.</li>
<li>There is a tipping point:  you might be making progress compressing, but at some point the scale tips and the dictionary starts to get so big that you lose the benefit of having it.  But then you might start re-thinking the dictionary to tweak some bits out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>“Do we think that these compression amounts that we’ve found are the the best? Is there a way to know what the best compression is?</em>“</p>
<ul>
<li>We probably don’t know what’s best.</li>
<li>There are so many possibilities it’s hard to know.  It turns out the only way to guarantee perfect compression is brute force.  This means trying every possible set of substitutions. Even for small texts this will take far too long. The “best” is really just the best we’ve found so far.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>“But is there a process a person can follow to find the best (or a pretty good) compression for a piece of text?</em>“</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, but it’s imprecise – you might leave this as a lingering question that leads to the next student task.</li>

<li>Some compression programs (like zip) do a great job if the file is sufficiently large and has reasonable amounts of repetition. </li>
<li>However, it is also possible to create a “compressed file” that is larger than the original because the heuristic does work in every single case.</li>

</div>
<p><strong>Zip Compression</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is a compression algorithm called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Welch" target="_blank">LZW compression</a> upon which the common “zip” utility is based.  Zip compression does something very similar to what you did today with the text compression widget.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here is an <a href="http://www.data-compression.com/lempelziv.shtml" target="_blank">animation of lzw in action.</a>  You can see the algorithm doesn’t compress it the most, but it is following a heuristic that will lead to better and better compression over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you want to use zip compression for real?  Most computers have it built in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Windows:</strong> select a file or group of files, right-click, and choose “Send To…Compressed (zipped) Folder.”</li>
<li><strong>Mac:</strong> select a file or group of files, ctrl+click, and choose “Compress Items.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Warning: if you try this results may vary.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Zip works <em>really</em> well for text, but only on large files.  If you try to compress the simple hello.txt file we used in a previous lesson, you’ll see the resulting file is actually <em>bigger</em>.</li>
<li>Zip is meant for text.  It might not work well on non-text files very well because they are already compressed or don’t have the same kinds of embedded patterns that text documents do.</li>

<li>Warning: results may vary.  Zip works really well for text, but it might not compress other files very well because they are already compressed or don’t have the same kinds of embedded patterns that text documents do.</li>

<p><strong>Challenge:  Research the LZW algorithm</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>.zip compression is based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Welch" target="_blank">LZW Compression Scheme</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the idea behind the text compression tool is similar to LZW (zip) algorithm, tracing the path of compression and decompression is somewhat challenging.  Learning more about LZW and what happens in the course of this algorithm would be an excellent extension project for some individuals.</p>

                    <h2>Assessment</h2>
                    <p><strong>Questions:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>If you send the compressed poem, would your friend will be able to read it?  Why is the dictionary important? <ul>
<li>Your friend would only be able to read it if she knew how it was encoded. The dictionary is necessary because it tells her how to decompress the information that she has. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why do you want to compress anything?  What’s the point?<ul>
<li>It is useful for sending things faster or for smaller storage.  It allows for optimization of limited resources. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For a piece of text, what is a “good” amount of compression?  Is there a way to know when you’ve compressed it the most?  Explain how you would know, or why you can’t know.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Case Study:</strong>  A simple message has been compressed below:</p>
<p><a data-lightbox="all_images" data-title="Compressed message" href="https://code.org/educate/docs/csp/U1L13-compressed-message.png"><img alt="Compressed message" class="center" src="https://code.org/educate/docs/csp/U1L13-compressed-message.png"></a></p>
<ul>
<li>What was the original message?<ul>
<li>the_big_bug_bit_the_bull_but_the_bull_bit_the_big_bug_back</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Approximately what was the percentage of compression?  (count bytes in original vs. total bytes in compressed version) <ul>
<li>approximately: 25% compression</li>
</ul>
