            <h2>Overview</h2>
            
                <p>This lesson introduces the concept of public key cryptography using the classic “Alice and Bob” scenario often taught in computer science classes. In this scenario, Alice and Bob are able to securely send messages to each other without having to come up with a shared secret key ahead of time. Students model this exchange using cups and beans, and send a “secret number” to a partner. Students learn that public key cryptography uses asymmetric encryption, which is why one key (the encryption key or “public key”) can be made completely public without compromising the security of encrypted messages.</p>
            

            
                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                
                    <p>Students have done encryption before, but those methods always required both parties knowing a secret key to encrypt and decrypt. A major problem that arises: how can two parties establish a secret key without meeting ahead of time?  If we can solve that problem, then we have a way for people (or computers) to establish keys over the Internet to enable secure transactions.
Public key cryptography does away with this problem by introducing asymmetric keys – that is, the key to encrypt (which is public) is NOT the same key used to decrypt (which is private). In this way, messages can be sent between people who have never met before, and these messages can be shared publicly with a reasonable expectation of security. 
In later lessons, students will learn to leverage computationally hard algorithms to make these messages essentially uncrackable.</p>

            <div class="activity">
                
                    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                    <p><strong>Recall:</strong> Think back to the Caesar cipher, random substitution cipher, and Vigenère cipher we saw in previous lessons. Each of these ciphers had something called a “key” that was used to encrypt and decrypt secret messages.  An eavesdropper who intercepted the message and didn’t have the key had to do a lot of work to crack the message or just guess what the key was.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is there a way to send an encrypted message over an insecure channel without establishing a key ahead of time in private?  </p>
<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Let’s do a thought experiment: Imagine that Bob wants to send Alice a message using the Vigenère cipher.  Alice and Bob haven’t met ahead of time or established any kind of shared secret.  Now imagine that Alice and Bob are far apart and have to rely on Eve, the eavesdropper, to deliver their messages to each other.  Assume that Eve won’t alter the messages when she delivers them, but she will try to spy.  Can you figure out a way for Bob to send Alice an encrypted message that only Alice can read?  </p>
<p>Have small groups or pairs discuss this problem for a few minutes and then ask if there are any solutions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher’s Note:</strong> There is no way to do this.  It’s likely that, at best, a group figured out a way to communicate a key by obscuring or hiding it in some fashion that still requires the recipient to know what to look for or to have some prior knowledge of what to do.</li>
<li>Hopefully, students encountered the never-ending cycle: In order to ensure the key is secure, we’d have to encrypt the key… with a secret key… that would have to be encrypted with a key…that would have to be encrypted with a key….and so on.</li>

                    <h2>Activity - 30 mins</h2>
                    <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> The problem of how to send encrypted messages without establishing keys in private ahead of time baffled cryptographers and computer scientists for years, but there is a way to do it!  In today’s activity, we will act out a way to send secret messages that does NOT rely on a shared secret key. </p>
<p>This method is called <strong>public key cryptography</strong> because the “key” needed to encrypt something is actually public, and can be used by anyone!  But that key cannot be used to decrypt.  It also relies on the existence of one-way functions that work similarly to the one we studied in the last lesson.  For today’s activity, we’re not going to encrypt and decrypt data.  Instead we’ll be using physical objects to represent data, one-way functions, encryption, and decryption. </p>
<p>Let’s try it out.</p>
<h3 id="a-metaphor-for-a-one-way-function">A metaphor for a one-way function.</h3>
<p>Have you ever been to a carnival or fair where there’s a big glass jar of candy (usually jelly beans) and you’re supposed to guess how much candy is in the jar? </p>
<p>Today this will be our metaphor for a <strong><em>one-way function</em></strong>: Imagine that a person can count out some number of candies, dump them in a glass jar, close the lid and put a lock on it.  Only that person knows how many candies there are in the jar, and only that person can open the jar.  </p>
<p>For anyone else, even though they can see the all the candy right there in the jar, it’s almost impossible to accurately count how many candies there are. If you do manage to figure it out, it’s probably just dumb luck!  So for today, we’ll say that guessing the number of candies in the jar is a <strong>computationally hard problem to solve</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Form groups of 3 for this activity - one each to play Alice, Bob and Eve.  It’s fine if some students double-up to play one of the characters.</li>
<li>Distribute the materials and copies of <a href="Public Key Bean Counting" target="_blank">Activity Guide - Public Key Bean Counting</a> to each group.</li>
<li>Let groups read the instructions and do the activity on their own.</li>
<li>After doing the information exchange with cups and beans a few times, have students read the <strong>“What’s the point?”</strong> page at the end of the activity guide.<ul>
<li>It contains “official” terminology for public key cryptography and relates it to the cups and beans activity.</li>

<p>Once students get into the activity, it may go very quickly.  Encourage students to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Repeat it playing different roles.</li>
<li>Try the 3-cup version.</li>
<li>After reading the “What’s the point” section of the activity guide, have students act out the information exchange procedure using the terminology of Public key, Private key, Encrypting and Decrypting.</li>

                    <h2>Wrap-up</h2>
                    <p><strong>Review:</strong>  <em>Say:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>This is a big deal:</strong> Public key cryptography is what makes secure transactions on the Internet possible.  Without it we couldn’t buy things, communicate without being spied on, use banks, or keep our own conduct on the Internet secret or private.</li>
<li><strong>Major points:</strong> <ul>
<li>Bob was able to encrypt a secret message for Alice without needing to know her key</li>
<li>The only “information” exchanged in public, where Eve could see it, was the result of one-way functions that produced data that would be “computationally hard” to crack. </li>
<li>Anyone, not just Alice, could make a sealed cup of beans and put it out in public with their name on it, allowing anyone else to encrypt a message just for them!</li>
<li>This is <strong>asymmetric</strong> encryption in a nutshell: one key can only be used to encrypt data, and a different (but related) key can only be used to decrypt.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Foreshadow the Next Lesson:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Say:</em> It’s important to understand how the process of public key cryptography works.  The “real” thing uses math instead of cups and beans, but the process is the same.  Tomorrow we’ll take a look at how the math works. (Don’t worry; it’s not that hard.)</li>
<li>Recap the cups and beans version of public key cryptography, using the terminology introduced on the activity guide.  Here is a breakdown:</li>

<td>Public Key</td>
<td>A key that can be used by anyone to encrypt a message for the intended recipient.  It is generated using a one-way function on the private key, so there is a relationship between the public and private keys, but figuring it out is a computationally hard problem.</td>
<td>Alice makes her public key by using the “one way function” of sealing the lid on the cup of beans, which makes cracking her private key a “hard problem.”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Encrypting (a message)</td>
<td>In public key cryptography, you encrypt a message using a one-way function with the intended recipient’s public key.</td>
<td>Bob encrypts a message by using Alice’s public cup of beans.  Adding beans to the cup is also a one-way function.  Bob can put the cup back out in public, knowing that cracking his message is a “hard” problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Decrypting (a message)</td>
<td>In public key cryptography, the recipient gets a message that has been encrypted with her public key.  She can use the private key to decrypt the message.  It works because of the relationship between the public and private keys.</td>
<td>Alice decrypts the message by taking the lid off the cup, dumping out the beans, and taking away the number of beans she “privately” added to the cup.  The lid on the cup represents a one-way function that Alice knows the answer to.  (This is the hardest analogy to make; we’ll see it for real in the next lesson.)</td>

<strong>Real World Concerns:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One nice side benefit of Asymmetric encryption is that it reduces the number of keys you need to know or remember.  With symmetric encryption, you would have to share a key with anyone and everyone you want to have secure transactions with. In public key cryptography (which uses asymmetric encryption) you don’t have to remember anything.  Just find the public key of whoever you want to communicate with (most common example: a website you want to send your credit card info to) and encrypt a message and send it off.  You know that only the holder of the private key for that public key can see it.</li>
<li>Of course, in the real world, we can’t use cups to send messages on the Internet! Why do you think this method doesn’t quite work on the Internet? (Teacher’s Note: In this activity, there was an implicit “look but don’t touch” rule. On the Internet, all bets are off. Anyone could “dump the cups” and count how many beans were in each. We need to make our public keys more secure!)  We’ll show how in the next lesson.</li>
<li>Public key cryptography is accomplished using mathematical one-way functions, and these functions need to be tough enough that they’re very hard or impossible for a computer to crack (just as it’s impossible to tell how many beans there are by looking at the cups). In the next lesson, we’ll look at a classic problem in computer science that is considered “computationally hard.” We’ll be leveraging these types of “computationally hard” problems to send messages using public key cryptography.</li>

<li>What additional security concerns might arise with public key cryptography? How do you know for sure that someone else’s public key belongs to him?</li>
<li>Read <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/chapter5.pdf" target="_blank">Blown to Bits (www.bitsbook.com), Chapter 5</a>, Secret Bits, pp. 174-178, Lessons for the Internet Age, then answer the following questions:<ul>
<li>The Fundamental Tenet of Cryptography is presented in the textbook as: “If lots of smart people have failed to solve a problem, then it probably won’t be solved (soon).”  Do you agree or disagree?  Why?  Does it inspire confidence in modern cryptography?</li>
<li>Chapter 5 introduces some basic encryption and security topics and talks about some misconceptions and mistakes people have made. From your own experience, do you think people are getting smarter about this? Is the public more aware or more complacent in recent years? How different do you think the technical population is from the general population?</li>
