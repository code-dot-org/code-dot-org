            <h2>Overview</h2>
            
                <p>In this kickoff to the Data Unit, students begin thinking about how data is collected and what can be learned from it. To begin the lesson, students will take a short online quiz that supposedly determines something interesting or funny about their personality. Afterwards they will brainstorm other sources of data in the world around them, leading to a discussion of how that data is collected. This discussion motivates the introduction of the Class Data Tracker project that will run through the first half of this unit. Students will take the survey for the first time and be shown what the results will look like. To close the class, students will make predictions of what they will find when all the data has been collected in a couple weeks.</p>
            

            
                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                
                    <p>This lesson introduces many of the lessons and themes that will run through the unit. Students are introduced to the Class Data Tracker and the fact that they will be collecting and analyzing their own data in a couple weeks. They also begin thinking about the many ways data impacts their lives and how it can be used. While the primary goal of this lesson is to get ideas and processes in place for the rest of the unit, there are many places where students can start asking interesting questions about where and how data is collected, who is collecting it, and how they are using it.</p>

                    <h2>Teacher Setup</h2>
                    <p>This lesson requires a somewhat unique setup in order to create a form for data collection with the students in your class.  Here are the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>You must have a Google Account</strong></p>
<p>If you have a school Google Account you probably want to be logged in with that account. If you do not have a Google account or would prefer not to use Google products for this lesson, see the Alternatives to Google section at the bottom of this setup guide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make a copy of the Google Form</strong></p>
<p>a) Click this link: http://bit.ly/CSP_Unit4_DataFormTemplate (This redirects to a Template for a Google Form.)</p>
<p>b) At the top-left of the screen, you should see something that looks like this:</p>
<p><a data-lightbox="all_images" data-title="" href="https://code.org/educate/docs/csp/U4L01-setup-1.png"><img alt="" src="https://code.org/educate/docs/csp/U4L01-setup-1.png"></a></p>
<p>That will make a copy of the form and add it to your Google Drive. </p>
<p>c) You will then see an editable version of the “Class Data Tracker” form. (<strong>NOTE:</strong> If you would like to make changes to this form to add or remove questions please see our notes about doing so below.)</p>
<p>d) Add a spreadsheet to collect responses…</p>
<p>At the top of the survey click RESPONSES:</p>
<p><a data-lightbox="all_images" data-title="" href="https://code.org/educate/docs/csp/U4L01-setup-2.png"><img alt="" src="https://code.org/educate/docs/csp/U4L01-setup-2.png"></a></p>
<p>Then click the green icon:</p>
<p><a data-lightbox="all_images" data-title="" href="https://code.org/educate/docs/csp/U4L01-setup-3.png"><img alt="" src="https://code.org/educate/docs/csp/U4L01-setup-3.png"></a></p>
<p>Then Click the CREATE button - use the default option to create a new spreadsheet:</p>
<p><a data-lightbox="all_images" data-title="" href="https://code.org/educate/docs/csp/U4L01-setup-4.png"><img alt="" src="https://code.org/educate/docs/csp/U4L01-setup-4.png"></a></p>
<p>It will then open up a new empty spreadsheet where responses to the survey will be collected.  You can close this spreadsheet for now.  We’ll get back to it later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Share a link to the form with your students</strong></p>
<p>a) Go back to the page that was showing the form. At the top-right of the page click the button that says SEND.</p>
<p><a data-lightbox="all_images" data-title="" href="https://code.org/educate/docs/csp/U4L01-setup-5.png"><img alt="" src="https://code.org/educate/docs/csp/U4L01-setup-5.png"></a></p>
<p>b) In the window that pops up, click the little Link Icon:</p>
<p><a data-lightbox="all_images" data-title="" href="https://code.org/educate/docs/csp/U4L01-setup-6.png"><img alt="" src="https://code.org/educate/docs/csp/U4L01-setup-6.png"></a></p>
<p>c) The window then shows a direct link to a live version of the form that anyone can fill out.  This is the link to share with students.  It’s probably easiest to choose the short URL version and to share that link with students.</p>
<p><a data-lightbox="all_images" data-title="" href="https://code.org/educate/docs/csp/U4L01-setup-7.png"><img alt="" src="https://code.org/educate/docs/csp/U4L01-setup-7.png"></a></p>
<p>You may alternatively want to share the link via the email option if you have a list of student email addresses you can use.</p>
<p>Place or post this link in a place where students have quick and easy access to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Whew, done!</strong></p>
<p>You should now have:</p>
<ul>
<li>A copy of a Google form in your Google Drive</li>
<li>A spreadsheet that will collect responses from the form in your Google Drive</li>
<li>A link that students should use to fill out the survey</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You will have students fill out this form EVERY DAY, or as frequently as possible over the next few weeks.  We will look at the results more fully in Lesson 7 of this unit.  You can place the form and spreadsheet documents wherever you like in your Google Drive.  They are yours now.</p>
<p><strong>NOTES:</strong></p>
<p><strong>For general help with Google Forms, go here:</strong> 
https://support.google.com/docs/topic/6063584?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=1360904</p>
<p><strong>Alternatives to Google Forms/Sheets</strong></p>
<p>You need some way for students to anonymously submit a survey every day and for the responses to be collected in a spreadsheet somewhere.  There are other survey products out there, such as <strong>Microsoft Excel Online</strong> or <strong>Survey Monkey</strong>, or you may also wish to do it with your school’s LMS, if that is an option for you.</p>
<p><strong>Editing the Survey Questions…</strong></p>
<p>The questions in this short survey have been chosen for certain properties they will have after students have filled out the survey repeatedly over a number of weeks.  If you choose to remove or change questions on the survey, or make your own completely different survey, please keep the following in mind, so that the future lessons in the unit (specifically 7, 8 and 9) will hold up.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Question</th>
<th>Properties we need</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>How many hours of sleep?<br>How many hours of work?<br>How many hours did you relax?</td>
<td>A free-form text entry that’s supposed to be a number.  We want this data to be free-form so that it gets a little “dirty.”  We have tasks and strategies for cleaning up the data later on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What did you do to relax?</td>
<td>Free-form text entry that could be anything, but a directed response to a question.  As a later task, students will look at these responses and try to fit them into categories so that the data is computable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>How do you feel today?</td>
<td>A fixed scalar response.  Something easy to plot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Which describes you (only child, oldest, middle, youngest sibling)?</td>
<td>A fixed response that will not change from day to day.  This is in lieu of some other way to track responses over time, like asking for other personally identifiable info like eye/hair color, or even name or student ID.  We want it to be anonymous but to be able to track <em>something</em> over time. <br><br>If you are comfortable adding a question about gender to the survey, that can lead to interesting investigations later on.</td>

                    <h2>Activity</h2>
                    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Introduce the class data tracker project.  The class will collect data about themselves so that students can see trends and patterns in the class’s behavior over time.</p>
<p><strong>Setup Reminder:</strong> Make sure you have prepared the Google form, and have the share link ready ahead of time.  See notes above. </p>
<p><strong>Say:</strong> As our first adventure into data, each of you is going to complete a short survey. Surveys are one of the best ways to collect data from people, and they are functionally no different from an online poll, funny quiz, or anything else that asks you for your opinion. We’re going to use our own survey, so that we can collect and see all the data.</p>
<h3 id="introduce-class-data-tracker-survey">Introduce Class Data Tracker survey.</h3>
<p><strong>Distribute:</strong>  Share the survey link with your students and have them complete it once. </p>
<p><a data-lightbox="all_images" data-title="" href="https://code.org/educate/docs/csp/U4L01-responses.png"><img alt="" class="right" src="https://code.org/educate/docs/csp/U4L01-responses.png"></a> <strong>Display the Initial Responses:</strong> Once everyone has filled out the survey, show them a glimpse of the results. You can find the results from your survey by clicking the Responses tab next to the Questions tab at the top of the form you made.</p>
<p>Display the responses on the board. Scroll through them, giving students a chance to see the data.  Try not to get hung up on issues of formatting, like a student who responded “seven hours” instead of “7” or “7 hours.”  </p>
<p>You may want to show the raw spreadsheet view instead of, or in addition to, the default “dump” of responses shown in the form.</p>
<p><strong>Briefly Discuss:</strong>  Have students look at the results from the survey and discuss what they notice.</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you notice?</li>
<li>What was surprising?</li>
<li>What do the results tell you about you and your answers?</li>
<li>What other information would you like? </li>
<li>What kind of questions would we need to ask to find out more information?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explain:</strong> You are going to complete this survey every day in class for the next several weeks.  By the end, we should have several hundred entries.  You’ve seen the questions and have taken a quick glimpse at the results. What do you think we might be able to find out in a few weeks?</p>
<p><strong>Prompt:</strong>  Write down one or two hypotheses (predictions) about what we might be able to find out about our class, assuming that everyone fills out this survey every day for a few weeks.  </p>

<p>If necessary, introduce (or review) the term hypothesis with your students. The CSP Framework has a learning objective that reads: 3.1.1 Find patterns, and test hypotheses about digitally processed information to gain insight and knowledge. [P4]  We will come back to these hypotheses when we look at the data in earnest a few lessons down the line.</p>
</div>

<p>Many will have probably seen the word in a science class.  The <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hypothesis" target="_blank">Merriam-Webster Dictionary</a> says a hypothesis is “an idea or theory that is not proven but that leads to further study or discussion.”</p>

                    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Get students to start thinking about where they interact with and produce data in their lives, by looking at their past experiences with online quizzes and surveys, to bridge the gap to a long-term class data collection activity.</p>
<h3 id="pop-quiz">Pop “Quiz.”</h3>
<p>Before saying anything, point students to this humorous online quiz and have them complete it: <a class="resource" href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/ashleyperez/what-city-should-you-actually-live-in" target="_blank">BuzzFeed Quiz: What city should you actually live in?</a></p>
<p><strong>Share Results:</strong> Allow students to share and compare which city they “should” live in.  It should be mildly amusing. The point of this little exercise will be revealed after the discussion.</p>
<p><strong>Say:</strong> This unit will address the topic of data more deeply. In computing, we’re interested in where data comes from, what structure or formats it comes in, and most importantly, what kind of knowledge or information we can extract from that data using computational tools.  </p>
<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> To get things started: People say there is data all around us. What do you think that means? Brainstorm as many examples of data as you can think of. For each one, try to answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is generating the data?</li>
<li>Where is the data being stored or saved? Who owns it?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="discussion">Discussion.</h3>
<p><strong>Discuss:</strong> Give students 2 minutes to jot down ideas before sharing with a neighbor. Do a whip-around to get ideas out in the air, perhaps writing them on the board. Student responses will vary widely and may be related to: </p>
<ul>
<li>cell phone data plans</li>
<li>science experiments</li>
<li>GPS tracking</li>
<li>online shopping data</li>
<li>taxes or accounting info</li>
<li>sports data</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure to point out that, for most of these examples, people are generating the data through their own actions, though sometimes they might not be aware of it.  In most cases this data is stored somewhere else, and by someone else.  The point to make is not a concern for privacy (yet) but simply the fact that there is lots of data housed in single locations, which makes it possible to compute with/on - some knowledge could be extracted from that data.</p>
<p><strong>Transition:</strong> Good, you identified all kinds of places that data comes from.  In this unit we’ll be looking at lots of those same examples and learning a bit about how to use, manipulate and visualize data with computational tools.  </p>
<p>In Computer Science, sometimes we can have the computer itself generate data for us. Recall that in Unit 3 we had the computer generate a lot of data for us by simulating the results of random coin flips.  This was easy to generate because the situation was straightforward to model.</p>
<p>Then, in the drawing app that we made, we used the computer to process a lot of data really quickly to produce visual effects. That data was generated by the user moving their mouse around the screen, so it was also relatively straightforward to capture.</p>
<p>But there are other kinds of data that can’t be generated by the computer.  In particular, data about people and how they act in the real world is hard to capture without just asking them. So that’s what a lot of tools online do. They try to capture people’s responses to things because the data, in aggregate, might contain useful information that could be extracted. That “dumb” online quiz you took at the beginning of class is an example. These quizzes ask people to reveal things about themselves, their preferences, likes and dislikes. This is data!  While these online quizzes are probably innocuous, some interesting things about people could probably be discovered if the data were analyzed.</p>
<p>As a class, we’re going to do something similar…</p>

                    <h2>Wrap-up</h2>
                    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Foreshadow the class data tracker project and the rest of the Unit.</p>
<p><strong>Share:</strong> Do a quick share-out of students’ hypotheses about what the class data will show in a few weeks.  What kinds of predictions did you make?</p>
<ul>
<li>Student responses will focus on different aspects of the data.  Anything related to time spent doing things outside of school and how it makes you feel is fair game.  In particular, you want to focus on hypotheses that hinge on a relationship between two elements of the data (e.g., maybe people who get more sleep tend to feel better), or predictions about trends or other patterns (e.g., I think most people will go to the movies to relax, but only on weekends).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Say:</strong> Those are all interesting ideas.  Many of them will require us to perform some computations on the results to find the answers, or spot other trends or patterns. Over the coming weeks, we’ll collect this data, and over that time, you’ll learn some things about how to process and visualize data like this, so you can see for yourself what kinds of knowledge the data holds.  Welcome to data.</p>
