<p>To conclude their study of cryptography, hard problems, and cybersecurity, students will complete a research project on a cybersecurity innovation of their choosing. Students will need to identify appropriate online resources to learn about the functionality, context, and impact of their cybersecurity innovation. After completing their research, students will present their findings both in a written summary and with an audio / visual artifact they found online. The written components and audio / visual artifact students will identify are similar to those students will see in the AP Performance Tasks. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is NOT the official AP® Performance Task that will be submitted as part of the Advanced Placement exam; it is a practice activity intended to prepare students for some portions of their individual performance at a later time.</p>
            

            
                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                
                    <p>This lesson does not cover new CS content with the possible exception of some of the things in the Cybercrime video.  This lesson is an opportunity for students to synthesize their knowledge and understanding of cybersecurity, cryptography, computationally hard problems, and other Internet-related issues in the practice PT. For reference topics from previous lessons and videos, include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Encryption and Algorithms</li>
<li>Cracking an Encryption with Heuristics (i.e., frequency analysis)</li>
<li>Symmetric Encryption (i.e., Caesar and Vigenère)</li>
<li>Asymmetric Encryption </li>
<li>Computationally Hard Problems </li>
<li>Public Key Encryption</li>
<li>One-way Functions</li>
<li>Open Standards</li>
<li>Certificate Authorities</li>
</ul>

                    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                    <p><strong>Show:</strong> Show the video <a class="resource" href="https://youtu.be/AuYNXgO_f3Y" target="_blank">The Internet: Cybersecurity and Crime</a> to the class as a means of motivating the coming project.</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> At the end of the year you will need to complete the Explore Performance Task. The project we’re about to do asks you to conduct research on a computing innovation of your choosing and present your findings both visually and in writing. As we just saw the story of cybersecurity is one of constant innovation on the part of security specialists and hackers. In fact we’ve seen in this entire unit how the story of encryption in general is one of developing innovative techniques to secure our information, only for innovative solutions to cracking those encryptions to be discovered.</p>
<p>To conclude our study of the Internet you will be completing a practice Performance Task on a cybersecurity topic of your choosing. Hopefully this will be an enjoyable opportunity to dig deeper on a topic that piqued your interest over the last few weeks, and it will of course be useful preparation for the Explore Performance Task, which you’ll do at the end of the year.</p>
<p><strong>Distribute:</strong> Distribute the <a href="Cybersecurity Innovations" target="_blank">Practice PT - Cybersecurity Innovations</a> and as a class review the project guidelines and rubric. Respond to questions.</p>

                    <p>A proposed schedule of the steps of this project is included below, as well as more thorough explanations of how to conduct the various stages. </p>
<p><strong>Day 1</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Review Project Guidelines and Rubric</li>
<li>Select an innovation to research</li>
<li>Identify online sources of information using the Research Guide</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Day 2</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Continue to record findings in their Research Guide</li>
<li>Identify potential artifacts to include</li>
<li>Begin writing written responses</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Day 3</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Complete any remaining research to answer questions</li>
<li>Select and make any necessary edits to artifacts</li>
<li>Complete written responses</li>
</ul>

<p class="admonition-title" id="tip_None"><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i>Teaching Tips</p>
<div></div>
<div>
<p><strong>Difference from the actual Explore PT:</strong> The actual Explore Performance Task will be completed over 8 class hours. The fact that this schedule is significantly shorter reflects several differences in this Practice PT.</p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>A general category of topics has been specified ahead of time</li>
<li>Several written responses have been eliminated</li>
<li>Students do not need to create their own artifacts (though they may if they so choose)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p>The primary goal of this Practice PT is to familiarize students with the format of the Explore PT and the thinking practices they will need to employ when completing it. Students will continue to develop skills over units 3 and 4 which will allow them to complete the full PT at the end of the year.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3 id="complete-the-practice-pt">Complete the Practice PT.</h3>
<p><strong>Read Requirements:</strong> Students should already have copies of the Practice PT. At the beginning of the project emphasize the importance of reviewing the rubric. Students may assume that more is required of them than is actually the case. In particular emphasize that they do not need to create their artifact themselves, but it must still meet the requirements of the project. Point out that the written component of the project is almost identical to what students did in Lesson 12 - The Internet and Society.</p>
<p><strong>Choosing Topics:</strong> It is recommended that you place a time limit on this process (e.g. 20 minutes). Students should not leave class after the first day without a topic in mind and ideally with some resources identified. Luckily, in choosing their topics students will likely have begun to identify resources they can use in completing their project.</p>
<p><strong>Complete the Research Guide:</strong> This document is intended to serve primarily as a guide to students. The skill students need to develop is identifying useful resources on their own and then synthesizing this information. Being presented with a structured way of doing this means students will have a model for how to complete their research when completing the actual Explore PT.</p>
<p><strong>Identify an Artifact:</strong> This is perhaps the greatest deviation between the Practice PT and the actual PT. Students do not need to create their own artifact. Instead they need to identify an audio or visual artifact (image, visualization, drawing, chart, video, interview, etc.) that highlights a harm or benefit caused by their innovation. This may still be a challenging process. The goal is to help students think about what good audio / visual artifacts look like and how they present complex material. In units 3 and 4 they will develop skills that will allow them to develop these artifacts on their own.</p>
<p><strong>Written Responses:</strong> Students should find this aspect of their project most familiar. The prompts are similar in style and content to prompts students have already seen. Emphasize the need for clarity in their writing, and remind them that while the 300 word limit is a maximum, they do not necessarily need to write 300 words for each prompt. If they have responded completely to each of the prompts it is fine to write less.</p>
<p><strong>Submission:</strong> On the Explore Performance Task students are asked to compile all of their written work into a single PDF. You will need to determine how best to collect this work in your class but you may optionally wish to practice this process when collecting submissions for this project.</p>

                    <p><strong>Presentation (Optional):</strong> If time allows students may wish to have an opportunity to share their research with one another. Consider other options like creating a “Digital Cybersecurity Museum” by posting links to all their projects to a single shared document.</p>
