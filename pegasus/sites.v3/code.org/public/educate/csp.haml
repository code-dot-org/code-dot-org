    %p Compared with similarly-situated schools, <a href="http://www.westcoastanalytics.com/uploads/6/9/6/7/69675515/wca_code_final_report_2018.pdf">a school's participation in the Code.org Professional Learning program causes an estimated five-fold increase</a> in the number of students that take, and earn qualifying scores on the AP Computer Science Principles exam. And teachers love it! Over 90% rank it the best professional development ever.
