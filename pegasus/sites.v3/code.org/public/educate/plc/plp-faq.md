### **My city isn't on the map, can I stil apply to be a Professional Learning Partner?**

For this year, we are only looking for professional learning partners in the cities where Code.org has a district partnership and has teachers enrolled in the Code.org Computer Science Principles Professional Learning Program. If you are interested in becoming a Professional Learning Partner for the 2017-18 school year and are willing to help recruit school districts in your area, please email partner@code.org and we will connect you with the District Outreach Manager for your state.

### **Does my organization need to provide facilitators for professional development?**

Your organization does not need to have its own facilitators. Code.org Professional Learning Partners can  opt to contract with local Code.org approved facilitators instead.

### **Can I recruit teachers from local districts to become a part of the 2016-17 CS Principles professional learning program?**

Our general rule: A teacher must be from a district that Code.org has a district partnership with to apply for the CS Principles professional learning program. However, you are welcome to encourage local teachers who have a spot on their master schedule to teach AP Computer Science Principles in the Fall to join our program's wait list.
