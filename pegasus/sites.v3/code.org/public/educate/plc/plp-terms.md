# Professional Learning Partner Term Sheet #



## Your Commitment (Professional Learning Partner)

- Provide a dedicated Professional Learning Partner Program Manager who will participate fully in the Program Manager onboarding & on-going program management responsibilities. (this is a 0.15 FTE time commitment at first, but will grow with time)
- Attend our Facilitation Summit, May 20-22, 2016 in Nashville, TN
- Attend our 5-day Code.org TeacherCon with teachers from your state
	- June 20-24 in Atlanta, GA - states attending (AL, FL, GA, KY, IN, MD, NC, OH, TX)
	- July 18-22 in Salt Lake City, UT - states attending (WA, CA, ID, AZ, NV, UT)
	- August 8-12 in Chicago, IL - states attending (IL, MA, MI, NJ, NY)
- Organize and host quality, local PD for Code.org’s District Partners implementing Code.org’s high school and middle school programs, with Code.org-accredited facilitators
	- In Year 1 (2016-17) this is for the (AP) Computer Science Principles course. 
	- In Year 2 (2017-18) this is for <a href="/educate/plc/csp" target=_blank>CS Principles</a> AND <a href="/educate/csd" target=_blank>CS Discoveries</a>.	
	- In initial years, this is for four 1-day professional learning workshops during the school year per course, to provide teachers who have attended our summer conferences with continuing professional learning during the school year. Timing of workshops could be adjusted to local needs.
	- In future years we hope your commitment can eventually include taking full responsibility of all of Code.org’s professional learning programs in the region
- Contract with and compensate local Code.org-accredited facilitators to lead the professional learning workshops
- Build, grow and sustain a local community of computer science educators (or join an existing community)
	- In Year 1 (2016-17): 
organize informal local meetups for educators, ideally together with a local university or corporation and promote the December Hour of Code campaign locally 
	- In Year 2 (2017-18), also organize and host  a spring “CS Fair” for schools
- Possess existing funding streams, and sufficient funding and finance infrastructure to cover upfront workshop costs and pay facilitators and teachers prior to Code.org reimbursement.
- Commit to ongoing communication with Code.org on metrics and model improvements, as necessary
- Comply with the Code.org <a href="/privacy" target=_blank>privacy policy</a>

## Code.org Commitment
- Host the Facilitation Summit in Nashville, TN.
- Pay for round-trip airfare, hotel, ground transportation to and from the airport, and meals during the Facilitation Summit and the summer professional development workshop in Year 1 of the partnership.
- Host the 5-day Code.org TeacherCon for CS Principles starting in Year 1 of the partnership, and for the CS Discoveries starting in Year 2.
- For each cohort of teachers, Code.org will provide funding for a flat amount of overall PD costs + a rate per teacher in the cohort. We expect these costs will cover staffing, facilitator compensation, food, and venue, for four 1-day workshops (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GuyAGGwFrtGB6l2hHLFc-N6thuMs6BcQzTp_XjaU454/edit#gid=0" target=_blank>see example budget here</a>). You may work out a different schedule of workshops with the local school districts, as long as it’s within these costs.
  - For a cohort of 10 or fewer teachers, the funding would amount to $6,000 for overall costs + $160 per teacher in the cohort.
  - For a cohort of more than 10 teachers, the funding would amount to $8,000 for overall costs + $160 per teacher in the cohort.
  - For urban areas, there would be a 25% multiplier added to the costs.
  - For <5 teachers, the PD would be done online.
- Provide promotional materials to assist in community-building.
- Introduce the Professional Learning Partner to local school districts interested in bringing computer science professional development to their teachers.
- Authorize use of the “In Partnership with Code.org” logo on promotional materials the Professional Learning Partner develops.
- Provide the workshop supplies as well as materials for teachers such as a virtual curriculum guide containing course lesson plans, certificates of completion, and classroom supplies for some activities.
- Evaluate your success based on a mixture of factors, which could include a count of teachers participating in workshops, workshop evaluation reports, teacher surveys, and actual participation/performance by students in classrooms hosted by these teachers.

## Joint Commitment
- We will work together to transition your work to 100% local funding. Our vision for this is that the long-term funding comes from state or local sources. We will provide you guidance, introductions, sample grant applications, etc., and establish you as a Code.org-accredited provider. In some regions, we may also be able to connect you to local philanthropists.
- We will collaborate to establish your organization as a certified regional provider of computer science PD, so teachers from local districts can receive formal PD credit.
- We will cooperate to identify, recruit, build and maintain local facilitator capacity. Facilitators need to meet Code.org’s established selection criteria.

We view this to be a long-term partnership. We see your organization as joining a network of organizations supporting a nationwide movement. We hope to find many ways beyond the scope of this document to cooperate in spreading computer science in K-12 schools. That could mean hosting workshops for elementary school teachers, working together to sign up new school districts to teach computer science, cooperating on state level policy efforts, or more. For now, we want to focus on a limited set of work to begin our relationship. 

This is not a binding document. This is a new program, so Code.org may change some of these terms in subsequent years.

**Next Steps:** If your organization agrees to these terms, please <a href="/educate/plc/plp-application" target=_blank>complete an application</a> to become a Code.org Professional Learning Partner.

**2016 Code.org TeacherCon Dates:**
It is strongly advised that each Professional Learning Partner Program Manager attend the Code.org TeacherCon nearest their region, in order to connect with local teachers.

- July 18-22 in Salt Lake City, UT - states attending (WA, CA, ID, AZ, NV, UT)
