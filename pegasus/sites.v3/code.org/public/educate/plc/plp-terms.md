# Professional Learning Partner Terms Sheet #

Code.org is establishing partnerships with local organizations to help replicate our work in a local, sustainable fashion. Our goal is for these local organizations to work with Code.org’s School District Partners to host professional learning workshops for teachers who are new to computer science, and to build and sustain a local community of computer science educators. We will provide the training, support, and initial funding to help each of these organizations establish themselves as the local partner of the Code.org professional learning community, with an expectation that each partner can find other sources of funding and sustain this work independently of Code.org in the long-run.

The ideal Professional Learning Partner is a regional education unit, a non-profit, a school district, or a university with existing, positive relationships with nearby school districts and the local education community. Additionally, this partner must have experience managing and hosting professional development workshops.

All Professional Learning Partners selected to participate in the program will send a program manager to attend a 2.5 day, all-expense-paid Facilitation Summit in TBD (May 20-22, 2016) and a 5-day regional summer professional learning experience (see below for dates). Code.org will pay for round-trip airfare, hotel and meals for both of these events. 

During the 2.5-day Facilitation Summit, Code.org will prepare your organization’s program manager to organize in-person workshops for local educators interested in teaching computer science using Code.org curricula in their classrooms. The Facilitation Summit is designed to be a fabulous experience to welcome Professional Learning Partners and facilitators to the extended Code.org family. During the 5-day summer professional learning experience, your program manager will have an opportunity to see examples of strong computer science facilitation, learn how to run a regional conference, and meet the new teachers who will be part of the local CS community, and attend workshops hosted by your organization for the next year.

In addition to this training, we will provide each Professional Learning Partner with support, and initial funding to host local workshops and build local community around computer science. 

## Your Committment (Professional Learning Partner)

- Provide a dedicated Professional Learning Partner Program Manager who will participate fully in the Program Manager onboarding & on-going program management responsibilities. (this is a ¼ FTE time commitment at first, but will grow with time)
- Attend our Facilitation Summit, May 20-22, 2016. Location TBD
- Attend our 5-day Summer Professional Learning Experience with teachers from your state
	- June 20-24 in Atlanta, GA - states attending (AL, FL, GA, KY, IN, MD, NC, OH, TX)
	- July 18-22 in Salt Lake City, UT - states attending (WA, CA, ID, AZ, NV, UT)
	- August 8-12 in Chicago, IL - states attending (IL, MA, MI, NJ, NY)
- Organize and host quality, local PD for Code.org’s District Partners implementing Code.org’s High School and Middle School programs, with Code.org-accredited facilitators
	- In Year 1 (2016-17) this is for the (AP) Computer Science Principles course. 
	- In Year 2 (2017-18) this is for CS Principles AND an intro course for grades 6-9.
	- In initial years, this is for four 1-day professional learning workshops during the school year per course, to provide teachers who have attended our summer conferences with continuing professional learning during the school year. Timing of workshops could be adjusted to local needs.
	- In future years we hope your commitment can eventually include taking full responsibility of all of Code.org’s professional learning programs in the region
- Contract with and compensate local Code.org-accredited facilitators to lead the professional learning workshops
- Build, grow and sustain a local community of computer science educators (or join an existing community)
	- In Year 1 (2016-17): 
organize informal local meetups for educators, ideally together with a local university or corporation
promote the December Hour of Code campaign locally 
	- In Year 2 (2017-18), also organize and host  a spring “CS Fair” for schools
- Possess existing funding streams, and sufficient funding and finance infrastructure to cover upfront workshop costs and pay facilitators and teachers prior to Code.org reimbursement.
- Commit to ongoing communication with Code.org on metrics and model improvements, as necessary
- Comply with Code.org <a href="/privacy" target=_blank>privacy policy</a>

## Code.org Committment
- Host the Facilitation Summit in TBD.
- Pay for round-trip airfare, hotel, ground transportation to and from the airport, and meals during the Facilitation Summit and the summer professional development workshop in Year 1 of the partnership.
- Host the 5-day summer professional development workshop for CS Principles starting with Year 1 of the partnership, and for the Code.org intro CS course starting with Year 2.
- For each cohort of teachers, Code.org will provide funding for a flat amount of overall PD costs + a rate per teacher in the cohort. We expect these costs will cover staffing, facilitator compensation, food, and venue, for four 1-day workshops (see example budget here). You may work out a different schedule of workshops with the local school districts, as long as it’s within these costs.
  - For a cohort of 10 or fewer teachers, the funding would amount to $4,000 for overall costs + $160 per teacher in the cohort.
  - For a cohort of more than 10 teachers, the funding would amount to $6,000 for overall costs + $160 per teacher in the cohort.
  - For urban districts, there would be a 25% multiplier added to the costs.
  - For <5 teachers, the PD would be done online.
- Provide promotional materials to assist in community-building.
- Introduce the Professional Learning Partner to local school districts interested in bringing computer science professional development to their teachers.
- Authorize use of the “In Partnership with Code.org” logo on promotional materials the Professional Learning Partner develops.
- Provide the workshop supplies as well as materials for teachers such as a virtual curriculum guide containing course lesson plans, certificates of completion, and classroom supplies for some activities.
- Evaluate your success based on a mixture of factors, which could include a count of teachers participating in workshops, workshop evaluation reports, teacher surveys, and actual participation/performance by students in classrooms hosted by these teachers.

## Joint Committment
- We will cooperate together to transition your work to 100% local funding. Our vision for this is that the long-term funding comes from state or local sources. We will provide you guidance, introductions, sample grant applications, etc., and establish you as a Code.org-accredited provider. In some regions, we may also be able to connect you to local philanthropists.
- We will collaborate to establish your organization as a certified regional provider of computer science PD, so teachers from local districts can receive formal PD credit.
- We will cooperate to identify, recruit, build and maintain local facilitator capacity. Facilitators need to meet Code.org’s established selection criteria.

We view this to be a long-term partnership. We see your organization as joining a network of organizations supporting a nationwide movement. We hope to find many ways beyond the scope of this document to cooperate in spreading computer science in K-12 schools. That could mean hosting workshops for elementary school teachers, working together to sign up new school districts to computer science, cooperating on state level policy efforts, or more. For now, we want to focus on a limited set of work to begin our relationship. 

This is not a binding document. This is a new program, so Code.org may change some of these terms in subsequent years.

**Next Steps:** If your organization agrees to these terms, please <a href="/educate/plc/plp-application" target=_blank>complete an application</a> to become a Code.org Professional Learning Partner.

**Code.org 2016 Summer Workshop Dates:**
It is strongly advised that each Professional Learning Partner Program Manager attend the workshop nearest their region, in order to connect with local teachers.

- June 20-24 in Atlanta, GA - states attending (AL, FL, GA, KY, IN, MD, NC, OH, TX)
- July 18-22 in Salt Lake City, UT - states attending (WA, CA, ID, AZ, NV, UT)
- August 8-12 in Chicago, IL - states attending (IL, MA, MI, NJ, NY)
