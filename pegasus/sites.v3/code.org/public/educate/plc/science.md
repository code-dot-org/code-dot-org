# CS Principles Professional Learning Program #

## About the Curriculum

Code.org has partnered with the award-winning Project GUTS (Growing Up Thinking Scientifically) to deliver a middle school science program consisting of four instructional modules. An introduciton, life, physical, and earth science modules are blended together to showcase the connection between computer science modeling and traditional middle school science curriculum.
<br/>
<br/>
CS in Science is based on a crosswalk identifying areas of overlap between the NGSS and Computer Science Teachers Association K-12 Computer Science Standards.
<br/>
<br/>
Through a rigorous yet introductory professional development this program introduces computer science concepts into science classrooms within the context of modeling and simulation.

## <a name="about"></a>About the Professional Learning Program
 
 
#### <a name="components"></a>How does it work?
The Code.org CS in Science program is built with professional development (PD) and curriculum that flow together seamlessly, representing one cohesive set of resources that empowers teachers to deliver the course with confidence. 
<br/>
<br/>
Since the PD program lives both in-person and online, participants are supported throughout their first year of teaching CS in Science with PD that is “job-embedded”. Many of the supports, including videos, curriculum, and a crosswalk of CSTA and NGSS standards, are available at the [CS in Science](code.org/curriculum/mss) homepage (code.org/curriculum/mss).
