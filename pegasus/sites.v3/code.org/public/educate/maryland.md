# Teach Computer Science at Your School

## Why Computer Science?

Computer science opens more doors for students than any other discipline in today’s world. Learning even the basics will help students lead in virtually any career  from architecture to zoology.  Just as we teach students multiplication and division, or how electricity works, it’s important for every 21st century student to have a chance to “dissect an app,” or learn how the Internet works.


## Professional learning program — at no cost to schools

### Participating teachers consistently call our professional development, "The best professional development I've ever had!"

### Middle School

Our current middle school curriculum focuses on using computer science and programming within the context of middle school math and science - as a tool to teach math and science concepts.
<br/>

#### Computer Science in Algebra

Code.org has partnered with Bootstrap to develop a curriculum which teaches algebraic and geometric concepts through computer programming. The twenty lessons focus on concepts like order of operations, the Cartesian plane, function composition and definition, and solving word problems - all within the context of video game design. By shifting classwork from abstract pencil-and-paper problems to a series of relevant programming problems, Code.org CS in Algebra demonstrates how algebra applies in the real world, using an exciting, hands-on approach to create something cool.

- **July 25 - 26** at the College of Southern Maryland
