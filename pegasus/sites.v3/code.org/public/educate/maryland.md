# Teach Computer Science at Your School

## Why Computer Science?

Computer science opens more doors for students than any other discipline in today’s world. Learning even the basics will help students lead in virtually any career  from architecture to zoology.  Just as we teach students multiplication and division, or how electricity works, it’s important for every 21st century student to have a chance to “dissect an app,” or learn how the Internet works.


## Professional learning program — at no cost to schools

### Participating teachers consistently call our professional development, "The best professional development I've ever had!"
