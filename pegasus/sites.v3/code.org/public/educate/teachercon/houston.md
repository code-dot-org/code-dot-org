## **What is TeacherCon?**

TeacherCon is an intensive, hands-on, in-person workshop providing foundational experiences with computer science and the Code.org suite of tools. The five-day workshop is the primary capacity building experience for teachers prior to their first year of instruction. Participants will explore the curriculum and tools, consider and experiment with specific classroom management and teaching strategies, and build a local community of teachers who are also using this curriculum.

## **Travel & Hotel Information**
### NEW INFO: How to get from the airport to the hotel!
**Want to share a ride from the airport to the hotel with fellow TeacherCon attendees?**

For privacy reasons, Code.org is not able to share attendee contact information, but you're welcome to meet up with each other at the airport and ride together to the hotel. If you'd like to share a ride, our suggestion is to join a group meeting every 30 minutes between 10 am and 4:30 pm inside the airport (see suggested meeting locations below), and then find a taxi, Uber, or Lyft together. **Please note that Code.org staff will not be at the meeting location.** When you get to the meeting location, make sure to ask others nearby if they are part of TeacherCon.

<summary>**Should I book my own travel to TeacherCon?**</summary>
  <p>
  <br>
  **Please DO NOT make travel or lodging arrangements before we send you travel booking details.** You will receive an email from us approximately seven weeks ahead of your scheduled TeacherCon with detailed information about how to book your flight through our travel system, Egencia. We also have a room set aside for you at our conference hotel, so you don’t need to make a reservation.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>**What if I choose to drive to TeacherCon?**</summary>
  <p>
  <br>
If you choose to drive to TeacherCon instead of fly, and are driving over 25 miles one-way, you will receive a $150 gift card at the end of August to help cover the cost of mileage. **No additional reimbursements will be provided for driving**.
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>**Will I need additional transportation once I arrive at TeacherCon?**</summary>
  <p>
  <br>
You will not need to rent a vehicle while at TeacherCon since all conference sessions and meals will take place on site at the hotel. If your Regional Event is off-site, transportation options will be provided. If you are flying, you will need to arrange your own transportation to and from the airport (ex: SuperShuttle, ride share or taxi). Plan to pay for this upfront but we will provide you a gift card that will cover the cost once you arrive at the hotel. (see expenses covered for details, below).
</p>
</details>

<details>

**These include:**

* Flights to and from your assigned TeacherCon Location **OR** mileage gift card for attendees driving over 25 miles one-way.
* A room for you at the hotel -- No need to make a reservation, we have booked this for you!
* Catered breakfast, lunch, and snacks, Monday through Friday; dinner on Sunday and Wednesday

All participants will receive a $300 gift card upon their arrival to cover any additional expenses such as meals we do not provide, and other incidentals such as baggage fees, parking, taxis, public transportation, etc. No additional reimbursements will be provided to attendees or districts.
</p>
</details>

## **What to Bring**
<details>
  <summary>**What should I pack?**</summary>
  <p>
  <br>
We encourage **business casual** attire during TeacherCon. All our conference sessions are indoors, and air conditioning is usually cool in hotels. We recommend that you bring a light sweater if you get cold easily in air conditioned rooms. You can expect temperatures to be quite warm during the day, so pack a water bottle! If you plan to venture outdoors during your free time, be sure to check the local forecast and plan accordingly!
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>**What devices will I need to bring?**</summary>
  <p>
  <br>
Please bring your laptop/Chromebook and charger, as well as any adapters. If you’re bringing a school or district owned laptop/Chromebook, please make sure you have administrator permissions.

**Note**: *Our CS Discoveries and Principles courses are not optimized for tablets, so we do not recommend bringing a tablet as your primary device to this event.*

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>**Will I have any free time?**</summary>
  <p>
  <br>
Of course! Sessions end each day at 4:30pm, which leaves plenty of time in the evenings to explore the area and spend time with the folks you meet throughout the day. In addition, we ask that you join our Sunday and Wednesday evening events, as these are important opportunities to connect with your fellow educators and build community. Otherwise, your evenings are free!
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>**What if I can't attend for the full week?**</summary>
  <p>
  <br>
We expect you to attend for the full conference. Make plans to be with us from Registration on Sunday afternoon through the Closing Ceremonies on Friday afternoon to ensure that you receive the full training experience. We would love to have local teachers join us for registration and the Kick-Off dinner on Sunday evening. If you are not able to attend the dinner on Sunday evening, please plan to join us Monday morning by 8:00am to have time to register before sessions begin at 8:30am. If you have any concerns, please let us know at
[teacher@code.org](mailto:teacher@code.org).
