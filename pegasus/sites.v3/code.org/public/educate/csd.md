# Computer Science Discoveries

## <a name="what"></a>What is CS Discoveries?

Computer Science Discoveries is appropriate for 6 - 10th grade students and can be taught as a semester or year long introductory course (3-5 hours per week of instruction for 9+ weeks). The course takes a wide lens on computer science by covering topics such as programming, physical computing, HTML/CSS, and data. The course inspires students as they build their own websites, apps, games, and physical computing devices. Our curriculum is available at [no cost](/commitment) for anyone, anywhere to teach. For more information about our goals and approach to our courses, please see our [curriculum values](/educate/curriculum/values) and our [professional learning values](/educate/professional-learning/values).

## <a name="what"></a>Professional Learning

Our middle and high school programs offer year-round support. The program kicks off with a 5-day summer workshop where you'll have an opportunity to work hands-on with the curriculum and meet other teachers from your area. Throughout the year, we offer online support for upcoming units, forum support, and 1-day quarterly workshops. You don't need any prior computer science experience to get started. And teachers love it! 90% rank it the best professional development ever.

**General applications for the 2018-19 [CS Discoveries Professional Learning Program](/educate/professional-learning/cs-discoveries) will open in January, 2018.**

## <a name="faq"></a>Frequently Asked Questions

### <a name="timeline"></a>What is the timeline for CS Discoveries?

All units are released at this time and can be used by teachers and classrooms. In Winter 2017, we will be releasing a revised version of Unit 6 to incorporate feedback from our Spring 2017 pilot.

### <a name="standards"></a>Will CS Discoveries be mapped to standards?

CS Discoveries was written using both the K-12 Framework for Computer Science and the newly revised 2017 CSTA standards as guidance. Currently, every lesson in CS Discoveries contains mappings to the relevant 2017 CSTA standards.
 The summary of of all CSTA 2017 mappings can be found at [curriculum.code.org/csd/standards](https://curriculum.code.org/csd/standards)

###  <a name="implementation"></a>I’m teaching CS Discoveries but have less than one semester with my students. What would you recommend?
CS Discoveries consists of two semesters that build on each other.  Schools can choose to teach a single semester, two sequential semesters, or a single, year-long course.  For courses that meet fewer than three hours a week or last for less than a trimester, we recommend [CS Fundamentals Express](/educate/curriculum/express-course), a 30+ hour course that covers the foundational concepts of programming.

Some schools may want to use parts of the CS Discoveries curriculum without running an entire semester of the course.  We always suggest starting with at least the first chapter of Unit 1 to build the classroom culture and problem solving skills the rest of the course depends on.  Afterwards, students can move on to any of Units 2 - 5, either completing the entire unit or stopping at the end of the Chapter 1 project.  Because of the programming knowledge required for Unit 6, students should only attempt it after completing Unit 3.

### <a name="supplies"></a>What materials and supplies are required for CS Discoveries?

* Normal classroom supplies (pens, pencils, coloring, scissors, extra paper) 
* Computers 
* Worksheet Printing (There are worksheets with some lessons. Some teachers get around this by doing everything digitally.) 
* Couple Decks of Cards 
* Aluminum Foil 
* Containers that can hold water 
* [Adafruit's Circuit Playground Boards](/circuitplayground) and Micro USB cables. The curriculum is designed for a ratio of 2 students to 1 board & 1 usb cable.***

\*** For teachers participating in our 2017-18 Professional Learning Program who are implementing the full-year version of the course, we will be subsidizing or partially subsidizing one classroom kit of Adafruit Circuit Playground Boards. This kit contains 15 boards and accessories and supports a classroom of 30 students, assuming a 2:1 ratio of students to boards. To learn more about the classroom kit, software requirements, and the details of the subsidy visit [code.org/circuitplayground](/circuitplayground)  \***

### <a name="pathway"></a>How does CS Discoveries fit with the other Code.org courses?

CS Discoveries is designed to fit naturally between our [CS Fundamentals](/educate/curriculum/elementary-school) courses and our [CS Principles](/educate/csp) course. While each of these courses is designed to be an age-appropriate entry point to computer science, students with previous experience will find many new topics to explore, and they will revisit familiar topics in novel and more challenging contexts.

<!--
#### Can I pilot the new course?

We will be formally piloting the course with select groups in the Spring of the 16/17 school year - if you are interested in participating in this pilot please complete the application form here.

As lessons are completed we will also be publishing them on the website we invite anyone to try them out - both the lessons and any new tools or software - and let us know how it went.  Our desire is that the curriculum will be a living document and not something set in stone. We are open to changes or alternatives to lessons so please send us your feedback by using the forum.

#### How/Where can I get professional development for this course?

We are now accepting applications for the 2017-18 Professional Learning Program for CS Discoveries!
