## Be a Professional Learning Partner
### Partners needed in Las Vegas, NYC, and Orlando
Code.org is selecting organizations, as partners, to help teach computer science in a local, sustainable fashion. We view these to be long-term partnerships with selected partners joining a network of organizations supporting a nationwide computer science movement.
 
Each partner's program manager will attend our Facilitation Summit, a fabulous experience designed to welcome Professional Learning Partners and facilitators to the extended Code.org family. In addition, we will provide the initial funding to help each organization establish itself as a local Code.org professional learning partner.

The ideal Professional Learning Partner is a regional education unit, a non-profit, a school district, or a university with existing, positive relationships with nearby school districts and the local education community. We are still looking for applicants to the program in Las Vegas, New York City, and Orlando. We hope you will apply!
