# Computer Science Principles: Monthly Meetings

## What is a monthly meeting?

Each month, Code.org is pleased to host a free, online webinar for CSP teachers. Meetings will be hosted by Code.org staff and feature guest speakers, CSP teaching tips and an opportunity for educators to connect with the national community of Code.org CSP teachers.

## When do the monthly meetings occur?

CSP Monthly Meetings take place on the first Wednesday of every month at 7:00 pm Central Time (GMT-5:00). Below is a list of all the monthly meetings scheduled for the 2015-16 school year.

## What can I expect during a monthly meeting?

All monthly meetings will follow the same general format:

- **Welcome and review of agenda** (5 minutes)
- **Important reminders this month** (5 minutes)
- **Guest speaker, presenting on a topic related to CSP** (10 minutes)
- **Guest speaker Q&A** (5 minutes)
- **Presentation: Teaching Tips for CSP** (5-10 minutes)
- **Whole Group Discussion / Q&A** (10-15 minutes)
- **Close and Next Steps** (5-10 minutes)

If you register for each meeting, you’ll receive an email with the final agenda (including info about the guest speaker and the presentation) at least one week before the meeting is scheduled to take place, so you can decide whether or not you want to attend live or just view a recording later.

## How do I attend a monthly meeting?

To attend, follow these steps:

- **[Register](http://www.eventbrite.com/o/codeorg-teacher-community-8317327577) for the event(s) that interest you.** Registering in advance ensures that you will receive an email reminder, be notified of any changes to the event, and guarantees that you will receive an email with a link to the event recording after the event ends.
- **Mark your calendar** When you register, you’ll have the option of adding the event to your calendar.
- **Check the date and time in your time zone** We recommend you use [timeanddate.com](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html) to ensure you have the correct timing. All events are scheduled in the Central time zone (GMT-5 hours)
- **Navigate to [code.bluejeans.com/teach](http://code.bluejeans.com/teach)** The meeting room will be open approximately 10 minutes before the meeting is scheduled to start. You don’t need to login to join the meeting, you can join as a guest.

## Is attendance required?

For educators currently enrolled in our Code.org CSP professional development for the 2015-16 school year, attendance at the monthly meetings is **highly recommended but optional.** If you cannot attend a meeting, you can view a recording. Join us if you can! 

## I’m not currently enrolled in Code.org CSP professional development. Can I still attend?

Unfortunately, these meetings are intended for CSP pilot teachers only. If you are not part of the program, please do not attend without permission from the facilitator.

## What if I can’t attend a meeting?

You should register anyway, and we will send you a link to the recording so you can view it later. If you do not register, you can find a list of all past events and their recordings on [our Eventbrite page](http://www.eventbrite.com/o/codeorg-teacher-community-8317327577). Just click on “Past Events.”
