# 2018-19 Middle and High School Professional Learning#
<%= view :professional_learning_apply_banner %>



## New to computer science? No worries.

Whether you are new to teaching computer science (CS) or have experience teaching other CS courses, the program is designed to promote growth by providing space for you to become comfortable with curricular materials, CS content, and pedagogy. Our curriculum provides a complete set of lesson plans that include inquiry-based activities, videos, assessment support, and educational tools.

The program supports teachers with diverse teaching backgrounds as they prepare to teach either of the following courses:

<%= view :professional_learning_link_header, link_type: "csd" %>
* CS Discoveries is an introductory computer science course
* It empowers students to create authentic artifacts and engage with computer science as a medium for creativity, communication, problem solving, and fun.
* The curriculum is recommended for middle and high school students (grades 6-10)
* Can be taught either as a semester or full-year offering.
<br/>

<%= view :professional_learning_link_header, link_type: "csp" %>
* Computer Science Principles (can be taught as an AP​®​ course)​ is also an introductory course that requires no computer science background (from students or teachers).
* We recommend it for students in grades 9-12 with stronger reading and writing skills.
* More than a traditional introduction to programming, it is a rigorous, engaging, and approachable course that explores many of the foundational ideas of computing so all students understand how these concepts are transforming the world we live in.

## Professional Learning Program features

<details>
  <summary>**Cost should not be a barrier**</summary>
  <p>
  <br>
We are a nonprofit dedicated to helping schools teach computer science. In most states, our professional learning is offered at *no cost to you or your school*.

In New York and North Carolina, there is a fee to cover the costs of the workshop. But, we have worked with many school districts in these regions and they have allocated funds to cover the costs for you and your school. If your principal or administration has any questions around the costs to support this, please encourage them to reach out to our partners in <a href="mailto:programs@codeinteractive.org">New York</a> and <a href="mailto:srmorri3@ncsu.edu">North Carolina</a> so we can help you.
</p>

<details>
  <summary>**One cohesive set of resources**</summary>
  <p>
  <br>
​Our professional learning and curriculum flow seamlessly together, empowering teachers to deliver the course with confidence. In-person workshops combine with online tools to provide participants with a broad selection of resources to help them plan ahead for implementing the course in their classrooms, while also collaborating with other educators.
</p>
</details>

<details>
 <summary>**Teaching and learning in context**</summary>
 <p>
 <br>
Participants will engage with the curriculum both as instructors and as learners. By experiencing the course content as an active learner, participants will gain important, concrete insight into the perspective their students will have during the academic year. By interacting with curriculum content as instructors, participants will learn how to plan and deliver lessons.
</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**A collaborative, participant-centric approach**</summary>
  <p>
  <br>
​Teachers and facilitators will have the opportunity to share their expertise from the field and collaborate on strategies to bring to the CS Principles and CS Discoveries classrooms, giving participants a chance to learn from everyone in the room. Facilitators model pedagogical strategies and participants share their own approaches by planning and delivering lessons.
​</p>
​</details>

**Summer Workshop:**

* Participants kick off the Professional Learning Program with a 5-day workshop
* Explore the curriculum and learning tools, discuss classroom management and teaching strategies, and build a community of teachers.
* With a focus on a customized experience, participants will develop skills while working in small groups to deepen their understanding of the materials.<br/>

**Ongoing Support, throughout following academic year:**  

* Participants attend local, 1-day quarterly workshops hosted by Code.org Regional Partners
* Usually held on Saturdays, these workshops are run by local Code.org-trained facilitators
* They focus on the essential elements of the course, such as teaching new content, keeping the classroom environment equitable and engaging, and continue to build pedagogical strategies.


In addition, all teachers have access to the Code.org forum, an online professional learning community that offers continued support with tools and content, introduces new and helpful resources for teaching the course, and lets teachers continue to explore the curriculum.
