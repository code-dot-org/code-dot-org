## Save on college tuition!

Many universities now count <strong>passing the AP CS Principles exam for course credit.</strong>

## Got your major picked out?

Passing an AP Exam can help you <strong>skip introductory courses</strong> so you can move to upper-level classes and focus on the work you're most interested in.

## No idea what your major will be?

Passing an AP Exam can help you **complete your college's general education requirements**, opening up more time for you to explore what you want to pursue.

## Worried you won't pass?

That's fine! **You don't need to report your test scores** to the colleges you apply to. Research shows that <a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED519365.pdf", target=_"blank">students who take an AP exam are more likely to graduate college</a>, even if they don't pass!

## Be a part of history!

Did you know that AP CS Principles is <a href="https://www.collegeboard.org/membership/all-access/counseling-admissions-academic/ap-computer-science-principles-participation", target=_"blank">one of the fastest growing AP exams</a> ever? And, the total number of young women and students from historically underrepresented minorities in AP computer science has grown ten-fold since 2013. **Be a part of this incredible movement - take the exam!**

## Need help paying for the exam?

Financial obligations shouldn't prevent you from taking an AP Exam. Talk with your teacher or your school's AP coordinator to learn about **financial assistance**.
