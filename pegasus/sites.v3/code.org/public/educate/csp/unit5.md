		<h3>Important notes about lessons and digital tools</h3>
		<ul>
				<li>To use the tools in this course and be able to see your students' progress, you will continue to use the section you set up for Units 1 - 4. When moving on to Unit 5, from the <a href="/teacher-dashboard#/sections">sections list</a> of the teacher dashboard, you can simply click the 'Edit' button for your section and toggle the Course dropdown to 'cspunit5'. You and your students will still be able to access their work from the previous unit.
				
				<li> When you go to <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit5">Unit 5 in Code Studio</a> each "stage" number corresponds to the lesson number.</li> 

				<li> Unlike other Code.org courses, lessons for CSP on Code Studio are <strong>not self-guided</strong>. They require specific structure and context provided by the classroom teacher through the lesson plan. 

				<li>  When exploring the curriculum, or preparing for a lesson, <strong>start with the lesson plan</strong>, which contains all of the necessary details and links for how and when to use the online tools.

				<li>The course on Code Studio is in beta, so it is subject to revision as feedback is received and improvements are made.
