# '15 - '16 Computer Science Principles Curriculum #

The materials below are from the '15-'16 Computer Science Principles pilot that Code.org is running with approximately 100 teachers across the US. Based on pilot teacher feedback, we are in the middle of making revisions to the material to condense, clarify, and re-order material. Until that material is re-released, please feel free to reference this material. Learn more about our [revision plans](https://docs.google.com/document/export?format=pdf&id=1ElvZenQSCigqBXKEHnXYRruck7umCJd699aippGCfLQ).

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** It is only the ['16-'17 syllabus and curriculum](/educate/csp) that is officially endorsed by the College Board and able to be submitted as a pre-approved syllabus for AP&reg; CS Principles  audit.

| Link | Unit Description |
| :------------------:|-----------|
|  [![binary magic](/educate/csp/images/thumb_binaryMagic.png "Unit 1")](/educate/csp/unit1) [Unit 1](/educate/csp/archive/unit1) | **Digital Information:** What can be represented with a single bit and how do we get a single bit of information from one place to another? This unit explores the technical challenges and questions that arise from the need to represent digital information in computers and transfer it between people and computational devices. Topics include: the digital representation of information - numbers, text, images, and communication protocols |
|  [![Internet Simulator](/educate/csp/images/thumb_netsim.png "Unit 2")](/educate/csp/unit2) [Unit 2](/educate/csp/archive/unit2)  | **The Internet:** Students continue to work together to invent solutions and protocols to many of the problems that arise in the structure and function of the Internet. Topics include the Internet Protocol, DNS, TCP/IP, cryptography, computationally hard problems, and other security and hacking concerns.
| [![App Lab](/educate/csp/images/thumb_applab.png "Unit 3")](/educate/csp/unit3) [Unit 3](/educate/csp/archive/unit3) | **Programming:** Students learn the fundamentals programming constructs of JavaScript by solving problems with “turtle graphics.”  Then move on to programming simple event driven apps.  An emphasis is placed on enabling students to solve problems and write code in teams. |
| [![binary magic](/educate/csp/images/thumb_graph.png "Unit 4")](/educate/csp/unit4) [Unit 4](/educate/csp/archive/unit4)| **Data:** Being able to digitally manipulate data, visualize it, identify patterns, trends and possible meanings are important practical skills that computer scientists do every day. The data rich world we live in also introduces many complex questions related to public policy, law, ethics and societal impact. Understanding where data comes from, having intuitions about what could be learned or extracted from it, and being able to use computational tools to manipulate data and communicate about it are the primary skills addressed in the unit.|
|[![binary magic](/educate/csp/images/thumb_app.png "Unit 5")](/educate/csp/unit5) [Unit 5](/educate/csp/archive/unit5)| **Explore and Create:** Class time devoted to preparation and execution of the AP® Performance Tasks: Explore and Create.|
|[![binary magic](/educate/csp/images/thumb_survey.png "Post-AP")](/educate/csp/postap) [Post-AP](/educate/csp/archive/postap)| **Databases in Apps:** This loosely-structured material includes new content which students can work through after the AP® test. The content includes skill-building levels about remote data storage and how to use App Lab's Data Tools to create data-backed apps.|

### Chat about CS Principles in the forum
We have forums for educators to discuss and trade ideas about CS Principles  and talk about the curriculum.  Code.org forums are used for all of our courses K-12 and can be found at [forum.code.org](http://forum.code.org).  For CS Principles  there are two forums that are most useful:

* [General CS Principles  forum](http://forum.code.org/c/csp)
* [Unit 1 Lesson-Specific Forums](http://forum.code.org/c/csp1)
* [Unit 2 Lesson-Specific Forums](http://forum.code.org/c/csp2)
* [Unit 3 Lesson-Specific Forums](http://forum.code.org/c/csp3)
* [Unit 4 Lesson-Specific Forums](http://forum.code.org/c/csp4)
