| Lesson Description| Lesson Plan | 
| ------------------|:-----------:|
| **Lesson 01 - The Need for Programming Languages** Students quickly recall the meaning of the word “algorithm” before moving into the day’s activity, building a small arrangement of LEGO® blocks and then creating text instructions a classmate could follow to construct the same arrangement. | [![lesson 1](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/1/Teacher) |
| **Lesson 02 - Using Simple Commands** This lesson is students’ first exposure to programming in the App Lab environment.  App Lab is embedded into Code Studio, and for this lesson students’ view is limited to only a very few simple “turtle” commands to draw graphics on the screen.  Using only combinations of four drawing commands, students must figure out the most “efficient” way to draw an image of a 3x3 grid.| [![lesson 2](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/2/Teacher)|
| **Lesson 03 - Creating Functions** In this lesson, students learn to define and call procedures (in JavaScript, procedures are called “functions”) in order to create and give a name to a group of commands for easy and repeated use in their code. They are introduced to functions as a form of abstraction that enables them to write code in larger, more logical chunks and focus on what something does, rather than how it does it. | [![lesson 3](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/3/Teacher)|
| **Lesson 04 - Functions and Top-Down Design** This lesson presents a top-down problem-solving strategy for designing solutions to programming problems. Students use a “top-down” problem-solving approach to identify sub-tasks of a larger programming task and then write a complete program with functions that solve sub-tasks of a larger programming task. | [![lesson 4](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/4/Teacher) |
| **Lesson 05 - APIs and using Functions with Parameters** Students learn to read App Lab’s API documentation and use functions that accept parameters in order to complete a series of drawing puzzles which require them to make use of the AppLab API documentation to learn new drawing commands. Many of these commands will require the use of parameters. | [![lesson 5](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/5/Teacher) |
| **Lesson 06 - Creating Functions with Parameters** Students practice using and creating functions with parameters. Students learn that writing functions with parameters can generalize solutions to problems even further. Students make a series of modifications to a program that creates an “Under the Sea” scene by adding parameters to functions to more easily add variation to the scene.| [![lesson 6](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/6/Teacher) |
| **Lesson 07 - Looping and Random Numbers** Students learn to use random values and looping to create variation in their drawings and quickly duplicate objects they wish to appear in their digital scenes many times. They build upon the "Under the sea" scene to create more complex backgrounds. | [![lesson 1](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/7/Teacher) |

| ------------------|:-----------:| :-----------:|
| **Lesson 8 - Practice PT - Design a Digital Scene** To conclude their introduction to programming, students design a program that draws a digital scene of their choosing. Students work in groups of 3 or 4 and begin by identifying a scene they wish to create. They then use Top-Down Design to identify the high-level functions necessary to create that image, and assign these components to individual members. After programming their individual portion, students combine all of their code to compose the whole scene. The project concludes with reflection questions similar to those students will see on the AP® Performance Tasks.  | [![lesson 8](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/8/Teacher) | [![U3 Assessment Student Guide](/educate/csp/images/thumb_activityGuide.png)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FI-_esPMKY9I455G75w0-X932aGJktrLCc16v1iCtlQ/edit?usp=sharing) |

| Lesson Description| Lesson Plan | 
| ------------------|:-----------:|
| **Lesson 09 - Events Unplugged** In this lesson, students participate in an activity in which they simulate many of the behaviors and challenges associated with “event-driven” programs. Synchronizing activity in an event-driven program can be a challenge since an “event,” such as a user clicking a button, an animation timer, or data returning from a remote database request, can happen at any moment and take unpredictable amounts of time.| [![lesson 9](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/9/Teacher) |
| **Lesson 10 - Event-Driven Programming and Debugging** In this lesson, students have their first experience developing a simple user interface and defining its behavior through the use of event-driven programming. Students are introduced to the ability to place buttons on the screen and define their behavior through the use of event handlers. | [![lesson 1](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/10/Teacher) | 
| **Lesson 11 - Beyond Buttons Toward Apps** Students expand their understanding by experimenting with new event types and screen elements, combining these skills to make a simple “chaser” game. This lesson transitions away from using the turtle, as students explore different event types (e.g. “mouseover” and “mouseout”) and are introduced to other user interface elements they can add to their apps, like text labels and images. | [![lesson 11](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/11/Teacher) | 
| **Lesson 12 - Introducing Design Mode** Students are introduced to a new feature of App Lab: Design Mode. Design Mode allows students to easily design the User Interface (UI) of their apps using a drag-and-drop editor. Students learn how to create UI elements they have seen before such as images, text labels and buttons, but they see many more options for styling these elements with colors, font sizes and so on. In addition students see how to add multiple “screens” to their app and how to add sound to their games.| [![lesson 12](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/12/Teacher) | 
| **Lesson 13 - Multi-screen Apps** This lesson gives students time to familiarize themselves with the process of making event-driven apps before moving on to deeper content.  They design and create a (minimum) 4-screen app on a topic of their choosing. | [![lesson 1](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/13/Teacher) | 
| **Lesson 14 - Controlling Memory with Variables** This lesson gets into the basic mechanics of working with variables in programs.  The lesson shows students how to create and assign values to variables and navigates through a series of common misconceptions about variables and how they work.  Along the way the lesson tries to build up the student’s mental model of how computers and programs work that is essential for being able to reason about programs. | [![lesson 14](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/14/Teacher)| 
| **Lesson 15 - Using Variables in Apps** In this lesson students add variables to two different exemplar apps to keep track of a score, or a count of some number of button clicks.  The major topic is variable scope and understanding the differences, benefits, and drawbacks, of using global versus local variables.  This lesson focuses more on using global variables since in event-driven apps that’s what you need to keep track of data across multiple events. | [![lesson 15](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/15/Teacher)|
|**Lesson 16 - User Input and Strings** Students are introduced to the string data type as a way of representing arbitrary sequences of ASCII characters. They use strings to accept input from a user as they work on mastering two new UI elements, the text input and the text area. Students combine these skills to develop a simple Mad Lib App.| [![lesson 16](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/16/Teacher) |
|**Lesson 17 - Introduction to Digital Assistant Project** Students analyze digital assistants in order to understand the underlying key features of the natural language processing (NLP) algorithms that allow them to appear to have intelligent conversations. They then begin to design the components of a simple digital assistant of their own they will be building over the subsequent lessons. | [![lesson 17](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/17/Teacher) |
|**Lesson 18 - Understanding Program Flow and Logic** Students program game decisions using conditional statements and boolean expressions. The lesson begins with a discussion on how statements are determined to be true/false in real life, and then how that is different in a computer.  Students practice thinking about decision making using flow charts.  They apply this to create two games. A ‘Guess My Number’ game and a Dice game.| [![lesson 18](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/18/Teacher) |
|**Lesson 19 - Introduction to Conditional Logic** Having explored the basics of conditional statements in the previous lesson students return to the Movie Bot digital assistant example in order to improve its functionality with conditional logic.  | [![lesson 19](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/19/Teacher) |
|**Lesson 20 - Compound Conditional Logic** Students are introduced to the logic operators NOT, AND, and OR as tools for simplifying the expression of complex boolean conditions. Students learn how to improve nested or chained conditionals through the use of these logical operations and then use them to make additions to the functionality of the Movie Bot. | [![lesson 20](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/20/Teacher) |
|**Lesson 21 - Digital Assistant Project** In this lesson, students complete the digital assistant project in which they synthesize their abilities to write string functions and complex conditionals. This lesson is designed to allow students to hone their programming skills through the lens of creativity and innovation. Students continue to work on their digital assistant and analyze their work and reflect using questions similar to those of the create performance task.| [![lesson 21](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/21/Teacher) |
| **Lesson 22 - While Loops** This lesson demonstrates how a slight manipulation of a conditional statement can allow for the creation of a new and powerful tool in constructing programs, a while loop. Students are introduced to a while loop by analyzing the flow chart of a conditional statement in which the "true" branch leads back to the original condition.|[![lesson 22](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/22/Teacher)  |
| **Lesson 23 - Looping and Simulation** In this lesson students gain more practice using while loops as they develop a simulation that repeatedly flips coins until certain conditions are met.|[![lesson 23](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/23/Teacher) | 
| **Lesson 24 - Introduction to Arrays** This lesson introduces arrays as a means of storing lists of information within a program. The class begins by highlighting the difficulties that arise when trying to store lists on information in a variable. Students then practice using arrays in their programs.|[![lesson 24](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/24/Teacher) | 
| **Lesson 25 - Image Scroller with Key Events** Students will extend the “My Favorite Things” app they built in the previous lesson so that it now manages and displays a collection of images and responds to key events. Students are introduced to the practice of refactoring code in order to keep programs consistent and remove redundancies when adding new functionality.|[![lesson 25](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/25/Teacher)  | 
| **Lesson 26 - Processing Arrays**  Thuis lesson introduces students to algorithms that process lists of data. The for loop is re-introduced to implement these algorithms because it’s straightforward to use to process all the elements of a list, and students practice writing programs using a for loop to visit every index in an array.|[![lesson 26](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/26/Teacher)| 
| **Lesson 27 - Functions with Return Values** In this lesson students are introduced to the “return” command and learn to write their own functions that return values. Students first complete a simple unplugged activity based on the game Go Fish to introduce the concept of a return value. By the end of the lesson, students write and use functions that return values in a simple turtle driver app.|[![lesson 27](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/27/Teacher) | 
| **Lesson 28 - Canvas and Arrays in Apps** Students continue to practice working with arrays and are introduced to a new user interface element, the canvas. The canvas includes commands for drawing simple geometric shapes (circles, rectangles, lines) and also triggers mouse and key events like any other user interface element. Over the course of the lesson students combine these features to make an app that allows a user to draw an image while recording every dot drawn on the canvas in an array. By processing this array in different ways the app will allow students to redraw their image in different styles, like random, spray paint, and sketching.| [![lesson 28](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/28/Teacher) |

|  **Lesson 29 - Practice PT - Create** To conclude their introduction to programming, students will design an app based off of one they have previously worked on in the programming unit. Students will choose the kinds of improvements they wish to make to a past project in order to show their ability to make abstractions and implement complex algorithms. The project concludes with reflection questions similar to those students will see on the AP Performance Tasks. Students can either complete the project individually or with a partner. Every student will need a collaborative partner to give and receive feedback from.| [![lesson 29](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/29/Teacher) | [![U3 Assessment Student Guide](/educate/csp/images/thumb_activityGuide.png)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1twNRho-TKg39u1B6qz4AbJy4A6bHLJ4U1tByCFpM0cE) |
