| Lesson Description| Lesson Plan | 
| ------------------|:-----------:|
| **Lesson 01 - The Internet Is For Everyone** Students read portions of a memo entitled “The Internet is for Everyone”, a call-to-arms which highlights the benefits of a free and open Internet and identifies threats to this system. Students select individual threats to the openness of the Internet and relate them to their own experiences. | [![lesson 1](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit2/1/Teacher) |
| **Lesson 02 - The Need for Addressing** Students play a simplified game of Battleship, first unplugged and then in a version of the Internet Simulator in which all students can see each other’s messages. Students must devise a messaging protocol that makes it clear who is sending the message and who the intended recipient is.| [![lesson 2](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit2/2/Teacher)|
| **Lesson 03 - Invent an Addressing Protocol** Building upon the Battleship activity from the previous lesson, this lesson asks students to invent a communication protocol and describe its binary encoding. Students discuss the requirements of an addressing protocol and discuss why IP addresses must be of a fixed length. | [![lesson 3](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit2/3/Teacher)|
| **Lesson 04 - Routers and Redundancy** Students use a version the Internet Simulator to communicate with classmates by IP address.  The simulator records traffic both at the router level and across a network of routers, which will allow students to examine the traffic they generate from conducting short conversations with friends. They will consider that messages may visit many routers when travelling to a friend, that messages may not always take the same path, and that the routers (and their owners) can see all of this traffic.| [![lesson 4](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit2/4/Teacher) |
| **Lesson 05 - Packets and Making a Reliable Internet** Students use a version of the Internet Simulator which simulates the unreliability of the Internet and challenges them to develop a protocol which overcomes these flaws to ensure reliable communication. | [![lesson 5](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit2/5/Teacher) |
| **Lesson 06 - Algorithms Detour - Minimum Spanning Tree** Students will explore and solve the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem, first, in an unplugged fashion on paper. Students work to develop an algorithm, that, if followed properly, will solve any instance of the problem.| [![lesson 6](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit2/6/Teacher) |
| **Lesson 07 - Algorithms Detour - Shortest Path** In this lesson students will explore the Single Source Shortest Path problem, by solving the problem with pencil and paper first, then by following a famous algorithm that solves the shortest path problem known as Dijkstra’s Algorithm.  This lesson also introduces ideas about how we analyze algorithms: looking for correctness, efficiency and running time.| [![lesson 1](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit2/7/Teacher) | 
| **Lesson 08 - How Routers Learn** Building off of the previous lesson about shortest path algorithms, the activity in this lesson shows how routers learn about the rest of the Internet in order to route traffic so it takes the shortest path. Students simulate the process of a router joining a network and generating a router table that would allow them to send packets to anyone else in their network as efficiently as possible. | [![lesson 8](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit2/8/Teacher) | 
| **Lesson 09 - The Need for DNS** In this lesson, students begin with the problem of trying to create a list of IP addresses and names for a list of constantly changing sets of data. Students will explore the DNS protocol in the Internet Simulator in order to experience the process a computer uses any time it attempts to retrieve a page or other information on the Internet.| [![lesson 9](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit2/9/Teacher) |
| **Lesson 10 - DNS in the Real World** In this lesson, students identify the similarities between DNS and the postal service, focusing on their hierarchical structure. They then explore stories from the news about DNS and some of the vulnerabilities of the system. | [![lesson 1](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit2/10/Teacher) | 
| **Lesson 11 - HTTP and Abstraction on the Internet** In this lesson students are introduced to high-level protocols of the Internet, most notably HTTP. Students will investigate HTTP traffic generated within their own browser by accessing the browser’s developer tools and visiting a variety of websites. | [![lesson 11](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit2/11/Teacher) |

| ------------------|:-----------:| :-----------:|
| **Lesson 12 - Practice PT - Global Impacts of the Internet** This lesson is a capstone to the first half of the Internet unit. Students will complete an abbreviated version of the Explore Performance Task. Students will practice synthesizing information, writing a short opinion essay, and presenting their learning in a flash talk.| [![lesson 12](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit2/12/Teacher) | [![U2 Assessment Student Guide](/educate/csp/images/thumb_activityGuide.png)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_oOR3HZIvmy7VptZuosUmCB8kCsOg8FtQVbAzgSe6KI/edit) |

| **Lesson 13 - The Need for Encryption** In this lesson, students are introduced to the need for encryption and simple techniques for breaking (or cracking) secret messages.  Students do a guided reading of a short section of Blown to Bits and answer some questions. Then students try their own hand at cracking a message encoded with the classic Caesar cipher. | [![lesson 1](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit2/13/Teacher) | 
| **Lesson 14 - Cracking the Code** In this lesson, students crack the random substitution cipher, complete a short reading in Blown to Bits, and begin an exploration of the use of keys in encryption techniques through an exploration of the Vigenère cipher.| [![lesson 14](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit2/14/Teacher)| 
| **Lesson 15 - Keys and Passwords** Students look at the relationship between encryption keys and the passwords they use in everyday life.  Students experiment with what makes a good password and answer questions about the “human components” of cybersecurity. Finally, students watch a video which both reviews topics of cybersecurity and “how not to get hacked”.| [![lesson 15](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit2/15/Teacher)|
|**Lesson 16 - Hard Problems - The Traveling Salesperson Problem** In this lesson, students examine a classic problem in computer science, the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP).  Students see how the TSP grows in size much faster than the problem of adding characters to a password. This lesson covers some territory about how we reason formally and mathematically about algorithms and figuring out how “hard” something is for a computer to do. | [![lesson 16](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit2/16/Teacher) |
|**Lesson 17 - One Way Functions - The WiFi Hotspot Problem** In this lesson, students continue their exploration of computationally hard problems as they investigate a one-way function, a problem which is easy to construct in such a way that you know the solution but computationally hard to solve. Students are introduced to the concept of a one-way function and consider why such problems might be useful tools when constructing methods of encryption. | [![lesson 16](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit2/17/Teacher) |
|**Lesson 18 - Asymmetric Keys - Cups and Beans** This lesson introduces the concept of asymmetric keys that are foundational to public key cryptography. Students use cups and beans to model a method for sending a “secret number” to a partner, without having to come up with a shared secret key ahead of time. | [![lesson 16](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit2/18/Teacher) |
|**Lesson 19 - Public Key Cryptography** In this lesson students learn the mathematical principles that underlie modern public key encryption and make asymmetric keys possible.  Students act out the information exchange procedure they did with cups and beans, only this time using numbers with multiplication and division (modulo) to show how these can act as one way functions. | [![lesson 16](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit2/19/Teacher) |

| **Lesson 20 - Practice performance task - Security and Hacking in the Real World** Cyber threats are all around us as criminals exploit the Internet to commit cyber crimes. In this lesson, students will create a visual artifact to inform others about a cybersecurity topic of their choice. They will then examine it with a critical eye to demonstrate a deep understanding of the issue, its functionality, and its impact or potential for impact on people and society.|  [![U2 Assessment Lesson Plan](/educate/csp/images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit2/20/Teacher) | [![U2 Assessment Student Guide](/educate/csp/images/thumb_activityGuide.png)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dRKb0r1C6ppj3j43j52cJCUTo4lneJveWnqsbmmT5sM/edit) |
