		<h3>Important notes about lessons and digital tools</h3>
		<ul>
				<li>To use the tools in this course and be able to see your students' progress, you will continue to use the section you set up for Units 1 - 3. When moving on to Unit 4, from the <a href="/teacher-dashboard#/sections">sections list</a> of the teacher dashboard, you can simply click the 'Edit' button for your section and toggle the Course dropdown to 'cspunit4'. You and your students will still be able to access their work from the previous unit.
				
				<li> When you go to <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit4">Unit 4 in Code Studio</a> each "stage" number corresponds to the lesson number.</li> 

				<li> Unlike other Code.org courses, lessons for CSP on Code Studio are <strong>not self-guided</strong>. They require specific structure and context provided by the classroom teacher through the lesson plan. 

				<li>  When exploring the curriculum, or preparing for a lesson, <strong>start with the lesson plan</strong>, which contains all of the necessary details and links for how and when to use the online tools.

				<li>The course on Code Studio is in beta, so it is subject to revision as feedback is received and improvements are made.

| ------------------|:-----------:|
| **Lesson 01 - Intro to Data** In this kickoff to the Data Unit, students begin thinking about how data is collected and what can be learned from it. To begin the lesson, students will take a short online quiz that supposedly determines something interesting or funny about their personality. Afterwards they will brainstorm other sources of data in the world around them, leading to a discussion of how that data is collected. This discussion motivates the introduction of the Class Data Tracker project that will run through the first half of this unit. | [![lesson 1](images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit4/1/Teacher) |
| **Lesson 02 - Finding Trends with Visualizations** Students use the Google Trends tool in order to visualize historical search data. They will need to identify interesting trends or patterns in their findings and will attempt to explain those trends based on their own experience or through further research online. Afterwards students will present their findings to ensure they are correctly identifying patterns in a visualization and are providing plausible explanations of those patterns.| [![lesson 2](images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit4/2/Teacher)|
| **Lesson 03 - Check Your Assumptions** This lesson asks students to consider carefully the assumptions they make when interpreting data and data visualizations. The class begins by examining how the Google Flu Trends project tried and failed to use search trends to predict flu outbreaks. They will then read a report on the Digital Divide which highlights how access to technology differs widely by personal characteristics like race and income. This report challenges a widespread assumption that data collected online is representative of the population at large.  | [![lesson 3](images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit4/3/Teacher)|
| **Lesson 04 - Good and Bad Data Visualizations** Visualization is useful for both discovery of connections and trends and also communication.  In this lesson we will focus on the communication aspects of visualization. First students review and read about some basic principles of good data visualizations. Second, students will look at some collections of (mostly bad) data visualizations, rate them, explain why a good one is effective, and also suggest a fix for a bad one.  | [![lesson 4](images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit4/4/Teacher) |
| **Lesson 05 - Making Data Visualizations** Now that students have had the chance to see and evaluate various data visualizations, they will learn to make visualizations of their own. In this lesson, students to build different chart types (scatter, line, and bar charts) from a single data set. The purpose of this lesson is to explore and experiment with creating different types of visualizations, not to build the perfect chart. | [![lesson 5](images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit4/5/Teacher) |
| **Lesson 06 - Discover a Data Story** In this lesson students will collaboratively investigate some data sets and use visualization tools to “discover a data story.”  Using a data visualization tool such as a spreadsheet program, students will work with the data, discover a trend, make a chart, and accurately write about it.| [![lesson 6](images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit4/6/Teacher) |
| **Lesson 07 - Cleaning Data** In this lesson, students begin working with the data that they have been collecting since the first lesson of the unit. They are introduced to the first step in analyzing data: cleaning the data. Students will correct errors they find in the data by either hand-correcting invalid values or deleting them. Finally they will categorize any free-text columns that were collected to prepare them for analysis. This lesson introduces many new skills with spreadsheets and reveals the sometimes subjective nature of data analysis.| [![lesson 1](images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit4/7/Teacher) |
| **Lesson 08 - Creating Summary Tables** In this lesson students learn how create their own summary tables from raw data.  A summary table typically represents one or more aggregations (groupings of items) and computations that are performed on the raw dataset.  In most spreadsheet programs, a summary table is called a pivot table.  In the lesson, students learn how to make pivot tables using a provided dataset.  Then students turn to the data they’ve collected as a class and, with their partner, use pivot tables to investigate it further.| [![lesson 8](images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit4/8/Teacher) |

| **Lesson 9 - Practice PT - Tell a Data Story** For this Practice PT students will analyze the data that they have been collecting as a class in order to demonstrate their ability to discover, visualize, and present a trend or pattern they find in the data. Leading up to this lesson students will have been working in pairs to clean and summarize their data. Students should complete this project individually but can get feedback on their ideas from their partner who should know how the data was cleaned. | [![lesson 9](images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit4/9/Teacher) | [![U4 Assessment Student Guide](images/thumb_activityGuide.png)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HVUQhwuuKC5IejdUabA4FGS2xfjXMrRvKy0wJSnP8uU) |

| **Lesson 10 - What is Big Data?** In this lesson students are introduced to the concept of Big Data, where it comes from, what makes it “big”, and how people use Big Data to solve problems. Students are asked to consider how much of their lives are “datafied” or could be, and the teacher will show the projected growth of data in the world. Students will then investigate a big data tool in pairs to evaluate the tool for its usefulness and investigate the source of the data used to make the tool. | [![lesson 10](images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit4/10/Teacher) | 
| **Lesson 11 - Rapid Research: Data Innovations** In this lesson students will conduct a small amount of research to explore a computing innovation that leverages the use of data.  Students will research a topic of personal interest and respond to questions about about how that innovation produces, uses or consumes data.  The lesson is intended to give students practice with doing research of this nature and provides a small amount of scaffolding to help students figure out what to look for. | [![lesson 11](images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit4/11/Teacher) | 
| **Lesson 12 - Identifying People With Data** Students begin this lesson by investigating some of the world’s biggest data breaches to get a sense for how frequently data breaches happen within companies and organizations, and what kinds of data and information is lost or given up. Afterwards students will use the Data Privacy Lab tool to investigate just how easily they could be uniquely identified with a few seemingly innocuous pieces of information. At the conclusion of the lesson students will research themselves online to determine just how much someone could learn about them by conducting the same searches and “connecting the dots.”| [![lesson 12](images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit4/12/Teacher) | 
| **Lesson 13 - The Cost of "Free"** This lesson focuses on the economic and consumer concerns around apps and websites that collect and track data about you in exchange for providing you a service free of cost.  Often the quality of the service itself is dependent on having access to data about many people and their behavior. The main take-away of the lesson is that students should be more informed consumers of the technology around them.  They should be able to explain some of the tradeoffs between maintaining personal privacy and using innovative software free of cost.| [![lesson 1](images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit4/13/Teacher) |

|  **Lesson 14 - Practice PT - Propose an Innovation** To conclude the unit students will propose a technological solution that could address a need or problem. Prior to designing their own solution students will conduct research to learn how their problem is currently being addressed. Afterwards they will propose their own technological solution that could be used to address this problem. In doing so they must specifically account for what data their innovation will produce and consume and the privacy and security concerns that arise as a result.| [![lesson 14](images/thumb_lesson1.png)](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit4/14/Teacher) | [![U4 Assessment Student Guide](images/thumb_activityGuide.png)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b5EhBSRFyZbcb2E5tg0-TrkdOijAPMefrSrYFMa0s4o) |
