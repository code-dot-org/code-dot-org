## Unit 3


| Lesson Description| Lesson Plan | 
| ------------------|:-----------:|
| **Events Unplugged** In this lesson, students participate in an activity in which they simulate many of the behaviors and challenges associated with “event-driven” programs. Synchronizing activity in an event-driven program can be a challenge since an “event,” such as a user clicking a button, an animation timer, or data returning from a remote database request, can happen at any moment and take unpredictable amounts of time.| <ul><li>[Lesson Plan](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/9/Teacher)</li><li>[Code Studio Stage](https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit3/stage/9/puzzle/1/)</li></ul> |
|  **Event-Driven Programming and Debugging** In this lesson, students have their first experience developing a simple user interface and defining its behavior through the use of event-driven programming. Students are introduced to the ability to place buttons on the screen and define their behavior through the use of event handlers. | <ul><li>[Lesson Plan](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/10/Teacher)</li><li>[Code Studio Stage](https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit3/stage/10/puzzle/1/)</li></ul> | 
|  **Beyond Buttons Toward Apps** Students expand their understanding by experimenting with new event types and screen elements, combining these skills to make a simple “chaser” game. This lesson transitions away from using the turtle, as students explore different event types (e.g. “mouseover” and “mouseout”) and are introduced to other user interface elements they can add to their apps, like text labels and images. |<ul><li>[Lesson Plan](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/11/Teacher)</li><li>[Code Studio Stage](https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit3/stage/11/puzzle/1/)</li></ul> | 
|  **Introducing Design Mode** Students are introduced to a new feature of App Lab: Design Mode. Design Mode allows students to easily design the User Interface (UI) of their apps using a drag-and-drop editor. Students learn how to create UI elements they have seen before such as images, text labels and buttons, but they see many more options for styling these elements with colors, font sizes and so on. In addition students see how to add multiple “screens” to their app and how to add sound to their games.| <ul><li>[Lesson Plan](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/12/Teacher)</li><li>[Code Studio Stage](https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit3/stage/12/puzzle/1/)</li></ul> | 
|  **Multi-screen Apps** This lesson gives students time to familiarize themselves with the process of making event-driven apps before moving on to deeper content.  They design and create a (minimum) 4-screen app on a topic of their choosing. | <ul><li>[Lesson Plan](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/13/Teacher)</li><li>[Code Studio Stage](https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit3/stage/13/puzzle/1/)</li></ul> | 
|  **Controlling Memory with Variables** This lesson gets into the basic mechanics of working with variables in programs.  The lesson shows students how to create and assign values to variables and navigates through a series of common misconceptions about variables and how they work.  Along the way the lesson tries to build up the student’s mental model of how computers and programs work that is essential for being able to reason about programs. | <ul><li>[Lesson Plan](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/14/Teacher)</li><li>[Code Studio Stage](https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit3/stage/14/puzzle/1/)</li></ul>| 
|  **Using Variables in Apps** In this lesson students add variables to two different exemplar apps to keep track of a score, or a count of some number of button clicks.  The major topic is variable scope and understanding the differences, benefits, and drawbacks, of using global versus local variables.  This lesson focuses more on using global variables since in event-driven apps that’s what you need to keep track of data across multiple events. | <ul><li>[Lesson Plan](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/15/Teacher)</li><li>[Code Studio Stage](https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit3/stage/15/puzzle/1/)</li></ul>|
| **User Input and Strings** Students are introduced to the string data type as a way of representing arbitrary sequences of ASCII characters. They use strings to accept input from a user as they work on mastering two new UI elements, the text input and the text area. Students combine these skills to develop a simple Mad Lib App.| <ul><li>[Lesson Plan](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/16/Teacher)</li><li>[Code Studio Stage](https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit3/stage/16/puzzle/1/)</li></ul> |
| **Introduction to Digital Assistant Project** Students analyze digital assistants in order to understand the underlying key features of the natural language processing (NLP) algorithms that allow them to appear to have intelligent conversations. They then begin to design the components of a simple digital assistant of their own they will be building over the subsequent lessons. | <ul><li>[Lesson Plan](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/17/Teacher)</li><li>[Code Studio Stage](https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit3/stage/17/puzzle/1/)</li></ul>|
| **Understanding Program Flow and Logic** Students program game decisions using conditional statements and boolean expressions. The lesson begins with a discussion on how statements are determined to be true/false in real life, and then how that is different in a computer.  Students practice thinking about decision making using flow charts.  They apply this to create two games. A ‘Guess My Number’ game and a Dice game.| <ul><li>[Lesson Plan](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/18/Teacher)</li><li>[Code Studio Stage](https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit3/stage/18/puzzle/1/)</li></ul>|
| **Introduction to Conditional Logic** Having explored the basics of conditional statements in the previous lesson students return to the Movie Bot digital assistant example in order to improve its functionality with conditional logic.  |<ul><li>[Lesson Plan](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/19/Teacher)</li><li>[Code Studio Stage](https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit3/stage/19/puzzle/1/)</li></ul> |
| **Compound Conditional Logic** Students are introduced to the logic operators NOT, AND, and OR as tools for simplifying the expression of complex boolean conditions. Students learn how to improve nested or chained conditionals through the use of these logical operations and then use them to make additions to the functionality of the Movie Bot. | <ul><li>[Lesson Plan](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/20/Teacher)</li><li>[Code Studio Stage](https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit3/stage/20/puzzle/1/)</li></ul>|
| **Digital Assistant Project** In this lesson, students complete the digital assistant project in which they synthesize their abilities to write string functions and complex conditionals. This lesson is designed to allow students to hone their programming skills through the lens of creativity and innovation. Students continue to work on their digital assistant and analyze their work and reflect using questions similar to those of the create performance task.| <ul><li>[Lesson Plan](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/21/Teacher)</li><li>[Code Studio Stage](https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit3/stage/21/puzzle/1/)</li></ul> |
|  **While Loops** This lesson demonstrates how a slight manipulation of a conditional statement can allow for the creation of a new and powerful tool in constructing programs, a while loop. Students are introduced to a while loop by analyzing the flow chart of a conditional statement in which the "true" branch leads back to the original condition.|<ul><li>[Lesson Plan](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/22/Teacher)</li><li>[Code Studio Stage](https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit3/stage/22/puzzle/1/)</li></ul>  |
|  **Looping and Simulation** In this lesson students gain more practice using while loops as they develop a simulation that repeatedly flips coins until certain conditions are met.|<ul><li>[Lesson Plan](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/23/Teacher)</li><li>[Code Studio Stage](https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit3/stage/23/puzzle/1/)</li></ul> | 
|  **Introduction to Arrays** This lesson introduces arrays as a means of storing lists of information within a program. The class begins by highlighting the difficulties that arise when trying to store lists on information in a variable. Students then practice using arrays in their programs.|<ul><li>[Lesson Plan](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/24/Teacher)</li><li>[Code Studio Stage](https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit3/stage/24/puzzle/1/)</li></ul>| 
|  **Image Scroller with Key Events** Students will extend the “My Favorite Things” app they built in the previous lesson so that it now manages and displays a collection of images and responds to key events. Students are introduced to the practice of refactoring code in order to keep programs consistent and remove redundancies when adding new functionality.|<ul><li>[Lesson Plan](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/25/Teacher)</li><li>[Code Studio Stage](https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit3/stage/25/puzzle/1/)</li></ul> | 
|  **Processing Arrays**  Thuis lesson introduces students to algorithms that process lists of data. The for loop is re-introduced to implement these algorithms because it’s straightforward to use to process all the elements of a list, and students practice writing programs using a for loop to visit every index in an array.|<ul><li>[Lesson Plan](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/26/Teacher)</li><li>[Code Studio Stage](https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit3/stage/26/puzzle/1/)</li></ul>| 
|  **Functions with Return Values** In this lesson students are introduced to the “return” command and learn to write their own functions that return values. Students first complete a simple unplugged activity based on the game Go Fish to introduce the concept of a return value. By the end of the lesson, students write and use functions that return values in a simple turtle driver app.|<ul><li>[Lesson Plan](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/27/Teacher)</li><li>[Code Studio Stage](https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit3/stage/27/puzzle/1/)</li></ul> | 
|  **Canvas and Arrays in Apps** Students continue to practice working with arrays and are introduced to a new user interface element, the canvas. The canvas includes commands for drawing simple geometric shapes (circles, rectangles, lines) and also triggers mouse and key events like any other user interface element. Over the course of the lesson students combine these features to make an app that allows a user to draw an image while recording every dot drawn on the canvas in an array. By processing this array in different ways the app will allow students to redraw their image in different styles, like random, spray paint, and sketching.| <ul><li>[Lesson Plan](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/28/Teacher)</li><li>[Code Studio Stage](https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit3/stage/28/puzzle/1/)</li></ul>|

| ------------------|:-----------:| :-----------:|
|   **Practice PT - Create** To conclude their introduction to programming, students will design an app based off of one they have previously worked on in the programming unit. Students will choose the kinds of improvements they wish to make to a past project in order to show their ability to make abstractions and implement complex algorithms. The project concludes with reflection questions similar to those students will see on the AP Performance Tasks. Students can either complete the project individually or with a partner. Every student will need a collaborative partner to give and receive feedback from.| [Assessment lesson plan](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit3/29/Teacher) | [Assessment Student Guide](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1twNRho-TKg39u1B6qz4AbJy4A6bHLJ4U1tByCFpM0cE) |
