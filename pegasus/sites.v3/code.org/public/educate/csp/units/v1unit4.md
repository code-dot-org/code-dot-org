# Computer Science Principles Lessons #

## v1 Unit 4

In response to feedback from our 2015-2016 pilot teachers, we are reordering, condensing, and clarifying lesson content. You can learn more about the updates [here](https://docs.google.com/document/export?format=pdf&id=1ElvZenQSCigqBXKEHnXYRruck7umCJd699aippGCfLQ). Unit 4 of the 2016-2017 curriculum is **'Big Data and Privacy'**, which represents merging the related ideas about big data and its implications along with how modern data encryption works.

The table below shows the sequence of lessons in this unit. The lessons linked in the table are lessons from the '15-'16 version of the curriculum and will undergo a revisions pass by October 1. If you need to teach this unit prior to October 1, we still recommend using the original lessons in the order presented below, as the core content will not be changing during the revisions pass.

| Lesson Description| Links | 
| ------------------|:-----------:|
| **What is Big Data?** In this lesson students are introduced to the concept of Big Data, where it comes from, what makes it “big”, and how people use Big Data to solve problems. Students are asked to consider how much of their lives are “datafied” or could be, and the teacher will show the projected growth of data in the world. Students will then investigate a big data tool in pairs to evaluate the tool for its usefulness and investigate the source of the data used to make the tool. |<ul><li>[Lesson Plan](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit4/10/Teacher)</li><li>[Code Studio Stage](https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit4/stage/10/puzzle/1/)</li></ul> | 
| **Rapid Research: Data Innovations** In this lesson students will conduct a small amount of research to explore a computing innovation that leverages the use of data.  Students will research a topic of personal interest and respond to questions about about how that innovation produces, uses or consumes data.  The lesson is intended to give students practice with doing research of this nature and provides a small amount of scaffolding to help students figure out what to look for. | <ul><li>[Lesson Plan](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit4/11/Teacher)</li><li>[Code Studio Stage](https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit4/stage/11/puzzle/1/)</li></ul> | 
| **Identifying People With Data** Students begin this lesson by investigating some of the world’s biggest data breaches to get a sense for how frequently data breaches happen within companies and organizations, and what kinds of data and information is lost or given up. Afterwards students will use the Data Privacy Lab tool to investigate just how easily they could be uniquely identified with a few seemingly innocuous pieces of information. At the conclusion of the lesson students will research themselves online to determine just how much someone could learn about them by conducting the same searches and “connecting the dots.”| <ul><li>[Lesson Plan](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit4/12/Teacher)</li><li>[Code Studio Stage](https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit4/stage/12/puzzle/1/)</li></ul> | 
| **The Cost of "Free"** This lesson focuses on the economic and consumer concerns around apps and websites that collect and track data about you in exchange for providing you a service free of cost.  Often the quality of the service itself is dependent on having access to data about many people and their behavior. The main take-away of the lesson is that students should be more informed consumers of the technology around them.  They should be able to explain some of the tradeoffs between maintaining personal privacy and using innovative software free of cost.| <ul><li>[Lesson Plan](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit4/13/Teacher)</li><li>[Code Studio Stage](https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit4/stage/13/puzzle/1/)</li></ul> |
| **The Need for Encryption** In this lesson, students are introduced to the need for encryption and simple techniques for breaking (or cracking) secret messages.  Students do a guided reading of a short section of Blown to Bits and answer some questions. Then students try their own hand at cracking a message encoded with the classic Caesar cipher. | <ul><li>[Lesson Plan](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit2/13/Teacher)</li><li>[Code Studio Stage](https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit2/stage/13/puzzle/1/)</li></ul> | 
| **Cracking the Code** In this lesson, students crack the random substitution cipher, complete a short reading in Blown to Bits, and begin an exploration of the use of keys in encryption techniques through an exploration of the Vigenère cipher.| <ul><li>[Lesson Plan](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit2/14/Teacher)</li><li>[Code Studio Stage](https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit2/stage/14/puzzle/1/)</li></ul>| 
| **Keys and Passwords** Students look at the relationship between encryption keys and the passwords they use in everyday life.  Students experiment with what makes a good password and answer questions about the “human components” of cybersecurity. Finally, students watch a video which both reviews topics of cybersecurity and “how not to get hacked”.| <ul><li>[Lesson Plan](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit2/15/Teacher)</li><li>[Code Studio Stage](https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit2/stage/15/puzzle/1/)</li></ul>|
|**Hard Problems - The Traveling Salesperson Problem** In this lesson, students examine a classic problem in computer science, the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP).  Students see how the TSP grows in size much faster than the problem of adding characters to a password. This lesson covers some territory about how we reason formally and mathematically about algorithms and figuring out how “hard” something is for a computer to do. | <ul><li>[Lesson Plan](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit2/16/Teacher)</li><li>[Code Studio Stage](https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit2/stage/16/puzzle/1/)</li></ul> |
|**One Way Functions - The WiFi Hotspot Problem** In this lesson, students continue their exploration of computationally hard problems as they investigate a one-way function, a problem which is easy to construct in such a way that you know the solution but computationally hard to solve. Students are introduced to the concept of a one-way function and consider why such problems might be useful tools when constructing methods of encryption. | <ul><li>[Lesson Plan](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit2/17/Teacher)</li><li>[Code Studio Stage](https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit2/stage/17/puzzle/1/)</li></ul> |
|**Asymmetric Keys - Cups and Beans** This lesson introduces the concept of asymmetric keys that are foundational to public key cryptography. Students use cups and beans to model a method for sending a “secret number” to a partner, without having to come up with a shared secret key ahead of time. | <ul><li>[Lesson Plan](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit2/18/Teacher)</li><li>[Code Studio Stage](https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit2/stage/18/puzzle/1/)</li></ul> |
|**Public Key Cryptography** In this lesson students learn the mathematical principles that underlie modern public key encryption and make asymmetric keys possible.  Students act out the information exchange procedure they did with cups and beans, only this time using numbers with multiplication and division (modulo) to show how these can act as one way functions. | <ul><li>[Lesson Plan](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit2/19/Teacher)</li><li>[Code Studio Stage](https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit2/stage/19/puzzle/1/)</li></ul> |

| **Practice performance task - Security and Hacking in the Real World** Cyber threats are all around us as criminals exploit the Internet to commit cyber crimes. In this lesson, students will create a visual artifact to inform others about a cybersecurity topic of their choice. They will then examine it with a critical eye to demonstrate a deep understanding of the issue, its functionality, and its impact or potential for impact on people and society.|  [Assessment Lesson Plan](https://code.org/curriculum/cspunit2/20/Teacher) | [Assessment Student Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dRKb0r1C6ppj3j43j52cJCUTo4lneJveWnqsbmmT5sM/edit) |
