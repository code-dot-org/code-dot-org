            <h2>Overview</h2>
            
                <p>Students discuss the components of their favorite video games and discover that they can be reduced to a series of coordinates. They then explore coordinates in Cartesian space, identifying the coordinates for the characters in a game at various points in time. Once they are comfortable with coordinates, they brainstorm their own games and create sample coordinate lists for different points in time in their own game.</p>
            

            
                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                
                    <p>This lesson introduces students to the idea that computer programs in general, and video games in particular, are built on a grounding of basic mathematical concepts. By exploring the interactions of different characters in a video game, students will see that the world of a 2 dimensional video game is represented in software by a basic coordinate plane. With that knowledge we can begin to describe (and later program) the movement of game elements with relatively simple mathematical functions. </p>

                    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                    <p>Welcome to Code.org CS in Algebra! In this course you’ll be learning a new programming language - a way to tell computers exactly what you want them to do. Just like English, Spanish or French, a programming language has its own vocabulary and grammar that you’ll have to learn. Fortunately, the language you’ll be using here has a lot in common with the simple math that you already know!</p>
<h3 id="learning-a-language">Learning a Language</h3>
<p>Discuss as a class the nature of language, for example:
- What makes a language?
- Does anyone speak a second (or third) language? Do you speak a different language than your parents/grandparents?
- Are there languages that share features, such as a common root (Romance, Germanic) or a similar alphabet (Latin, Cyrillic, Arabic, Kanji)?
- Are there languages that are designed for specific purposes or within certain constraints (sign language, Esperanto)?
- Math is a language, just like English, Spanish, or any other language!
  - We use nouns, like “bread”, “tomato”, “mustard” and “cheese” to describe physical objects. Math has values, like the numbers 1, 2 or 3, to describe quantities.
  - We also use verbs like “toast”, “slice”, “spread” and “melt” to describe operations on these nouns. Mathematics has functions like addition and subtraction, which are operations performed on numbers.
  - Just as you can “slice piece of bread”, a person can also “add four and five”.</p>
<p>A mathematical expression is like a sentence: it’s an instruction for doing something. The expression 4+5 tells us to add 4 and 5. To evaluate an expression, we follow the instructions in the expression. The expression 4+5 evaluates to 9.</p>

                    <h2>Video Game Analysis</h2>
                    <h3 id="reverse-engineering-a-demo">Reverse Engineering a Demo</h3>
<p>Let’s begin by exploring a simple video game, and then figuring out how it works. Open <a href="http://studio.code.org/s/algebra/lessons/1/levels/2/" target="_blank">this link</a> to play the game, and spend a minute or two exploring it. You can use the arrow keys to move the up and down - try to catch the unicorn and avoid the dragon!</p>
<p>This game is made up of characters, each of which has its own behavior. The unicorn moves from the left to the right, while the dragon moves in the opposite direction. The ninja only moves when you hit the arrow keys, and can move up and down. We can figure out how the game works by first understanding how each character works.</p>
<p><strong>Directions:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1) Divide students into groups of 2-4.</p>
<p>2) Provide each student with a copy of the reverse-engineering table.</p>
<p>3) As students demo the game, ask them to fill in the “Thing in the game…” column with every object they see in the game.</p>
<p>4)  Discuss with the whole group which things they came up with. Characters? Background? Score?</p>
<p>5)  Next, for each of the things in the game, fill in the column describing what changes. Size? Movement? Value?</p>
<p>6)  Ask students to share back with the whole group. Note how students described changes - how detailed were they? What words did they use to describe movement?</p>
</blockquote>
                
            </div>
        
            <div class="activity">
                
                    <h2>Coordinate Planes</h2>
                    <p><img alt="number line" src="https://code.org/curriculum/docs/algebra/number_line.png" style="width: 200px; float: right; padding: 0 0 10px 10px;">
Computers use numbers to represent a character’s position on screen, using number lines as rulers to measure the distance from the bottom-left corner of the screen. For our video game, we will place the number line so that the screen runs from 0 (on the left) to 400 (on the right). We can take the image of the Dragon, stick it anywhere on the line, and measure the distance back to the left hand edge. Anyone else who knows about our number line will be able to duplicate the exact position of the Dragon, knowing only the number. What is the coordinate of the Dragon on the right hand side of the screen? The center? What coordinate would place the Dragon beyond the left hand edge of the screen?</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Teaching Tip</p>
<p>The key point for students here is precision and objectivity. There are many possible correct answers, but students should understand why any solution should be accurate and unambiguous. This requires students to propose solutions that share a common “zero” (the starting point of their number line) and direction (literally, the direction from which a character’s position is measured).</p>
</div>
<p><img alt="coordinate plane" src="https://code.org/curriculum/docs/algebra/coordinate_plane.png" style="width: 200px; float: left;">
By adding a second number line, we can locate a character anywhere on the screen in either dimension. The first line is called the x-axis, which runs from left to right. The second line, which runs up and down, is called the y-axis. A 2-dimensional coordinate consists of both the x- and y-locations on the axes. Suppose we wanted to locate the Ninja’s position on the screen. We can find the x-coordinate by dropping a line down from the Ninja and read the position on the number line. The y-coordinate is found by running a line to the y-axis.</p>
<p>A coordinate represents a single point, and an image is (by definition) many points. Some students will ask whether a character’s coordinate refers to the center of the image, or one of the corners. In this particular program, the center serves as the coordinate - but other programs may use another location. The important point in discussion with students is that there is flexibility here, as long as the convention is used consistently.</p>
<p>When we write down these coordinates, we always put the x before the y (just like in the alphabet!). Most of the time, you’ll see coordinates written like this: (200, 50) meaning that the x-coordinate is 200 and the y-coordinate is 50.</p>
<p>Depending on how a character moves, their position might change only along the x-axis, only along the y-axis, or both. Look back to the table you made. Can the Ninja move up and down in the game? Can he move left and right? So what’s changing: his x-coordinate, his y-coordinate, or both? What about the clouds? Do they move up and down? Left and right? Both?</p>
<p>OPTIONAL ACTIVITY:  Depending on timing and the background of your students, having one student place a character on a large graph and another student stating the coordinates is excellent practice.  Students often need extra practice remembering which coordinate comes first.  Coordinates do not have to be exact but they should be in the correct order.  Extending this to all four quadrants to include negative numbers is also excellent practice.</p>
<p>Fill in the rest of the reverse-engineering table, identifying what is changing for each of your characters.</p>

<p>The structure of your students’ games will very closely resemble the demo they’ve just played. Many students will want to reach for the stars and design the next Halo. Remind them that major games like that take massive teams many years to build. Some of the most fun and enduring games are built on very simple mechanics (think Pacman, Tetris, or even Flappy Bird).</p>
</div>
<p>Use the <a class="resource" href="https://code.org/curriculum/docs/algebra/worksheets/game_planning.pdf" target="_blank">Video Game Design Template</a> to make your own game. Just like we made a list of everything in the Ninja game, we’re going to start with a list of everything in your game.
To start, your game will have four things in it:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Background, such as a forest, a city, space, etc.</li>
<li>A Player, who can move when the user hits a key.</li>
<li>A Target, which flies from the right to the left, and gives the player points for hitting it.</li>
<li>A Danger, which flies from the right to the left, which the player must avoid.</li>

                    <summary><strong>MP</strong> - Math Practices</summary>
                    <ul>
                        
                            <li><strong>MP.1</strong> - Mathematically proficient students start by explaining to themselves the meaning of a problem and looking for entry points to its solution. They analyze givens, constraints, relationships, and goals. They make conjectures about the form and meaning of the solution and plan a solution pathway rather than simply jumping into a solution attempt. They consider analogous problems, and try special cases and simpler forms of the original problem in order to gain insight into its solution. They monitor and evaluate their progress and change course if necessary. Older students might, depending on the context of the problem, transform algebraic expressions or change the viewing window on their graphing calculator to get the information they need. Mathematically proficient students can explain correspondences between equations, verbal descriptions, tables, and graphs or draw diagrams of important features and relationships, graph data, and search for regularity or trends. Younger students might rely on using concrete objects or pictures to help conceptualize and solve a problem. Mathematically proficient students check their answers to problems using a different method, and they continually ask themselves, &quot;Does this make sense?&quot; They can understand the approaches of others to solving complex problems and identify correspondences between different approaches.</li>
                        
                            <li><strong>MP.2</strong> - Mathematically proficient students make sense of quantities and their relationships in problem situations. They bring two complementary abilities to bear on problems involving quantitative relationships: the ability to decontextualize—to abstract a given situation and represent it symbolically and manipulate the representing symbols as if they have a life of their own, without necessarily attending to their referents—and the ability to contextualize, to pause as needed during the manipulation process in order to probe into the referents for the symbols involved. Quantitative reasoning entails habits of creating a coherent representation of the problem at hand; considering the units involved; attending to the meaning of quantities, not just how to compute them; and knowing and flexibly using different properties of operations and objects.</li>
                        
                            <li><strong>MP.3</strong> - Mathematically proficient students understand and use stated assumptions, definitions, and previously established results in constructing arguments. They make conjectures and build a logical progression of statements to explore the truth of their conjectures. They are able to analyze situations by breaking them into cases, and can recognize and use counterexamples. They justify their conclusions, communicate them to others, and respond to the arguments of others. They reason inductively about data, making plausible arguments that take into account the context from which the data arose. Mathematically proficient students are also able to compare the effectiveness of two plausible arguments, distinguish correct logic or reasoning from that which is flawed, and—if there is a flaw in an argument—explain what it is. Elementary students can construct arguments using concrete referents such as objects, drawings, diagrams, and actions. Such arguments can make sense and be correct, even though they are not generalized or made formal until later grades. Later, students learn to determine domains to which an argument applies. Students at all grades can listen or read the arguments of others, decide whether they make sense, and ask useful questions to clarify or improve the arguments.</li>
                        
                            <li><strong>MP.4</strong> - Mathematically proficient students can apply the mathematics they know to solve problems arising in everyday life, society, and the workplace. In early grades, this might be as simple as writing an addition equation to describe a situation. In middle grades, a student might apply proportional reasoning to plan a school event or analyze a problem in the community. By high school, a student might use geometry to solve a design problem or use a function to describe how one quantity of interest depends on another. Mathematically proficient students who can apply what they know are comfortable making assumptions and approximations to simplify a complicated situation, realizing that these may need revision later. They are able to identify important quantities in a practical situation and map their relationships using such tools as diagrams, two-way tables, graphs, flowcharts and formulas. They can analyze those relationships mathematically to draw conclusions. They routinely interpret their mathematical results in the context of the situation and reflect on whether the results make sense, possibly improving the model if it has not served its purpose.</li>
                        
                            <li><strong>MP.5</strong> - Mathematically proficient students consider the available tools when solving a mathematical problem. These tools might include pencil and paper, concrete models, a ruler, a protractor, a calculator, a spreadsheet, a computer algebra system, a statistical package, or dynamic geometry software. Proficient students are sufficiently familiar with tools appropriate for their grade or course to make sound decisions about when each of these tools might be helpful, recognizing both the insight to be gained and their limitations. For example, mathematically proficient high school students analyze graphs of functions and solutions generated using a graphing calculator. They detect possible errors by strategically using estimation and other mathematical knowledge. When making mathematical models, they know that technology can enable them to visualize the results of varying assumptions, explore consequences, and compare predictions with data. Mathematically proficient students at various grade levels are able to identify relevant external mathematical resources, such as digital content located on a website, and use them to pose or solve problems. They are able to use technological tools to explore and deepen their understanding of concepts.</li>
                        
                            <li><strong>MP.6</strong> - Mathematically proficient students try to communicate precisely to others. They try to use clear definitions in discussion with others and in their own reasoning. They state the meaning of the symbols they choose, including using the equal sign consistently and appropriately. They are careful about specifying units of measure, and labeling axes to clarify the correspondence with quantities in a problem. They calculate accurately and efficiently, express numerical answers with a degree of precision appropriate for the problem context. In the elementary grades, students give carefully formulated explanations to each other. By the time they reach high school they have learned to examine claims and make explicit use of definitions.</li>
                        
                            <li><strong>MP.7</strong> - Mathematically proficient students look closely to discern a pattern or structure. Young students, for example, might notice that three and seven more is the same amount as seven and three more, or they may sort a collection of shapes according to how many sides the shapes have. Later, students will see 7 × 8 equals the well remembered 7 × 5 + 7 × 3, in preparation for learning about the distributive property. In the expression x2 + 9x + 14, older students can see the 14 as 2 × 7 and the 9 as 2 + 7. They recognize the significance of an existing line in a geometric figure and can use the strategy of drawing an auxiliary line for solving problems. They also can step back for an overview and shift perspective. They can see complicated things, such as some algebraic expressions, as single objects or as being composed of several objects. For example, they can see 5 - 3(x - y)2 as 5 minus a positive number times a square and use that to realize that its value cannot be more than 5 for any real numbers x and y.</li>
                        
                            <li><strong>MP.8</strong> - Mathematically proficient students notice if calculations are repeated, and look both for general methods and for shortcuts. Upper elementary students might notice when dividing 25 by 11 that they are repeating the same calculations over and over again, and conclude they have a repeating decimal. By paying attention to the calculation of slope as they repeatedly check whether points are on the line through (1, 2) with slope 3, middle school students might abstract the equation (y - 2)/(x - 1) = 3. Noticing the regularity in the way terms cancel when expanding (x - 1)(x + 1), (x - 1)(x2 + x + 1), and (x - 1)(x3 + x2 + x + 1) might lead them to the general formula for the sum of a geometric series. As they work to solve a problem, mathematically proficient students maintain oversight of the process, while attending to the details. They continually evaluate the reasonableness of their intermediate results.</li>

                            <li><strong>6.NS.5</strong> - Understand that positive and negative numbers are used together to describe quantities having opposite directions or values (e.g., temperature above/below zero, elevation above/below sea level, credits/debits, positive/negative electric charge); use positive and negative numbers to represent quantities in real-world contexts, explaining the meaning of 0 in each situation.</li>

                            <li><strong>5.OA.2</strong> - Write simple expressions that record calculations with numbers, and interpret numerical expressions without evaluating them.
