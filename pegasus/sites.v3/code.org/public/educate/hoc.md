# Teach the Hour of Code in your classroom

Hour of Code is an opportunity for every student to try computer science for one hour.

You can also teach the Hour of Code all year-round. Tutorials will work on browsers, tablets, smartphones, or "unplugged."

## Tips for teaching the Hour of Code:

### Prep for the Hour of Code:

**Choose a tutorial for your students**

- Check out the [tutorials](/learn) and pick one for your class. Tutorials will be available in as many as 20 languages.
- Go through the tutorial yourself so you can help students during the Hour of Code.
- Test tutorials on student computers or devices. Make sure they work properly (with sound and video).
- Preview the congrats page to see what students will see when they finish. 
- If the tutorial you choose works best with sound, provide headphones for your class, or ask students to bring their own.

**Plan ahead based on your technology available**

- **Don't have enough devices?** Use [pair programming](http://www.ncwit.org/resources/pair-programming-box-power-collaborative-learning). When students partner up, they help each other and rely less on the teacher. They’ll also see that computer science is social and collaborative.
- **Have low bandwidth?** Plan to show videos at the front of the class, so each student isn't downloading their own videos. Or try the unplugged / offline tutorials.

### During the Hour of Code
**Inspire your students - show them a video**

Show students an inspirational video to kick off the Hour of Code. Examples:

- The original Code.org launch video, featuring Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and NBA star Chris Bosh (There are [1 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYZF6oIZtfc), [5 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc), and [9 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1xS07N-FA) versions)
- The [Hour of Code 2013 launch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC5FbmsH4fw), or the <% if @country == 'uk' %> [Hour of Code 2014 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96B5-JGA9EQ) <% else %> [Hour of Code 2014 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7AjDMz_dc&index=2&list=PLzdnOPI1iJNe1WmdkMG-Ca8cLQpdEAL7Q) <% end %>
- [President Obama calling on all students to learn computer science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvmhE1J9PY)
 
**Get your students excited - give them a short intro**

Most kids don’t know what computer science is. Here are some ideas:

- Explain it in a simple way that includes examples of applications that both boys and girls will care about (saving lives, helping people, connecting people, etc.).
- Try: "Think about things in your everyday life that use computer science: a cell phone, a microwave, a computer, a traffic light… all of these things needed a computer scientist to help build them.”
- Or: “Computer science is the art of blending human ideas and digital tools to increase our power. Computer scientists work in so many different areas: writing apps for phones, curing diseases, creating animated movies, working on social media, building robots that explore other planets and so much more."
- See tips for getting girls interested in computer science [here](/girls). 

### Start your Hour of Code

**Direct students to the activity**

- Write the tutorial link on a whiteboard. Find the link listed on the [information for your selected tutorial](http://code.org/learn) under the number of participants. (Example: [hourofcode.com/co](http://code.org/learn)) 
- Tell students to visit the URL and start the tutorial.

**When your students come across difficulties**

- Tell students, “Ask 3 then me.” Ask 3 classmates, and if they don’t have the answer, then ask the teacher.
- Encourage students and offer positive reinforcement: “You’re doing great, so keep trying.”
- It’s okay to respond: “I don’t know. Let’s figure this out together.” If you can’t figure out a problem, use it as a good learning lesson for the class: “Technology doesn’t always work out the way we want. Together, we’re a community of learners.” And: “Learning to program is like learning a new language; you won’t be fluent right away.“
- Check the [Hour of Code forum](http://forums.code.org/?forum=322773) to ask questions and see FAQs. 


**What to do if a student finishes early?**

- Students can see all tutorials and try another Hour of Code activity at [code.org/learn](http://code.org/learn).
- Or, ask students who finish early to help classmates who are having trouble with the activity.


**How do I print certificates for my students?**

Each student gets a chance to get a certificate via email when they finish the [Code.org tutorials](http://studio.code.org). You can click on the certificate to print it. However, if you want to make new certificates for your students, visit our [Certificates](/certificates) page to print as many certificates as you like, in one fell swoop! :-)

**What comes after the Hour of Code?**

The Hour of Code is just the first step on a journey to learn more about how technology works and how to create software applications. To continue this journey, find additional resources for educators [here](/educate). Or encourage your children to learn [online](/learn/beyond) or in a [local camp or workshop](/learn/local)
