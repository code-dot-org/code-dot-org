# Teach the Hour of Code in your classroom

Tens of millions of students of all ages and backgrounds have tried an Hour of Code, a one-hour introduction designed to demystify computer science and show that anybody can learn the basics.

While students worldwide join together to learn an Hour of Code during [our international campaign each December](http://hourofcode.com/), you can bring it to your students anytime.
