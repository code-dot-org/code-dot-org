# What is CS Discoveries?

<div class="col-50" style="padding-right: 20px">

<p>Computer Science Discoveries is an introductory computer science course for 6 - 10th grade students. Mapped to CTSA standards, the course takes a wide lens on computer science by covering topics such as problem solving, programming, physical computing, user centered design, and data, while inspiring students as they build their own websites, apps, animations, games, and physical computing systems. </p>

<p>CS Discoveries can be flexibly taught as a single semester, two semesters over multiple years, or as a full-year course. Options are even available for less than one semester. Our curriculum is available at <a href="/commitment", target=_"blank">no cost</a> for anyone, anywhere to teach. And, <a href="/educate/professional-learning/middle-high">professional learning opportunities</a> are available!</p>

# Why should you teach CS Discoveries?

## Engaging Curriculum

Our team designed the CS Discoveries curriculum to support students and teachers new to the discipline. The curriculum includes daily lesson plans made up of inquiry-based activities, videos, assessments, and computing tools, allowing teachers to guide and learn alongside students as they discover core computing concepts throughout the following units:

[col-33]

<center><img src="/images/csd-prob-process.png" style="width:300px"></center>

<div style="margin-left: 15px; margin-top: 10px;">The <strong>Problem Solving unit</strong> is a highly interactive and collaborative introduction to the field of computer science. Through a series of puzzles, challenges, and real world scenarios, students are introduced to a problem solving process and learn how computers input, output, store, and process information. </div>

[/col-33]

[col-33]

[<center><img src="/images/WebLab.png" style="width:300px">](/weblab)</center>

<div style="margin-left: 15px; margin-top: 10px;">Students are empowered to create and share their own content using the <a href="/weblab">Web Lab</a> platform in the <strong>Web Development unit</strong>. They engage in problem solving as it relates to programming, as they learn valuable skills such as debugging, commenting, and structure of language.</div>

[/col-33]

[col-33]

[<center><img src="/images/animated-examples/tennis_jump.gif" style="width:300px">](/gamelab)</center>

<div style="margin-left: 15px; margin-top: 10px;">In the <strong>Interactive Animations and Games unit</strong>, students create programmatic images, animations, interactive art, and games in <a href="/gamelab">Game Lab</a>. Along the way, they practice design, testing, and iteration, as they come to see that failure and debugging are an expected and valuable part of the programming process.</div>

[/col-33]

<p style="clear:both"></p>
<br>

[col-33]

<center><img src="/images/csd-design.png" style="width:300px"></center>

<div style="margin-left: 15px; margin-top: 10px;">Students transition from thinking about computer science as a tool to solve their own problems towards considering the broader social impacts of computing in the <strong>Design Process unit</strong>. Through a series of design challenges, students prototype technological solutions to a problem both on paper and in <a href="/applab">App Lab</a>, before testing their solutions with real users.</div>

[/col-33]

[col-33]

<center><img src="/images/csd-data.png" style="width:300px"></center>

<div style="margin-left: 15px; margin-top: 10px;">The <strong>Data and Society unit</strong> highlights how computers can help us use data to solve problems. First, students explore different systems used to represent information in a computer, then they learn how collections of data are used to solve problems, and how computers help automate the steps of this process.</div>

[/col-33]

[col-33]

[<center><img src="/images/animated-examples/circuitplayground.gif" style="width:300px">](/applab)</center>

<div style="margin-left: 15px; margin-top: 10px;">In the <strong>Physical Computing unit</strong>, students use <a href="/applab">App Lab</a> and Adafruit’s Circuit Playground to develop programs that utilize the same hardware inputs and outputs that we see in many modern smart devices, and they get to see how a rough prototype can lead to a finished product. The unit concludes with a design challenge that asks students to use the Circuit Playground as the basis for an innovation of their own design.

## A Focus on Emerging Technologies

The CS Discoveries curriculum features a unit on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), which can also be taught as a standalone module. As these technologies touch more and more of our daily lives, they have become an essential part of foundational computer science education. The unit focuses on AI ethics, examines issues of bias, and explores and explains fundamental concepts through a number of online and unplugged activities and full-group discussions. Teachers can view the module <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/csd7-2021" target="_blank">here</a>.

	<summary style="font-size: 18px"><a name="pathway"></a><b>How does CS Discoveries fit with the other Code.org courses?</b></summary>
	<p>
	<br/>

CS Discoveries is designed to fit naturally between our [CS Fundamentals](/educate/curriculum/elementary-school) courses and our [CS Principles](/educate/csp) course. While each of these courses is designed to be an age-appropriate entry point to computer science, students with previous experience will find many new topics to explore, and they will revisit familiar topics in novel and more challenging contexts.

For more information about our goals and approach to our courses, please see our [curriculum values](/educate/curriculum/values) and our [professional learning values](/educate/professional-learning/values).
