# Professional Learning #
<img src="/images/k5pdcropped.jpg" width="100%"/>


Code.org has worked with partners and experts in the field to develop and support a blended Professional Learning model that embraces the importance of in-person, cooperative workshops and uses online and asynchronous components to provide an ongoing community and support when teachers are in the classroom. This PL experience builds on the work of others and recognizes that one size does not fit all, therefore the PL is tailored for each course and curriculum developed or selected by Code.org. All of our PL experiences use engaging techniques to prompt teachers to reflect on the pedagogy of teaching computer science while also becoming more familiar with the subject. All PL includes hands-on experiences, collaboration with colleagues, and is accessible to teachers with any or no prior knowledge of computer science.

## Nationwide workshops for elementary school educators, free of charge
Code.org is offering 1-day workshops to prepare educators and content-area teachers (librarians, tech-ed specialists, etc.) to introduce computer science basics in a format that's fun and accessible to the youngest learners (grades K-5). The workshops will cover content for our elementary school curriculum, and teachers will receive the supplies they need to teach the courses - at no cost. Not only is this an opportunity to increase your knowledge and confidence in facilitating an engaged computer science classroom, it's also a chance to connect with other educators in your area who are working to bring computer science to their schools.

These workshops will be facilitated by experienced computer science educators in over 60 cities across the United States.
