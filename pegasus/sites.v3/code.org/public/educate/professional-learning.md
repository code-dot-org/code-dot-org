### Nationwide workshops for elementary school educators, free of charge

Code.org offers 1-day workshops to prepare educators and content-area teachers (librarians, tech-ed specialists, etc.) to introduce computer science basics in a format that's fun and accessible to the youngest learners (grades K-5). The workshops will cover content for [our elementary school curriculum](/educate/curriculum/elementary-school), and you will receive the supplies you need to teach the courses - at no cost. You don't need any previous experience teaching computer science to join us. Not only is this an opportunity to increase your knowledge and confidence in facilitating an engaged computer science classroom, it's also a chance to connect with other educators in your area who are working to bring computer science to their schools.

These workshops are facilitated by experienced computer science educators across the United States.

### Professional learning for middle and high school teachers to teach computer science

Our middle and high school programs offer year-round support. The program kicks off with a 5-day summer workshop where you'll have an opportunity to work hands-on with the curriculum and meet other teachers from your area. Throughout the year, we offer online support for upcoming units, forum support, and 1-day quarterly workshops. You don't need any prior computer science experience to get started.

<h4>7-9th grade: Computer Science Discoveries</h4>

For educators in 7-9th grade classrooms, our Computer Science Discoveries course is a great place to start. The course can be taught as a semester or full-year introduction and covers a broad range of topics such as physical computing, building websites, programming and learning about data.

<h4>9-12th grade: Computer Science Principles</h4>

If you're teaching 9-12th grade students, our Computer Science Principles course can be taught as an AP or non-AP course. Either way, there are no prerequisites required. The course is designed to be far more than a traditional introduction to programming - it is a rigorous, engaging, and approachable course. It explores many of the big, foundational ideas of computing so all students understand how these concepts are transforming the world we live in.

## International

Teachers anywhere in the world can use our free, self-paced [online workshop](https://studio.code.org/s/K5-onlinePD) to get started. The intended audience for this online workshop is primary school teachers.

At this point, our in-person  workshops are only available in the United States, but the [curriculum, lesson plans, tools, and support](https://studio.code.org/courses) are available at no cost worldwide. And, [join our forums](https://forum.code.org/) to connect with other teachers for support, teaching tips, and best practices. Our forums are for teachers of all grade levels.

You can also contact our [international partners](https://hourofcode.com/international-partners) for more information on local professional learning opportunities.

## Professional Learning Philosophy

Code.org has worked with partners and experts in the field to develop and support a blended Professional Learning model that embraces the importance of in-person, cooperative workshops and uses online and asynchronous components to provide an ongoing community and support when teachers are in the classroom.

This experience builds on the work of others and recognizes that one size does not fit all. The Professional Learning is tailored for each course and curriculum developed or selected by Code.org. All of our experiences use engaging techniques to prompt teachers to reflect on the pedagogy of teaching computer science while also becoming more familiar with the subject. All include hands-on experiences, collaboration with colleagues, and are accessible to teachers with any or no prior knowledge of computer science.

For the intellectually curious, we've also published our [professional learning philosophy](/educate/professional-development-philosophy) and [curriculum values](/educate/curriculum/values) which we use to guide our own team's effort as well as our work with our education partners.
