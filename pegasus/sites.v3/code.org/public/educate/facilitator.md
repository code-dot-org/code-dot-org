## How do you apply?
At the time of application to the program, participants choose a curriculum focus area:

- [Computer Science Fundamentals Facilitator Development](/educate/k5-affiliates)
- [Computer Science Principles Facilitator Development](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_SA7QWZYNHWdDeCWCV4nlj4artpG-Ck50UqMpQrQqqc/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Exploring Computer Science Facilitator Development](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_SA7QWZYNHWdDeCWCV4nlj4artpG-Ck50UqMpQrQqqc/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Computer Science in Algebra Facilitator Development](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_SA7QWZYNHWdDeCWCV4nlj4artpG-Ck50UqMpQrQqqc/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Computer Science in Science Facilitator Development](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_SA7QWZYNHWdDeCWCV4nlj4artpG-Ck50UqMpQrQqqc/edit?usp=sharing)

All focus areas share a basic framework and approach, drawn from adult learning theory and best practices for facilitation, that ensures participants are well prepared to lead high-quality training. However, each focus area’s training curriculum is designed for the specific needs of the teachers and students impacted by the program, and for that reason has its own unique selection criteria, requirements, commitments and benefits. 

Please carefully review [the criteria, requirements and commitments](google doc here) for the curriculum focus area of your choice. When you’re ready, click below to apply.
