# Teach Computer Science at Your School

## Why computer science?

Computer science opens more doors for students than any other discipline in today’s world. Learning even the basics will help students lead in virtually any career  from architecture to zoology.

## Professional development — at no cost to schools
Participating teachers consistently call our professional development, "The best professional development I've ever had!" Training for next school year begins in May.
