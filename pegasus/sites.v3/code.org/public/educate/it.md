# IT requirements for Code.org tutorials

## Hardware

- We recommend at least a 15 MBit/sec Internet connection for your school.
- You will need a desktop or laptop computer with a mouse (or touchpad) and keyboard for our middle and high school-level courses, CS Discoveries and CS Principles.
    - iPads (including with a keyboard attachment) or other tablets are not supported for CS Discoveries or CS Principles.
    - All other content, such as K-5 courses (Computer Science Fundamentals) and Hour of Code activities are compatible on iPads and Chromebooks, in addition to all other modern laptop or desktop computers.

## Supported Browsers and Platforms

Code.org takes a tiered approach to the level of support we provide for different browsers and platforms to ensure we are building a stellar experience for most of our users, and an acceptable experience for the rest. We support the following combinations of operating systems and browsers:

| **Browser** | **Operating System** |
|---------------|---------------|
| Chrome 33.x and higher | XP & Windows 7 and higher <br><br> Mac OS 10.6 and higher <br><br> Android 4.1.2 and higher <br><br> ChromeOS (Chromebooks)|
| Safari 7.0.x and higher | Mac OS 10.6 and higher <br><br> iOS 7.x and higher|
| Internet Explorer 11 and higher | Windows 7 and higher <br><br> Mac OS 10.6 and higher|
| Microsoft Edge | Windows 10 and higher |
| Firefox 25.x and higher | Windows 7 and higher |
**Note that all CS Principles and CS Discoveries courses are not compatible with tablets or mobile devices - a full keyboard and mouse (or touchpad, like on Macbooks) are required. Chromebooks are compatible. iPads or other tablets with a keyboard attachment are not compatible.**

## Sites to Unblock

For the very best experience with all Code.org content, we recommend consulting with your school or district's IT department to ensure the following sites are allowed and aren't blocked.


| Priority | URL                                                                                                                                                    |

| **Optional**    | `https://cdn.optimizely.com`<br/>`https://www.google-analytics.com`                                                                                    |

| **To use YouTube hosted videos** <br/>(Deprecated late July 2018)| `https://s.youtube.com/*`<br/>`https://www.youtube.com/*`<br/>`https://*.googlevideo.com/*`<br/>`https://*.ytimg.com/*`                                |
| **To use Code.org hosted videos**                                                  | **Unblock:**<br/>`https://videos.code.org`<br/>**Block:**<br/>`https://www.youtube.com/favicon.ico`<br/>`https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/favicon.ico` |

| **To use Web Lab** | `https://downloads.computinginthecore.org`<br/>`https://codeprojects.org`                                                                              |

## Videos

We use [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) to embed videos into Code.org and our [online learning platform](https://studio.code.org). For schools with YouTube blocked, we attempt to display a Code.org hosted video player instead.

### Can you play this video?

Before you start Code.org's online courses, test playback for the video below to make sure you're good to go.

<iframe style="margin: 10px;" width="350" height="195" src="https://studio.code.org/videos/embed/artist_intro?width=350&height=195" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This is the player used throughout the curriculum. It will try to show the video through YouTube and, if YouTube is blocked, show the Code.org hosted video instead.

### Video not playing?

If the default (auto-detected) player above is not playing videos properly, here are two other options to make it work:

#### Use the fallback video player

If YouTube is blocked at your school, we will default to the Code.org hosted fallback video player. If this does not work, submit your information at the [video test page](https://studio.code.org/videos/test) so we can help diagnose the issue.

#### Continue without streaming videos

If you can't get embedded videos to play, you can still use our tutorials without them.

1. We've made all our videos [available for download together](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/aax85b3850olxcx/mso9d17QtH). If your school has low bandwidth, we recommend that you download videos and show them to students on a shared screen.
2. Integrated into our tutorials, we've added a green download link icon <img src="/images/green-download.png" width=25 height=25/> for each video, allowing students to download individual tutorial videos.
3. If all fails, there is a "Show Notes" tab that provides a storyboard equivalent of videos.

## Special settings for Google Apps/G-Suite users

If you're a G-suite administrator, be sure to check what your restriction settings are for YouTube.  If you have specified the "Strict Restricted YouTube Access" setting or if you see messages stating 'this video has been restricted', you can add our channel to the approved list of channels.  See [this guide](https://support.google.com/a/answer/6245597) from Google to learn about how to add our channel to the approved list.  You can also see [this guide](https://support.google.com/a/answer/6212415?hl=en) to learn more about different settings and which is best for your classroom.
