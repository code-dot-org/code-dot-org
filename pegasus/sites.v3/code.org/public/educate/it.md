## Supported Browsers and Platforms

Code.org takes a tiered approach to the level of support we provide for different browsers and platforms to ensure we are building a stellar experience for most of our users, and an acceptable experience for the rest. We support the following combinations of operating systems and browsers:

| **Browser**                   | **Operating System**                                                                                               |

## Sites to Unblock

For the very best experience with all Code.org content, we recommend consulting with your school or district's IT department to ensure the following sites are allowed and aren't blocked.

| Priority                                                                                 | URL                                                                                                                                                    |

## Mobile and Tablet Support Details

All CS Discoveries, CS Principles, and Intro to App Lab courses are not compatible with tablets or mobile devices - a full keyboard and mouse (or touchpad, like on MacBooks) are required. Most tablets are not supported, with the following exceptions:

- Microsoft Surface Pro with an external keyboard
- iPad running iPadOS 13.4 or later with an external keyboard and an external mouse or touchpad

All other content, such as K-5 courses (Computer Science Fundamentals) and Hour of Code activities are compatible on iPads and Chromebooks in addition to all other modern tablets and laptop or desktop computers.

### Mobile Phones

Our Hour of Code activities and CS Fundamentals courses can be completed on mobile phones. While these activities are usable, they are not optimized for a mobile phone experience and have some known limitations (e.g. touch targets may be small, accessory elements may display offscreen, and text may be difficult to input using the on-screen keyboard). The CS Discoveries, CS Principles, and Intro to App Lab courses are not usable on mobile phones.

## Videos

We use [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) to embed videos into Code.org and our [online learning platform](https://studio.code.org). For schools with YouTube blocked, we attempt to display a Code.org hosted video player instead.

### Can you play this video?

Before you start Code.org's online courses, test playback for the video below to make sure you're good to go.

<iframe style="margin: 10px;" width="350" height="195" src="https://studio.code.org/videos/embed/artist_intro?width=350&height=195" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This is the player used throughout the curriculum. It will try to show the video through YouTube and, if YouTube is blocked, show the Code.org hosted video using our "fallback" player instead.

### Video not playing?

If video does not work, you can email us at support@code.org.

However, you can still use our tutorials without video.

1. We've made all our videos [available for download together](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/aax85b3850olxcx/mso9d17QtH). If your school has low bandwidth, we recommend that you download videos and show them to students on a shared screen.
2. Integrated into our tutorials, we've added a green download link icon <img src="/images/green-download.png" width=25 height=25/> for each video, allowing students to download individual tutorial videos.
3. If all fails, there is a "Show Notes" tab that provides a storyboard equivalent of videos.

## Special settings for Google Apps/G-Suite users

If you're a G-suite administrator, be sure to check what your restriction settings are for YouTube. If you have specified the "Strict Restricted YouTube Access" setting or if you see messages stating 'this video has been restricted', you can add our channel to the approved list of channels. See [this guide](https://support.google.com/a/answer/6245597) from Google to learn about how to add our channel to the approved list. You can also see [this guide](https://support.google.com/a/answer/6212415?hl=en) to learn more about different settings and which is best for your classroom.
