# Bring Computer Science To California Schools

## The Opportunity in California

- 68,352 currently open computing jobs 
- 3,525 computer science graduates from California universities last year
- *Only 16% of schools in the state offer AP Computer Science*
- *Fewer than 2,000 black or Hispanic students took AP Computer Science last year*

## Do You Offer Your Students This Foundational Knowledge?

Computer science opens more doors for students than any other discipline in today’s world. Learning even the basics will help students lead in virtually any career -- from architecture to zoology.  Just as we teach students multiplication and division, or how electricity works, it’s important for every 21st century student to have a chance to “dissect an app,” or learn how the Internet works.

## Teachers can sign up for professional learning to offer computer science. It's free of charge!
Please help us spread the word to California principals and teachers, at all grade bands, but especially in high schools. Or reach out to Vinh Luong, Code.org's Southwest Regional Manager, [vinh@code.org](mailto:vinh@code.org) to talk about how to bring comprehensive computer science to your district.

<br />

The College Board has proposed a new AP® course called AP® Computer Science Principles.*  The course is designed to be far more than a traditional introduction to programming - it is a rigorous, engaging, and approachable course that explores many of the big, foundational ideas of computing so that all students understand how these concepts are transforming the world we live in. The official AP® exam is set to go live in the 2016-17 school year with an exam and portfolio-based assessment.

<br />
Code.org's curriculum consists of daily lesson plans, videos, tutorials, tools, and assessments that cover learning objectives from the [CS Principles Curriculum Framework](http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/comp-sci-principles-draft-cf-final.pdf). Course materials teach this class in the context of learning about the the Internet and programming in the JavaScript language.

<img src="/images/csdiscoveries-montage.jpg" width="500px">

Computer Science Discoveries is a full-year introductory computer science survey course (can be implemented as two standalone semesters) targeted at upper middle school and lower high school. The course takes a wide lens on computer science by covering topics such as programming, physical computing, HTML/CSS, and data. Students are empowered to create authentic artifacts and engage with CS as a medium for creativity, communication, problem solving, and fun. This course will be piloted in Spring 2017, and will be rolling out Summer 2017.
