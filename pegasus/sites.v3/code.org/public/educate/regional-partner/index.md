# Regional Partner Program

## About the Program

Code.org is selecting United States based organizations, as partners, to help spread computer science in a local, sustainable fashion. The goal of the Regional Partner program is to help each organization establish itself as a K-12 computer science hub for their region, offering professional learning opportunities for teachers and building a strong local community. In the long run, the expectation is that each partner organization can sustain this work independently of Code.org.

To begin the partnership, each partner's Program Manager will attend TeacherCon in Phoenix, Arizona July
21-27, 2018 to experience Code.org teacher professional devleopment first-hand.  In September, the partner will attend our Regional Partner Summit, a fabulous experience designed to welcome Regional Partners to the extended Code.org family. In addition, we will provide funding based on demonstrated need to help each organization establish itself as a local Code.org Regional Partner.

The ideal Regional Partner is a U.S. based regional education unit, a nonprofit, or a university with existing, positive relationships with nearby school districts and the local education community.
