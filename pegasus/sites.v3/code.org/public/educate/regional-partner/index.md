# Regional Partner Program

## About the Program

Code.org is selecting United States based organizations, as partners, to help spread computer science in a local, sustainable fashion. The goal of the Regional Partner program is to help each organization establish itself as the K-12 computer science hub for their region, offering professional learning opportunities for teachers and building a strong local community. In the long run, the expectation is that each partner organization can sustain this work independently of Code.org.

To begin the partnership, each partner's Program Manager will attend our Regional Partner Summit, a fabulous experience designed to welcome Regional Partners to the extended Code.org family. In addition, we will provide funding based on demonstrated need to help each organization establish itself as a local Code.org Regional Partner.

The ideal Regional Partner is a U.S. based regional education unit, a non-profit, or a university with existing, positive relationships with nearby school districts and the local education community.

**We will open applications for new Regional Partners in Spring 2018. Check the map below to see if your region needs a partner. If it does, please submit an Interest Form. We will notify you when applications are open.
