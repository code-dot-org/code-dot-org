# Facilitators


#### Facilitators are key to building a sustainable computer science community in your region. They are the bridge between your organization and the teachers you serve and impact the quality of the professional learning programs. The following resources will help you sustain and grow a strong corps of local facilitators.

### New Facilitators Attend Local Summer Workshops
Due to an increase in new facilitators this year, new facilitators for Group 1 and 2 partners will be attending the local summer workshops instead of TeacherCon. A few key points:

- All new facilitators (regardless of group) will still attend one of the two Code.org-hosted Facilitator-in-Training (FiT) weekends this summer, where they'll learn how to co-lead academic year workshops. This means everyone will still have the chance to meet Code.org staff in person, and get a feel for Code.org events.
- We think it's important for new facilitators to meet and learn alongside the teachers who will be in their cohort**. The summer is an excellent time for them to start building those strong relationships locally.
- New facilitators won’t count towards filling your teacher cohort. 
- Code.org will cover all cost of travel for these facilitators.
- Code.org will cover stipends, if applicable: 
	- Novice facilitators do not receive payment from code.org for attending the 5-day workshop, because they're attending as teachers. 
	- Apprentice facilitators will receive a $1000 stipend for attending (paid by code.org). 
Partners are responsible for paying their lead facilitators for the week.

**If your summer workshop is scheduled after the last Facilitator in Training (FiT) Weekend (July 28 - 29, 2018), we will find an alternate summer workshop date and location that falls before that training. This way, your facilitators will still experience the five-day workshop before joining the FiT weekend. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact your Regional Manager.

### Booking Facilitators for Local Summer Workshops
For those who need to book extra facilitators beyond your current capacity for local summer workshops.

If you:

- Don’t have enough trained facilitators locally to run your local summer workshop, and 
- Have talked with your Regional Manager about approval for booking facilitators (if not, please do so as soon as possible). 

Then:

- Check [this list](http://bit.ly/facilitator-summer-availability) for trained facilitators’ summer workshop availability. 
- Reach out directly to schedule them for your workshops as needed.  
- Start by emailing 1-2 facilitators close to you. Then, if they are not available, expand your search and reach out to 1-2 more. **Do not** email all available facilitators at once, as they will be overwhelmed by many partner requests. 
- Update [the list](http://bit.ly/facilitator-summer-availability) in the “Booked/Confirmed by” column when you’ve booked someone. 
- Update your workshop dashboard with the name of your booked facilitator. 

Remember, the sooner you start this the easier it will be to find an available facilitator.

**Important**: Book facilitators only for workshops that have been confirmed with Code.org/Regional Manager. Do not book facilitators for additional cohorts that you may be adding later based on teacher recruitment numbers. 

Since you will likely be making quick decisions, we suggest including language like this in your email to facilitators:<br/>

- "I've reached out to a few facilitators who indicated they were available this week in the summer availability survey. I know there's a lot of interest in helping this week, so I'll need to move forward with the first two people who are able to respond and commit to this week."

## Example Facilitator One Pager
The facilitator one pager should be sent to facilitators at least 10 days prior to the workshop. It provides facilitators all of the logistical information needed to run their workshop.

Use <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FobsNOHi91ioe5ZoCeiWNgDslQkTPF4w31j2ii8q4Bk/edit" target=_blank>this one pager</a> as an example of how to format the information that facilitators will need to run a successful workshop.

## Example contract
[This is an example](/files/example-facilitation-agreement.pdf) of an agreement that facilitators sign when facilitating for Code.org. You should develop your own agreement for use with facilitators that meets your organization's particular needs, and which ensures that the terms of the Regional Partner agreement you have signed with Code.org, particularly Section 3 (Indemnification), Section 6.1 (Description of Duties) and Section 7 (Confidential Information), are met.

*DISCLAIMER: By providing this example, Code.org is not offering you legal advice. You should consult a lawyer if you need advice about contracts, the language therein, or any other legal matter.*

## Facilitator Payments

**CS Principles & CS Discoveries Facilitator Payments**

- All facilitators are paid $500 per workshop day for workshops they co-lead
- Each Regional Partner is responsible for contracting with and paying any facilitators who run local workshops. *(Note: this includes any out of region facilitators)*
- Code.org will directly pay facilitators for co-leading workshops at TeacherCon.
- Code.org will directly pay facilitators for completing the reflections and reviews for each Deeper Learning unit
- For Local Summer Workshops:
	- Novice Facilitators attend as teachers, and are not paid for attending the workshop. Novices are new facilitators who did not participate in a previous Code.org Professional Learning Program for this course.
	- Code.org will pay Apprentice Facilitators directly for attending and supporting the workshop. Apprentices are new facilitators who have participated in a previous Code.org Professional Learning Program for this course. They will observe workshops, and engage in daily preparation and debrief sessions with lead facilitators.
	- All Lead Facilitators are paid by Regional Partners at the expected rate of $500/day.
- For Facilitator-in-Training Weekends: Code.org will pay all new facilitators for attending the training. 


<br/>

**CS Fundamentals Facilitator Payments**

- CS Fundamentals facilitators are paid $400 for workshop facilitation.****
  - Note: CS Discoveries and CS Principles are paid $500 per workshop day, which is different from CS Fundamentals. Each CS Discoveries and CS Principles academic year workshop contains different content, so this payment includes the additional preparation required to deliver these workshops.
- Each Regional Partner is responsible for contracting with and paying any facilitators who run local workshops. (Note: this includes any out of region facilitators).
- Code.org will directly pay facilitators for Facilitator Development activities and events.
- If facilitators help with recruiting or other aspects of running the workshop, you should consider increasing their per workshop rate. Please reference Exhibit B in your CS Fundamentals MOU to see how the workshop payments received can support an increased rate.   
- Some facilitators will have a different payment structure because they work for a district.
Facilitators can host workshops that are not associated with their Regional Partner, but these will no longer be paid for by Code.org. Two common cases for this will be:
  - Working with another Regional Partner to help meet demand in their region
  - Facilitating a workshop for in-service elementary school teachers in districts that have funding to compensate the facilitator directly. In this case Code.org will strongly encourage actively coordinating and collaborating with the Regional Partner that covers that district.
  - Code.org will continue to pay for and provide swag and curriculum guides in both of these cases.

****This Code.org's general recommendation, and on a case-by-case basis, payment may differ.

**Timeline for the CS Fundamentals Funding Model Transition**


- February 2018 - Code.org is requesting facilitators to not schedule any more Code.org paid workshops or put them in the dashboard.
- As soon as March 9, 2018 - Regional Partners and facilitators can start workshops under this agreement and new funding model, in consultation together.
- No later than June 1, 2018 - host your first workshop in collaboration with your CS Fundamentals facilitator(s), *unless otherwise arranged with your Regional Manager.*
	- In some regions, there may be existing Code.org paid workshops that facilitators have already listed in the dashboard. We have clarified with facilitators that these can still be paid under existing facilitator agreements until September 1, 2018.
  - However, our expectation is that facilitators will work in close coordination with the Regional Partner to possibly transition these existing workshops to the new model where Regional Partners pay facilitators directly.
