# Facilitators


#### Facilitators are key to building a sustainable computer science community in your region. They are the bridge between your organization and the teachers you serve and impact the quality of the professional learning programs. The following resources will help you sustain and grow a strong corps of local facilitators.

### Interviewing Facilitators

Keep these three important things on your radar as you prepare for upcoming facilitator interviews. Watch this [very quick recording](https://code.zoom.us/recording/play/_kbC3EU3s8sHFBPeessecWvewQcZLofgK0dFZXzOFL2BU8SYM-gorH_WBj6vuXQ-?startTime=1548267193000) for more details, and read below for the highlights.

1.  **Interview Scheduling:**
All Group 1 - 3 Regional Partners are responsible for scheduling interviews with their candidates during the interview period of Feb. 11 - March 1. Interviews should be booked for 30 minutes, and should include a video chat (e.g., Google hangout, Zoom, etc.) if theyâ€™re not hosted in-person. However, we recommend you block an hour on your calendar for prepare and review. Remember that many candidates are teachers who have limited availability during the school day, so please be prepared to host interviews in the late-afternoon or early evening.
2.  **Interview Support:** All Group 1 - 3 Regional Partners are responsible for hosting interviews on their own, without the support of a Code.org-contracted co-interviewer. This means that Regional Partners will need to plan ahead to make sure they are able to conduct the interview while taking notes in the application dashboard.
3.  **Interview Questions and Process:** We will cover the interview process and required interview questions in detail during the February Regional Partner Summit.

### Example Facilitator One-Pager for 6-12 Programs
The facilitator one-pager should be sent to facilitators at least 10 days prior to the academic year workshops. It provides facilitators with the logistical information needed to run their workshop.

Use <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FobsNOHi91ioe5ZoCeiWNgDslQkTPF4w31j2ii8q4Bk/edit" target=_blank>this one-pager</a> as an example of how to format the information that facilitators will need to run a successful workshop.

### Example contract
[This is an example](/files/example-facilitation-agreement.pdf) of an agreement that facilitators sign when facilitating for Code.org. You should develop your own agreement for use with facilitators that meets your organization's particular needs, and which ensures that the terms of the Regional Partner agreement you have signed with Code.org, particularly Section 3 (Indemnification), Section 6.1 (Description of Duties) and Section 7 (Confidential Information), are met.

We have created these example Scope of Work documents that you can use as a planning resource when establishing a relationship with a K-5 or 6-12 facilitators. These document lives in our shared Google Drive folder.
