### Example Facilitator One-Pager for 6-12 Programs
The facilitator one-pager should be sent to facilitators at least 10 days prior to the academic year workshops. It provides facilitators with the logistical information needed to run their workshop.

Use <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FobsNOHi91ioe5ZoCeiWNgDslQkTPF4w31j2ii8q4Bk/edit" target=_blank>this one-pager</a> as an example of how to format the information that facilitators will need to run a successful workshop.

### Example contract
[This is an example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12xtLUisQB0VJHQAxtNBVUcFYJzT9uXXuMKPrJ5ChLsw/view) of an agreement that facilitators sign when facilitating for Code.org. You should develop your own agreement for use with facilitators that meets your organization's particular needs, and which ensures that the terms of the Regional Partner agreement you have signed with Code.org, particularly Section 3 (Indemnification), Section 6.1 (Description of Duties) and Section 7 (Confidential Information), are met.

We have created these example Scope of Work documents that you can use as a planning resource when establishing a relationship with a K-5 or 6-12 facilitators. These document lives in our shared Google Drive folder.
