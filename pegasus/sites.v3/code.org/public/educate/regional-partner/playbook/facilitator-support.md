#### Facilitators are key to building a sustainable computer science community in your region. They are the bridge between your organization and the teachers you serve and impact the quality of the professional learning programs.

## Securing Substitute Facilitators
Facilitators who are interested in traveling to support workshops in other regions can add their names and contact information to the [Code.org Facilitator Contact and Availability](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ccefl3MO-Z0ETyq9MmpvqiK9KTPOXoubVVckp28VXrU/edit#gid=0) (currently being updated by facilitators for summer 2022). Regional Partners should reach out to available facilitators directly when in need of a substitute.

## Example Contract
[This is an example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12xtLUisQB0VJHQAxtNBVUcFYJzT9uXXuMKPrJ5ChLsw/view) of an agreement that facilitators sign when facilitating for Code.org. You should develop your own agreement for use with facilitators that meets your organization's particular needs, and which ensures that the terms of the Regional Partner agreement you have signed with Code.org, particularly Section 3 (Indemnification), Section 6.1 (Description of Duties) and Section 7 (Confidential Information), are met.

We have created these example Scope of Work documents that you can use as a planning resource when establishing a relationship with a K-5 or 6-12 facilitators. These document lives in our shared Google Drive folder.
