# Facilitators


#### Facilitators are key to building a sustainable computer science community in your region. They are the bridge between your organization and the teachers you serve and impact the quality of the professional learning programs. The following resources will help you sustain and grow a strong corps of local facilitators.

## Booking Facilitators for Local Summer Workshops
For those who need to book extra facilitators beyond your current capacity for local summer workshops.

If you:

- Don’t have enough trained facilitators locally to run your local summer workshop, and 
- Have talked with your Regional Manager about approval for booking facilitators (if not, please do so as soon as possible). 

Then:

- Check [this list](http://bit.ly/facilitator-summer-availability) for trained facilitators’ summer workshop availability. 
- Reach out directly to schedule them for your workshops as needed.  
- Start by emailing 1-2 facilitators close to you. Then, if they are not available, expand your search and reach out to 1-2 more. **Do not** email all available facilitators at once, as they will be overwhelmed by many partner requests. 
- Update [the list](http://bit.ly/facilitator-summer-availability) in the “Booked/Confirmed by” column when you’ve booked someone. 
- Update your workshop dashboard with the name of your booked facilitator. 

Remember, the sooner you start this the easier it will be to find an available facilitator!

**Important**: Book facilitators only for workshops that have been confirmed with Code.org/Regional Manager. Do not book facilitators for additional cohorts that you may be adding later based on teacher recruitment numbers.

## Example Facilitator One Pager
The facilitator one pager should be sent to facilitators at least 10 days prior to the workshop. It provides facilitators all of the logistical information needed to run their workshop.

Use <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FobsNOHi91ioe5ZoCeiWNgDslQkTPF4w31j2ii8q4Bk/edit" target=_blank>this one pager</a> as an example of how to format the information that facilitators will need to run a successful workshop.

## Example contract
[This is an example](/files/example-facilitation-agreement.pdf) of an agreement that facilitators sign when facilitating for Code.org. You should develop your own agreement for use with facilitators that meets your organization's particular needs, and which ensures that the terms of the Regional Partner agreement you have signed with Code.org, particularly Section 3 (Indemnification), Section 6.1 (Description of Duties) and Section 7 (Confidential Information), are met.

*DISCLAIMER: By providing this example, Code.org is not offering you legal advice. You should consult a lawyer if you need advice about contracts, the language therein, or any other legal matter.*
