## **Examples for Online Support**

[Code.org Forums](http://forum.code.org/)<br/>
These forums are program specific and are a great way for teachers to help each other with questions about their online coursework and workshops. We recommend giving your teachers a space to help each other answer questions, and collaborate.<br/>

[Code.org FAQ](/educate/pd/15-16/faq)<br/>
This FAQ from previous workshops should NOT be used to answer your teacher's questions, but can provide you with a great example of how to set up your own FAQ for your teachers' specific needs. 

[CS Principles Teacher Dashboard Walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebQY8fb2OV4&feature=youtu.be)
This video helps CS Principles teachers create sections and move students between sections as needed.

## **Technology in Classroom**

As part of the application and selection process, it's important to ensure that schools, districts, and teachers selected to participate in our programs can meet Code.org’s technology requirements before they are selected to participate in the program. 

Whitelisting is the act of placing a domain or email on an ‘acceptable list’ for an organization's (school district or company) firewall. Some school districts will block all websites and emails that are not specifically entered into their whitelist. Generally, to whitelist a domain or email you will need to reach out to the organization’s IT department.    

The following guidelines will need to be met for teachers to be able to participate fully in their Professional Learning Program.   

Please review each of these sites for the general guidlines for whitelisting:

[Teacher Participation Guidelines](/educate/it) <br/>
[Classroom Requirements for Teaching](/educate/pd/supports) <br/>

The following email addresses should also be whitelisted:

teacher@code.org<br/>
hadi_partovi@code.org<br/>

Should a district contact you with issues regarding technology, please email us at partner@code.org.
