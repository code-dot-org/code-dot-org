# Workshops & Professional Learning Program

Workshops are the core of Code.org's Teacher [Professional Learning Program](https://code.org/educate/professional-learning-2018).  Each Regional Partner will work with the districts and schools in its region to select a date for each workshop. Code.org provides schedule recommendations based on when teachers will most likely need workshops based on where students will be in the curriculum.

## **6-12: Computer Science Discoveries & Computer Science Principles**

<details>
  <summary>**Teacher Packets and Agendas**</summary>
  <p>
  <br/>
Please look at the agendas for each academic year workshop - shared with facilitators at the following links.  Pay particular attention to the "Supplies" portion of the agenda that the facilitator will need from regional partners to run a successful workshop. 

- **[CS Discoveries](https://curriculum.code.org/plcsd/)**: See Workshop Agendas section halfway down the page
- **[CS Principles](https://curriculum.code.org/plcsp/)**: See Workshop Agendas section halfway down the page

  <summary>**Securing a Venue**</summary>
  <p>
These guidelines explain the type of space your facilitators need to run a successful workshop and provide important tips to consider for logistics and teacher experience.  <br/>

| |Requirements and Suggestions|
|:-----|:-----------|
|**Location**|**Ask yourself these questions when searching for the ideal location for your workshop.**<br/> - Central location: Is the location central to the spread of teachers attending? <br/>- Catering: Are there several options to order from within 20 miles? Is there an internal or preferred caterer for the venue?<br/> - Parking: Does parking cost anything? Will teachers need parking passes? Is the lot close to an entrance? *Tip: teachers are more likely to show up to the workshop when parking is free.* <br/> - Access: Will there be someone from the venue there to open the building, help with getting supplies to your room(s), and be available to help with technology as needed during the workshop?|
|**Rooms and <br/>Set Up**|Reservation time: <br/> Every workshop requires 6 hours of content. Add breakfast/registration, lunch and any additional things you want to do with teachers as time on top of that.<br/> <br/> Rooms Needed:<br/>- One room for entire group<br/>- Breakout room to set up catering and for eating. Hallway space also works. We want to avoid interrupting the session by setting up food in the room.<br/>- Wall space for hanging poster sized paper with Blue painter's tape<br/><br/>Seating<br/>- Pods of 4 people for the size of the group. We recommend 8 pods.|  
|**Technology <br/>Requirements**| - Projector and screen<br/> - Power outlets and extension cords<br/> - Wifi that can support access by all participants (4 MB/s minimum, 8 MB/s is ideal.)<br/> |
|**Logistical and Facilitator One Pager Information**|- Physical Address of Workshop<br/>- Address to ship supplies (If needed)<br/> - Map of the Campus and/or building to help teachers find the room. Driving instructions should be provded to teachers. This can be done via Google Maps or Bing Maps.<br/> - Wifi strength, name and password. All participants will need to be on the network at the same time with no lag.<br/> - Arrangments for Access: You should make arrangements with your venue contact to give you access to the building and help you locate supplies.|

  <summary>**Ordering Supplies and Catering**</summary>
  <p>
  <br/>
**Ordering Supplies**<br/>
Supplies for your Local Summer Workshop should be ordered through Mimeo at least 3 weeks prior to your workshop.

For the academic year workshops, you will place one order 3 weeks prior to your first workshop. This shipment will include a full year's worth of supplies to cover all the workshops during the academic year.

**Catering** <br/>
For multi-day events like summer workshops, provide a heartier breakfast to get teachers through the day, ideally breakfast sandwiches or a hot buffet, with juice and coffee service. In addition, the lunch option should vary from day to day.<br/>

Always accommodate vegetarian needs, roughly ⅓ of the order. In communications to teachers and workshop attendees ask that if they have special dietary restrictions that they plan accordingly. It’s very difficult to plan for every need, and is often more expensive.<br/><br/>

<details>
	<summary>**Note:** Sending Welcome Kits for Local Summer Workshops (Only G1/G2)</summary>
		<p>
Code.org has prepared a digital **Welcome Kit** for each teacher accepted into a Code.org 6-12 Professional Learning Program. Since teachers are receiving all communications directly from you, their Regional Partner, we’d like for you to send them their Welcome Kits after they register for your local summer workshop. 

The Welcome Kits are an opportunity for teachers to learn more about the course and Professional Learning Program, as well as tips and tools to help spread the word about their course to students, fellow educators, and school administrators. 

**Who sends the Welcome Kits?**

All partners who are hosting their own local summer workshops are responsible for sending Welcome Kits to teachers accepted into their cohort. 


**When should I send the Welcome Kits?**

You should send out the welcome kit to a teacher only after they have accepted their spot in the program and registered for their local summer workshop. You do not need to send them out with your accept messages! You can send them out one at a time as teachers register, or you can send them out in batches. Sending them out sooner, rather than later, after the teacher confirms their seat, is recommended. This allows the teachers to have maximum time to utilize the resources provided. 


**Where can I find the Welcome Kits?**

The Welcome Kits are located in our shared Google Drive, in the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DFzRglfRbCghxABHWzv1fstwCwIJwy3d" target=_blank>2018 Welcome Kits folder</a>. Be sure to make a copy of the kit for your own use before sending!

- <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sRs25CdbJa0FrbJH61LfYYBhaJyAIV93" target=_blank>2018 CS Principles Teacher Welcome Kit</a>


**What do I need to do before sending the Welcome Kits?**

1. Read through the CS Discoveries Teacher Welcome Letter and the CS Principles Teacher Welcome Letters. This will give you an overview of what is included in the Welcome Kit. 

2. Make a copy of the 2018 CS Discoveries Teacher Welcome Kit and the 2018 CS Principles Teacher Welcome Kit for your own use. 

3. Customize the CS Discoveries and CS Principles Teacher and Administrator Welcome Letters with your organization's name and information. Save them as PDFs. 

4. You can also choose to add additional resources for teachers. If so, you should list these added resources in the Teacher Welcome Letters. 

5. Decide how you are going to send them. For example, you could combine all the resources into a single PDF. (Be sure to include any resources that you might have chosen to add in this combined PDF). We recommend combining the resources into a single PDF for ease of sending. 

6. Send the welcome kit to your teachers!

<details>
	<summary>**Note**: 2017-2018 Quarter 3 & 4 Options for AP/non-AP Teachers CS Principles Teachers</summary>
		<p>
Content about the Advancement Placement (AP) exam is the focus of the second half of the Quarter 3 and Quarter 4 CS Principles workshop. Many of you have cohorts that are mixed, ie. AP teachers and non-AP teachers. It can be challenging for facilitators to address the needs of both groups of teachers at the same time.

Based on your particular cohort and workshop training environment, here are a few options for you to consider if you have a mixed cohort. We suggest checking with your facilitators before making changes.

- Option 1: “Do Nothing” - this means that some of the afternoon content will be less relevant and engaging for some teachers.
-  Option 2: “Two Rooms” - if you have the option logistically, you can split the workshop into two rooms for the afternoon, with one facilitator in each room. If you choose this option your facilitators need to be willing to spend extra time preparing for a sessions outside the normal workshop agenda. Please check that they are willing to make that extra time commitment before choosing this option.
-  Option 3: “Go Home After Lunch” - if the majority of your cohort is AP, you could give the non-AP group the option to go home after lunch. This won’t affect your workshop attendance minimums for payment. If you use this option, we would recommend talking to your facilitators to see if they would be willing to host dedicated office hours for the non-AP group.
