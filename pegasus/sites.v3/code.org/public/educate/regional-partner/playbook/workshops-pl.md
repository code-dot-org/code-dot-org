# Workshops & Professional Learning Program

Workshops are the core of Code.org's Teacher [Professional Learning Program](https://code.org/educate/professional-learning-2018).  Each Regional Partner will work with the districts and schools in its region to select a date for each workshop. Code.org provides schedule recommendations based on when teachers will most likely need workshops based on where students will be in the curriculum.

  <summary>**Securing a Venue**</summary>
  <p>
These guidelines explain the type of space your facilitators need to run a successful workshop and provide important tips to consider for logistics and teacher experience.  <br/>

| |Requirements and Suggestions|
|:-----|:-----------|
|**Location**|**Ask yourself these questions when searching for the ideal location for your workshop.**<br/> - Central location: Is the location central to the spread of teachers attending? <br/>- Catering: Are there several options to order from within 20 miles? Is there an internal or preferred caterer for the venue?<br/> - Parking: Does parking cost anything? Will teachers need parking passes? Is the lot close to an entrance? *Tip: teachers are more likely to show up to the workshop when parking is free.* <br/> - Access: Will there be someone from the venue there to open the building, help with getting supplies to your room(s), and be available to help with technology as needed during the workshop?|
|**Rooms and <br/>Set Up**|Reservation time: <br/> Every workshop requires 6 hours of content. Add breakfast/registration, lunch and any additional things you want to do with teachers as time on top of that.<br/> <br/> Rooms Needed:<br/>- One room for entire group<br/>- Breakout room to set up catering and for eating. Hallway space also works. We want to avoid interrupting the session by setting up food in the room.<br/>- Wall space for hanging poster sized paper with Blue painter's tape<br/><br/>Seating<br/>- Pods of 4 people for the size of the group. We recommend 8 pods.|  
|**Technology <br/>Requirements**| - Projector and screen<br/> - Power outlets and extension cords<br/> - Wifi that can support access by all participants (4 MB/s minimum, 8 MB/s is ideal.)<br/> |
|**Logistical and Facilitator One Pager Information**|- Physical Address of Workshop<br/>- Address to ship supplies (If needed)<br/> - Map of the Campus and/or building to help teachers find the room. Driving instructions should be provded to teachers. This can be done via Google Maps or Bing Maps.<br/> - Wifi strength, name and password. All participants will need to be on the network at the same time with no lag.<br/> - Arrangments for Access: You should make arrangements with your venue contact to give you access to the building and help you locate supplies.|

  <summary>**Ordering Supplies and Catering**</summary>
  <p>
  <br/>
**Ordering Supplies**<br/>
The only supplies available through Mimeo for the 2018-19 academic year is swag for Administrator & Counselor PD.

Regional Partners were issued lump sump supplies payments for the 2018-19 academic year based on the number of Code.org-funded cohorts per program.

More information about ordering supplies for your 2019 Local Summer Workshop is coming soon!

Vist the [Ordering Supplies](https://code.org/educate/regional-partner/playbook/ordering-supplies) tile for more information. 

**Catering** <br/>
For multi-day events like summer workshops, provide a heartier breakfast to get teachers through the day, ideally breakfast sandwiches or a hot buffet, with juice and coffee service. In addition, the lunch option should vary from day to day.<br/>

Always accommodate vegetarian needs, roughly ⅓ of the order. In communications to teachers and workshop attendees ask that if they have special dietary restrictions that they plan accordingly. It’s very difficult to plan for every need, and is often more expensive.<br/><br/>
