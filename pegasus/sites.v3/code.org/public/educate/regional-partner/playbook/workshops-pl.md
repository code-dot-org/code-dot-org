# Workshops & Professional Learning Program

Workshops are the core of Code.org's Teacher [Professional Learning Program](https://code.org/educate/professional-learning).  Each Regional Partner will work with the districts and schools in its region to select a date for each workshop. Code.org provides schedule recommendations based on when teachers will most likely need workshops based on where students will be in the curriculum.
