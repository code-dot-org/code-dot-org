### **If we are selected as the Code.org Regional Partner in our region, can we publish a press release?**

Of course! Anyone accepted to be a partner can publish a press release. We ask that your organization take the lead on the content and that Code.org is provided the opportunity to review it prior to print.

### **Does my organization need to provide facilitators for CS Principles and CS Discoveries?**

Your organization does not need to have its own facilitators. Code.org Regional Partners contracts with facilitators and alumni from Code.org's [facilitator development program](https://code.org/facilitator).
