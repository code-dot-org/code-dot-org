These guidelines explain the type of space your facilitators need to run a successful workshop and provide important tips to consider for logistics and teacher experience.  <br/>

| |Requirements and Suggestions| 
|:-----|:-----------|
|**Location**|**Ask yourself these questions when searching for the the ideal location for your workshop.**<br/> - Central location: Is the location central to the spread of teachers attending? <br/>- Catering: Are there several options to order from within 20 miles? Is there an internal or preferred caterer for the venue?<br/> - Parking: Does parking cost anything? Will teachers need parking passes? Is the lot close to an entrance? *Tip: teachers are more likely to show up to the workshop when parking is free.* <br/> - Access: Will there be someone from the venue there to open the building, help with getting supplies to your room(s), and be available to help with technology as needed during the workshop?| 
|**Rooms and <br/>Set Up**|Reservation time: <br/>8:00am to 4:30pm.<Br/> General itinerary:<br/> 8:00 am - 8:30 am - facilitators arrive and set up room<br/>8:30 am - 9:00 am - teachers arrive, register & eat breakfast</br> 9:00 am - 12:00 pm - workshop time<br/> 12:00 pm - 1:00 pm - break for lunch<br/>1:00 pm - 3:30 pm - workshop time<br/>3:30 pm - 4:30 pm - facilitators clean up for the night <br/><br/>Rooms Needed:<br/>- One room for entire group<br/>- Breakout room to set up catering and for eating. Hallway space also works. We want to avoid interrupting the session by setting up food in the room.<br/>- Wall space for hanging poster sized paper with Blue painter's tape<br/><br/>Seating<br/>- Pods of 4 people for the size of the group. We recommend 8 pods.|  
|**Technology <br/>Requirements**| - Projector and screen<br/> - Power outlets and extension cords<br/> - Wifi that can support access by all participants (4 MB/s minimum, 8 MB/s is ideal.)<br/> |
|**Logistical and Facilitator One Pager Information**|- Physical Address of Workshop<br/>- Address to ship supplies (If needed)<br/> - Map of the Campus and/or building to help teachers find the room. Driving instructions should be provded to teachers. This can be done via Google Maps or Bing Maps.<br/> - Wifi strength, name and password. All participants will need to be on the network at the same time with no lag.<br/> - Arrangments for Access: You should make arrangements with your venue contact to give you access to the building and help you locate supplies.|

  <summary>**Ordering Supplies and Catering**</summary>
  <p> 
**Ordering Supplies**<br/>
Please order your supplies for quarterly workshops through Mimeo. Supplies should be ordered at least 3 weeks prior to your workshop. They will be available online in August.


**Catering** <br/>
For multi-day events like summer workshops, provide a heartier breakfast to get teachers through the day, ideally breakfast sandwiches or a hot buffet, with juice and coffee service. In addition, the lunch option should vary from day to day.<br/>

Always accommodate vegetarian needs, roughly ⅓ of the order. In communications to teachers and workshop attendees ask that if they have special dietary restrictions that they plan accordingly. It’s very difficult to plan for every need, and is often more expensive.<br/><br/>

**Ordering Supplies**<br/>
Supplies for your Local Summer Workshop should be ordered through Mimeo at least 3 weeks prior to your workshop. 

For the academic year workshops, you will place one order 3 weeks prior to your first workshop. This shipment will include a full year's worth of supplies to cover all the workshops during the academic year.

**Catering** <br/>
For multi-day events like summer workshops, provide a heartier breakfast to get teachers through the day, ideally breakfast sandwiches or a hot buffet, with juice and coffee service. In addition, the lunch option should vary from day to day.<br/>

Always accommodate vegetarian needs, roughly ⅓ of the order. In communications to teachers and workshop attendees ask that if they have special dietary restrictions that they plan accordingly. It’s very difficult to plan for every need, and is often more expensive.<br/><br/>

1. Setup your ECS workshops in the [Code.org Organizer Dashboard](/educate/professional-learning-partner/playbook/workshop-dashboard). **This should be done as soon as you know the workshop dates - please let us know if you are having any difficulties.*<br/>
2. Make sure ALL facilitators (veteran + facilitators in training) are added to the workshop. **If you forget to add them, they will not get paid!*<br/>
3. If you haven’t already, reach out to your facilitators and introduce yourself and tell them a bit about your organization. <br/>
4. *For Summer Workshops*: if you are CodeVA, DePaul, Nextech or Utah send all teachers [an email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jXQ275B8tVhYieI2yFCIUqIiJ-dnK4ZPuO7YC2SMkhg/edit#heading=h.qz8c6xpaktl) asking them to register for your workshop using the dashboard registration link. Code.org will send this email on behalf of everyone else.<br/>
	*For Academic Year Workshops*: all organizations should send [an email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jXQ275B8tVhYieI2yFCIUqIiJ-dnK4ZPuO7YC2SMkhg/edit#heading=h.qz8c6xpaktl) asking teachers to register for your workshop using the dashboard registration link.
6. Four weeks prior - order catering<br/>

  <summary>**Securing a Venue**</summary>
  <p>
These guidelines explain the type of space your facilitators need to run a successful workshop and provide important tips to consider for logistics and teacher experience.  <br/>

| |Requirements and Suggestions| 
|:-----|:-----------|
|**Location**|**Ask yourself these questions when searching for the the ideal location for your workshop.**<br/> - Central location: Is the location central to the spread of teachers attending? <br/>- Catering: Are there several options to order from within 20 miles? Is there an internal or preferred caterer for the venue?<br/> - Parking: Does parking cost anything? Will teachers need parking passes? Is the lot close to an entrance? *Tip: teachers are more likely to show up to the workshop when parking is free.* <br/> - Access: Will there be someone from the venue there to open the building, help with getting supplies to your room(s), and be available to help with technology as needed during the workshop?| 
|**Rooms and <br/>Set Up**|Reservation time: <br/>Rooms need to be reserved from 7:30 am to 4:30 pm (M-Th) and 7:30 am to 2:30 pm (F).<Br/><br/> General itinerary:<br/> 7:30 am - 8:30 am - facilitators arrive and set up room<br/>8:30 am - 9:00 am - teachers arrive, register & eat breakfast</br> 9:00 am - 12:00 pm - workshop time<br/> 12:00 pm - 1:00 pm - break for lunch<br/>1:00 pm - 3:30 pm - workshop time<br/>3:30 pm - 4:30 pm - facilitators clean up for the night<br/>Note: ECS workshops end at 1:30 pm on Fridays.<br/><br/>Rooms Needed:<br/>- One room for entire group<br/>- Breakout room to set up catering and for eating. Hallway space also works. We want to avoid interrupting the session by setting up food in the room.<br/>- Wall space for hanging poster sized paper with Blue painter's tape<br/><br/>Seating<br/>- Pods of 4 people for the size of the group. We recommend 8 pods.|

|**Logistical and Facilitator One Pager Information**|- Physical Address of Workshop<br/>- Address to ship supplies (If needed)<br/> - Map of the Campus and/or building to help teachers find the room. Driving instructions should be provded to teachers. This can be done via Google Maps or Bing Maps.<br/> - Wifi strength, name and password. All participants will need to be on the network at the same time with no lag.<br/> - Arrangments for Access: You should make arrangements with your venue contact to give you access to the building and help you locate supplies.<br/>

**When Workshops Should be Held**<br/>

* Workshop 1 = unit 3
	* 6-8 weeks into school
	* You need to balance the content (unit 3) with the ability to check in on how it’s going with building classroom culture.
* Workshop 2 = unit 4
	* Close to the end of first semester
* Workshop 3 = unit 5
	* First few weeks of second semester
* Workshop 4 = unit 6 
	* After spring break
	* This workshop is about robotics - make sure you poll teachers in advance to find out how many will be teaching this unit and if alternate options should be offered.<br/>

  <summary>**Ordering Catering**</summary>
  <p> 

For multi-day events like summer workshops, provide a heartier breakfast to get teachers through the day, ideally breakfast sandwiches or a hot buffet, with juice and coffee service. In addition, the lunch option should vary from day to day.<br/>

Always accommodate vegetarian needs, roughly ⅓ of the order. In communications to teachers and workshop attendees ask that if they have special dietary restrictions that they plan accordingly. It’s very difficult to plan for every need, and is often more expensive.<br/><br/>
