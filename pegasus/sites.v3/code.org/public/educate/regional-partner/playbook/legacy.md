  <summary>**Workshop Preparation Process**</summary>
  <p>

1. Setup your CS in Algebra workshop in the [Code.org Organizer Dashboard](/educate/professional-learning-partner/playbook/workshop-dashboard). **This should be done as soon as you know the workshop dates - please let us know if you are having any difficulties.*<br/>
2. Make sure ALL facilitators (veteran + facilitators in training) are added to the workshop **If you forget to add them, they will not get paid!*<br/>
*(Skip to step 4 if this is not a summer workshop)*
3. Send teachers their [accept email and information on how to setup a Code Studio account and access the Phase 1 online module](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yC9BI2atOzosuFouuG70hRr6AmGfgT4EmjHByYSoamM/edit?usp=sharing).<br/>
4. If you haven’t already, reach out to your facilitators and introduce yourself and tell them a bit about your organization.<br/>
5. Send all teachers an [email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jXQ275B8tVhYieI2yFCIUqIiJ-dnK4ZPuO7YC2SMkhg/edit?usp=sharing) asking them to register for your workshop using the dashboard registration link.<br/>
6. Four weeks prior - order catering
7. Three to Four weeks prior (no later than 21 days) - [order your supplies](/educate/professional-learning-partner/playbook/ordering-supplies) from Mimeo. (Summer Workshops Only)
8. One and a half weeks prior - create a [facilitator 1-pager](/educate/professional-learning-partner/playbook/facilitator-support) and email it to your facilitators
9. Two days prior - make sure all your supplies have arrived
10. Day of the workshop
	 - Login to the workshop organizer dashboard to [“Start Workshop”](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FEkjohxBfOkoSjPC0C3EvXztEf-kcocN8uk16WI2tlo/edit#bookmark=id.wmocqedffowl) and have teachers join it.
	- Decide if you or your facilitators take attendance.
	- Make sure all teachers are registered with a Teacher Account! If they have a Student Account, [follow these steps](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FEkjohxBfOkoSjPC0C3EvXztEf-kcocN8uk16WI2tlo/edit#bookmark=id.chfy8viz3je8) to help them switch it.
	- If, Summer, send an email with your Phase 3 workshop registration links ([see this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jXQ275B8tVhYieI2yFCIUqIiJ-dnK4ZPuO7YC2SMkhg/edit#heading=h.udcag7rgm3fg))

<summary>**Securing a venue**</summary>
  <p>
These guidelines explain the type of space your facilitators need to run a successful workshop and provide important tips to consider for logistics and teacher experience.  <br/>

| |Requirements and Suggestions|
|:-----|:-----------|
|**Location**|**Ask yourself these questions when searching for the the ideal location for your workshop.**<br/> - Central location: Is the location central to the spread of teachers attending? <br/>- Catering: Are there several options to order from within 20 miles? Is there an internal or preferred caterer for the venue?<br/> - Parking: Does parking cost anything? Will teachers need parking passes? Is the lot close to an entrance? *Tip: teachers are more likely to show up to the workshop when parking is free.* <br/> - Access: Will there be someone from the venue there to open the building, help with getting supplies to your room(s), and be available to help with technology as needed during the workshop?|
|**Rooms and <br/>Set Up**| Reservation time: <br/>Rooms need to be reserved from 7:30am to 4:30pm.<Br/><br/> General itinerary:<br/> 7:30 am - 8:00 am - facilitators arrive and set up room<br/>8:00 am - 8:30 am - teachers arrive, register & eat breakfast</br> 8:30 am - 12:00 pm - workshop time<br/> 12:00 pm - 1:00 pm - break for lunch<br/>1:00 pm - 4:00 pm - workshop time<br/>4:00 pm - 4:30 pm - facilitators clean up for the night<br/><br/>Rooms Needed:<br/>- One room for entire group<br/>- Breakout room to set up catering and for eating. Hallway space also works. We recommend doing this to avoid interrupting the session by setting up food in the room.<br/>- Wall space for hanging poster sized paper with blue painter's tape<br/>- Space to store supplies overnight: We recommend asking your venue if supplies and posters can be left in the room and locked up overnight to avoid having to pack everything up each day.<br/><br/>Table set up and Seating:<br/>- Classroom style seating with tables that can seat pairs.|
|**Technology <br/>Requirements**| - Projector and screen<br/> - Power outlets and extension cords<br/> - Wifi that can support access by all participants (4 MB/s minimum, 8 MB/s is ideal.)<br/> |
|**Logistical and Facilitator One Pager Information**|- Physical Address of Workshop<br/>- Address to ship supplies (If needed)<br/> - Map of the Campus and/or building to help teachers find the room. Driving instructions should be provded to teachers. This can be done via Google Maps or Bing Maps.<br/> - Wifi strength, name and password. All participants will need to be on the network at the same time with no lag.<br/> - Arrangments for Access: You should make arrangements with your venue contact to give you access to the building and help you locate supplies.|

  <summary>**Scheduling**</summary>
  <p>
Phase 3 is best held in early October prior to when order of operations and early math take place in the classroom, which are the concepts that CS in Algebra Course A integrate into.
</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**Teacher Packets and Agendas**</summary>
  <p>

- [Teacher Workbook](https://code.org/curriculum/docs/algebra/CSinACourseA.pdf) - Packet to print for each teacher attending the summer workshop.
- [Facilitator Agendas](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13w__s1bC2bjum6_L8vxhlQ5Cd_Ai11Qp2YNzV3CVAvE/edit#gid=850221216) - Agendas to guide the facilitators.
- [Facilitator Slide Deck for Summer Workshop](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Pmry84StvBFTQiN6ydgFQCA7wDd61NUvy2NBWT3wFAY/edit#) - Slide deck facilitators should use for the summer workshop.
</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**Ordering Supplies and Catering**</summary>
  <p>
**Supplies**

- 1 Workbook per teacher
- 1 pack of poster paper
- 2 stickies pads per table
- 1 pack of markers per table
<br/>
**Catering**
For multi-day events like summer workshops, provide a heartier breakfast to get teachers through the day, ideally breakfast sandwiches or a hot buffet, with juice and coffee service. In addition, the lunch option should vary from day to day.<br/>

Always accommodate vegetarian needs, roughly ⅓ of the order. In communications to teachers and workshop attendees ask that if they have special dietary restrictions that they plan accordingly. It’s very difficult to plan for every need, and is often more expensive.<br/><br/>

* Workshop 2 = unit 4
	* Close to the end of first semester
* Workshop 3 = unit 5
	* First few weeks of second semester
* Workshop 4 = unit 6
	* After spring break
	* This workshop is about robotics - make sure you poll teachers in advance to find out how many will be teaching this unit and if alternate options should be offered.<br/>
