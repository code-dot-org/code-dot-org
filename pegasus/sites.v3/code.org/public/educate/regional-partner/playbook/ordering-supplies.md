## K-12 Supplies Plan

Code.org will be covering the cost of all initial supplies needed for all K-12 programs. We will do this by shipping materials directly, providing a lump sum for partners to purchase supplies, or by covering the cost of items ordered through the Mimeo Marketplace. The [2019-20 K-12 Supplies Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NJHr2B469TqUjIOFSGomN5yUyu9Pqg9jTI_aYPFmGlY/edit) outlines the details, including key differences in how supplies will be handled in the K-5 program and the 6-12 program.
