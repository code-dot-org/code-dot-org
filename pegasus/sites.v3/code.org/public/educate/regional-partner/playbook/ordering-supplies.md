## Ordering Welcome Kits
Group 1 partners will be able to order Welcome Kits for local CS Principles teachers from the Mimeo Marketplace on **February 28, 2017**.

### Tips

- Welcome Kits are bundled in groups of 10. 
- Order enough kits for the total number of teachers your region plans to recruit. *Example: my organization plans to have a cohort of 24 CS Principles teachers, so I placed an order for 30 welcome kits.*
- All supply orders take 21 days to arrive from our vendor.

### My Welcome Kits have arrived, now what do I do?
Welcome kits should arrive with all collateral stuffed in an unsealed envelope. Once you receive them:

1. Add your customized welcome letters and professional learning overview to the packet.
2. Label the envelope with the teacher's mailing address.
3. Add postage and return label and send.
