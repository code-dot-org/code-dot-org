## Communications to Teachers from Code.org
Code.org sends emails directly to teachers regarding information about any Code.org products, programs, or resources.

- **Professional Learning Program Updates**
	- These emails include updates about the curriculum and online modules, Code Studio tools and resources, and other items related to the Code.org Professional Learning Program. Code.org sends out Program Updates for CS Fundamentals, CS Discoveries and CS Principles.
	- Code.org will provide partners with advance notice of these updates as possible.
<br/><br/>
- **Teacher Community Updates**
	- As long as teachers have Code.org teacher accounts, they will receive a monthly update email from Code.org. These updates include information about the broader Computer Science community and our organization's work.
	- Previous monthly updates can be found on our website for [CS Discoveries](https://code.org/educate/csd/status_signup) and [CS Principles](https://code.org/educate/csp/CSPStatus_Signup).
	- Additionally, Code.org maintains a [blog](http://teacherblog.code.org/) and a [forum](https://forum.code.org/) for teachers.


Teachers will have the option to unsubscribe from different types of emails. Please make sure you check the [Technology Requirements](/educate/professional-learning-partner/playbook/teacher-support#technology) to be sure teachers are able to receive the emails from Code.org.

## Workshop Communications

There are two types of emails regarding logistical information for locally hosted professional development workshops: manual emails written by the Workshop Organizer to invite participants to register for the workshop, and automated emails sent from the workshop dashboard.

- **Manual emails:** The workshop organizer is responsible for sending the following communications to teachers:
	- Invitations to register for a workshop (local summer workshops (Group 1 and 2 Partners only) and academic year workshops (all Partners). The [Academic Year Workshop Process Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lI8E7IE0MOYktAPsmssb6vRVI5--s_5zK8OkUAcw158/edit?disco=AAAAA_lL-1o&ts=59833f89) and the [Local Summer Workshop Process Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12rsY1FMkiVN90-83yvEsikawtsiQzy5wc1xQER1QoyM/edit) has examples of these emails. *These documents will be updated in the spring for the 2017-18 school year.*
	- Emails about meetups and community events you organize
- **Automated emails:** Participants who sign up for a workshop will receive the following automated emails from Code.org. (*Workshop Details information will vary by program. Examples can be found in the [Workshop Dashboard Process Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FEkjohxBfOkoSjPC0C3EvXztEf-kcocN8uk16WI2tlo/edit).*)
	- Workshop Sign Up Confirmations will be automatically sent to a teacher that signs up for a workshop.
	- Workshop Reminder Emails will be automatically sent to every teacher that is signed up for a workshop 10 and 3 calendar days before it begins. These include details from the workshop dashboard about the location, dates, parking information and what to bring to the workshop.

In addition to workshop communications, partners may also be responsible for various communications in the teacher and facilitator applications process. Up to date information can be found in the [2018 Teacher Application Process Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10fGyKGqX9ybLn8zaSDFcYZWdIsGELFflLsNyi1llbtM/edit) and the [2018 Facilitator Application Process Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11-I1qsTrvODrZgKDNP2frGLrMjmUb-C9ChOt7nbqV2Y/edit#).

## Tips for writing an awesome email
We know you’ll be sending out emails about community meetups, workshops, and other important information to your teachers. Here are some tips from Boomerang about how to make emails more effective.

**Subject line:<br/>**

- Make sure you include a subject line! Aim for 3-4 words and keep it accurate. Tell your recipient what’s in the email. If you’re looking for an answer to a question, include the question in the subject.

**Content:<br/>**

- Focus your email content, and plan out your communications so you don’t spam your recipients.
- Use shorter sentences with simpler words. A 3rd grade reading level works best.
- Write short paragraphs, separated by blank links. Unbroken blocks of text don’t do well with recipients.
- Include 1-3 questions in your email.
- Write enough, but not too much. Try to keep messages between 50-125 words.
- Take a stand! Opinionated messages see higher response rates than objective ones.
- Write with moderate emotion -- not neutral, but not excessive. Use a slightly positive or slightly negative tone. Both outperform a completely neutral tone.
- Don’t use ALL CAPS to call out important messages. It looks like yelling, even if that’s not the intention.
