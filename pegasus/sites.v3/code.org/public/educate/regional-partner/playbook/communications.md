## Workshop Communications

There are two types of emails regarding logistical information for professional development workshops: manual emails written by the workshop organizer to invite participants to register for the workshop, and automated emails sent from the workshop dashboard.

- **Manual emails:** The workshop organizer is responsible for sending the following communications to teachers:
	- Invitations to register for a workshop. The [Academic Year Workshop Process Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sJUI1F7r270k8LYMbLBBZwqQho7xJMc0G-YUrfiRJwM/edit) has examples of these emails. The 2019 Local Summer Workshops Process Doc is coming soon.
	- Emails about meetups and community events you organize.
- **Automated emails:** Participants who sign up for a workshop will receive the following automated emails from Code.org. (*Workshop Details information will vary by program. Examples can be found in the [Workshop Dashboard Process Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FEkjohxBfOkoSjPC0C3EvXztEf-kcocN8uk16WI2tlo/edit).*)
	- Workshop Sign Up Confirmations will be automatically sent to a teacher that signs up for a workshop.
	- Workshop Reminder Emails will be automatically sent to every teacher that is signed up for a workshop 10 and 3 calendar days before it begins. These include details from the workshop dashboard about the location, dates, parking information and what to bring to the workshop.

In addition to workshop communications, partners may also be responsible for various communications in the teacher and facilitator applications process. Up to date information can be found in the [2019-20 Teacher Application Process Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bx-o1kRCKZxM_prrQqxQH7mXp9jXY0vT_eufgNpkKYM/edit?usp=sharing) and the [2019-20 Facilitator Application Process Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c6wXrVZ0u4yjV1eJg2INzqacvZV71hwfIxWIQHCM9_I/edit).
