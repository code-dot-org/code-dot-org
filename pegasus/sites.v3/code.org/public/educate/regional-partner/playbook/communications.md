## Communications to Teachers from Code.org
Code.org sends emails directly to teachers regarding information about any Code.org products, programs, or resources.


**Direct - Email<br/>**

- **Code.org new updates**
	- Teacher who opt-in to our Code.org news updates will receive email updates roughly once a month or 12-14 times a year. These updates include information about the broader Computer Science community and our organization's work. 
<br/><br/>
- **Teacher Community Updates/Newsletters**
	- Teachers who register for an account on the Code.org platform or for the Hour of Code can opt-in to a monthly curriculum-specific newsletter update email. 
	- These emails include updates about the curriculum and online modules, Code Studio tools and resources, and announcements that directly affect our teacher community. 
	- Previous monthly updates can be found on our website for [CS Fundamentals] (https://code.org/educate/curriculum/elementary-sign-up), [CS Discoveries](https://code.org/educate/csd/status_signup) and [CS Principles](https://code.org/educate/csp/CSPStatus_Signup).
<br/><br/>
- **Professional Learning Program Announcements**
	- Code.org sends periodic announcements and communications, encouraging teachers to participate in our professional learning program. 
		- Three dedicated emails are sent to teachers across the US between the time that applications for the Professional Learning Program opens in that state and late spring. 
		- At least one will include state specific information, which we will coordinate with regional partners to include. 
	-When there are materials updates made to the Professional Learning Program itself, teachers will be sent an update email. Code.org will provide partners with advance notice of these updates as possible. 
<br/>

**Indirect - Blog, social media<br/>**

Encourage teachers to follow Code.org's blog and social channels to stay updated between direct communications on Code.org announcements, CS community news, and CS education news and resources. <br/>
