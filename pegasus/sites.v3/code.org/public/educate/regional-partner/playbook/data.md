# Using Data

Data informs district and school recruitment by supporting your case and aligning with districts needs. Data can move the needle for districts to implement CS and can show funders the impact of your program. Check out these resources on how you can add data to your recruitment plan.

## K-12 Computer Science Access Report

This is a report of which schools offer any computer science course in the US (including DOE data and survey data). See the Access Report section of the [2019 State of Computer Science Report](https://advocacy.code.org/2019_state_of_cs.pdf). All the data is made public on our site at <http://code.org/yourschool> and as regional partners, you have access to even [more data via Tableau](https://us-east-1.online.tableau.com/#/site/codeorg/workbooks/124362/views)!

Look in the [School-level filter](https://us-east-1.online.tableau.com/#/site/codeorg/views/Regionalpartnerdatasharing/School-levelFilter?:iid=3) view under “Computer Science Activities”. This includes all DOE data and survey data collected in your state and will show you which schools teacher computer science.

## 2020 Fall Data Clean-up
Teacher data from your 2020-21 CS Principles and CS Discoveries summer workshops are now available in Tableau. Use the steps outlined below to review your teacher roster and follow up with non-implementing teachers to see if they may be, or planning, to implement.

**Timeline**
- Review your teacher rosters and follow-up with non-implementing teachers between now and October 30th using the process outlined below.
- Submit all corrections to teacher rosters by October 30th using the process outlined below.
- Code.org will make corrections beginning in early November. Corrections will be visible in your Tableau data dashboard by the end of November.

**Step 1:** Navigate to the [Teacher Roster tab](https://us-east-1.online.tableau.com/#/site/codeorg/views/Regionalpartnerdatasharing/TeacherRoster?:iid=1) of your data dashboard and filter to the 2020-21 school year.

**Step 2:** Look for the following inaccuracies (for both CS Discoveries and CS Principles courses). Take note of teacher names and the email associated with the Code.org account they use to teach.

Teachers to add: 

- If a teacher is missing from your roster, perhaps because they attended another partner’s summer workshop, provide the details required in the form for us to add them. The address you provide should be associated with the Code.org account they use to teach. 

Teachers to remove: 

- It is possible that the same teacher might appear multiple times on your list if they enrolled in multiple workshops, either for the same program or both. Please identify these people so we can remove one of the two entries.
- Teachers that enrolled in a workshop but withdrew from the program before the summer workshop can be removed. You should not remove teachers that are no longer teaching the course or participating in PL for any reason. This information is important to retain for implementation rates.
- If someone that is not a teacher took attendance in a workshop (e.g. staff, facilitators, etc), they may appear on your roster. Please identify these people so we can remove them.

Teachers who are actually implementing, but are listed as having 0 students: 

- This can happen if a teacher is teaching under a Code.org account that is associated with an email address different from the one they used to enroll in your workshop. If you are able to give us the email address of the teacher’s Code.org account, we can link them in Tableau to display student progress.
- Note: Refer to the *Met Implementation Bar?* column for this process. Our data team is working on the issue causing the *Null* values in the *Highest Unit* column.

**Step 3:** Reach out to any teachers that are not implementing. Use this [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nR_851Tpb-5V6pYnw9rAry_UUuvKLNR2TU1W9ltiZfQ/edit) or create your own.

**Step 4:** Indicate the changes that you’re requesting to Code.org by completing [this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdKb2cHTPBu3kreR6PhsoSvMBBsipmkMEKgoOTKBPVXO0Sa8g/viewform?usp=sf_link) by October 30th.

**Step 5:** Review your final implementation rates. Code.org will notify you when your rosters have been corrected. This will be towards the end of November. Final scholarship payments, which are dependent on implementation rates, will also be calculated during that time.
