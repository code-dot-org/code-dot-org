## 2018 Summer Data Clean-up

Teacher data from your 2018-19 CS Principles and CS Discoveries local summer workshop or TeacherCon cohorts is now available in Tableau. We need your help to identify errors to be fixed so this data will be more useful to you long term. This is a one-time clean-up process that will give you a more accurate view into important metrics like implementation rate, URM student numbers, and overall program health. Changes that you’ve requested will be implemented by the Code.org data team and visible in your Tableau data dashboard by the end of November. 

Please navigate to the <a href="https://us-east-1.online.tableau.com/#/site/codeorg/views/Regionalpartnerdatasharing/TeacherRoster
" target=_blank>Teacher Roster tab</a> of your data dashboard and filter to this school year.

Note that there is a filter for each course, CS Discoveries and CS Principles, so you will need to repeat the following steps for each course. Please look for the following inaccuracies:

<details>
  <summary>Teachers who are actually implementing, but are listed as having 0 students</summary>
  <p> 
  
* This might occur if a teacher is teaching with a Code.org account that is different from the one they used to register for your workshop or TeacherCon. If you are able to give us the email address of the account the teacher is using to teach, we can fix their data in Tableau.
</p>

<details>
  <summary>Teachers to remove</summary>
  <p> 
  
* There may be some people that are included in the attendance for your workshop according to the dashboard, but shouldn't be listed as part of your cohort (e.g., novice and apprentice facilitators). Please identify these people so we can remove them.
* It is possible that the same teacher might appear multiple times on your list. Please identify these people so we can remove one of the two entries.
* You should not remove teachers that are no longer teaching the course or participating in PD for any reason. This information is important to retain for implementation rates.
</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Teachers to add</summary>
  <p> 

* If for any reason a teacher is missing from your roster, please provide their email address. The address you provide should be associated with the Code.org account they use to teach. 
</p>
</details>


**Data change requests will be accepted until November 9**. Indicate the changes that you’re requesting in **<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfyI2FIPoncROIZ3GDf0Uxt2W5OLqBvIjYUP8rONFc5qTp12w/viewform?usp=sf_link" target=_blank>this survey</a>**. 

Please also note that this process is for CS Discoveries and CS Principles programs only. We have not yet defined a process for CS Fundamentals teacher data.

## K-12 Computer Science Access Report
The CSTA and Code.org are partnering to create the first-ever comprehensive report of which schools offer computer science in the US. We are using a combination of crowdsourced surveys, data from curriculum providers like the College Board and data from state departments of education to get information about every school in the country. All the data we are gathering is made public on our site at <a href="http://code.org/yourschool" target=_blank>http://code.org/yourschool</a> and as regional partners, you have access to even more data via Tableau. Learn about how to access this data in the [Data Dashboard How-To Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14KgWKsfRuzC740lDZLlgjTpW4qZ-Wnt0U-v1xpNHjss/edit?ts=5a737737#)

The data we gather can be an incredible resource to you, but only if it is robust. We need your help gathering data about every school in the country!
