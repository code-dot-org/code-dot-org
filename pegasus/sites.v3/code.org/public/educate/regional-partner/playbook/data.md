## K-12 Computer Science Access Report
Which K-12 schools across the US teach computer science? Check out the map at <a href="https://code.org/yourschool#map" target=_blank>https://code.org/yourschool#map</a> to see data we've gathered so far.

The map shows a pin for every school in the US, color coded by whether or not they teach computer science and whether or not we have any data about that school.
