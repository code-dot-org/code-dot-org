## 2021 Fall Data Clean-up
The teacher roster for your 2021-22 CS Discoveries and Principles summer workshop cohorts are[ now available in Tableau!](https://bit.ly/teacher-roster) However, current data may contain errors that we need your help to identify. This is a one-time annual process that will give you a more accurate view into important metrics like implementation rate, student data, and overall program health. 

**Timeline**

- Review your teacher rosters and follow-up with teachers as needed, between now and <span style="color:#00abdc;">**August 31st [scholarship partners]**</span> and<span style="color:#00abdc;"> **September 10th [non-scholarship partners].**</span>
- Submit all corrections to teacher rosters [**using this form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd3II59hlNx-zjHL7pZ3QrkX-uZHu_bPKFw_mQaxePVQZs4lA/viewform) by <span style="color:#00abdc;">**August 31st [scholarship partners]** </span>and <span style="color:#00abdc;">**September 10th [non-scholarship partners].**</span>
- Code.org will make corrections beginning in September. Corrections will be visible in your Tableau data dashboard by the end of September.

Please Navigate to the [**Teacher Roster**](https://bit.ly/teacher-roster)  and look for the following inaccuracies: 

- **Teachers to add**: 
  - A teacher in your cohort attended another partner's summer workshopand needs to be added to your roster.
  - A teacher is missing from your roster for an unknown reason. 
- **Teachers to remove:**
  - A teacher attended your workshop as a guest from another Regional Partner and doesn't belong on your roster. 
- **Teachers to update:**
  - The wrong email address is listed for a teacher on the roster. 

Do you have other inaccuracies to flag? Most can be resolved by keeping the workshop dashboard and Code Studio up to date.
