# Using Data

Data informs district and school recruitment by supporting your case and aligning with districts needs. Data can move the needle for districts to implement CS and can show funders the impact of your program. Check out these resources on how you can add data to your recruitment plan.

## K-12 Computer Science Access Report

This is a report of which schools offer any computer science course in the US (including DOE data and survey data). See the Access Report section of the [2019 State of Computer Science Report](https://advocacy.code.org/2019_state_of_cs.pdf). All the data is made public on our site at <http://code.org/yourschool> and as regional partners, you have access to even [more data via Tableau](https://us-east-1.online.tableau.com/#/site/codeorg/workbooks/124362/views)!

Look in the [School-level filter](https://us-east-1.online.tableau.com/#/site/codeorg/views/Regionalpartnerdatasharing/School-levelFilter?:iid=3) view under “Computer Science Activities”. This includes all DOE data and survey data collected in your state and will show you which schools teacher computer science.

## 2019 Fall Data Clean-up
Teacher data from your 2019-20 CS Principles and CS Discoveries summer workshops are now available in Tableau. Use the steps outlined below to review your teacher roster and follow up with non-implementing teachers to see if they may be, or planning, to implement.

Note: We do expect to see a modest rise in your implementation rates since many CS Discoveries teachers are still starting to implement the online units through the end of October. You may still want to include these teachers in your follow-up with non-implementing teachers since it will be hard to know which teachers are implementing later than usual versus not at all.

**Timeline**
- Review your teacher rosters and follow-up with non-implementing teachers between now and November 8th using the process outlined below.
- Submit all corrections to teacher rosters by November 8th using the process outlined below.
- Code.org will make corrections after November 8th. Corrections will be visible in your Tableau data dashboard by the end of November.

**Step 1:** Navigate to the [Teacher Roster tab](https://us-east-1.online.tableau.com/#/site/codeorg/views/Regionalpartnerdatasharing/TeacherRoster?:iid=1) of your data dashboard and filter to the 2019-20 school year.

**Step 2:** Look for the following inaccuracies (for both CS Discoveries and CS Principles courses). Take note of teacher names and the email associated with the Code.org account they use to teach.
- Teachers to remove: Teachers not in your cohort (e.g., staff, facilitators, etc). Note: You should not remove teachers that are simply no longer implementing or attending PD. This information is important to retain for implementation rates.
- Teachers to add: Teachers missing from your cohort.
- Teachers listed with multiple email address: Identify which email they are using. We can then link their accounts so that they only appear once in your roster.
- Teacher listed in multiple courses: Identify the email address they are using to teach and what the correct course is for the teacher.
- Teachers who are implementing, but show 0 students: Identify which email they are using to teach and any other associated emails (e.g., a different email they used to register). We can link their account to show the number of students they are teaching.

**Step 3:** Reach out to any teachers that are not implementing. Use this [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nR_851Tpb-5V6pYnw9rAry_UUuvKLNR2TU1W9ltiZfQ/edit) or create your own.

**Step 4:** Indicate the changes that you’re requesting to Code.org by completing [this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdFDQhjYld7bJYAoD-aSSZwrIAP_OcqTcgvmQMNzDmsUhnH4w/viewform) by November 8th.

**Step 5:** Review your final implementation rates. Code.org will notify you when your rosters have been corrected. This will be towards the end of November. Group 1 & 2 Partners receiving scholarship funding for 2019-20 will get a specific email message to review their implementation rates and subsequent funding adjustments if any.

**Step 6:** Reflect on your recruitment strategies for 2020-21 and consider improvements you could make to increase implementation rates next year. Some things to consider:

- Make sure to get principal approval. Teachers are 9% more likely to implement if you get confirmation from the principal the course will be implemented.
- Find teachers who are teaching the right amount of hours and units ([implementation recommendations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DhvzoNElJcfGYLrp5sVnnqp0ShvsePUpp3JK7ihjFGM/edit)). Teachers are 5% more likely to implement if they are teaching to the implementation recommendations.
- Consider ways you can support and help administrators think about how to make implementation possible.
