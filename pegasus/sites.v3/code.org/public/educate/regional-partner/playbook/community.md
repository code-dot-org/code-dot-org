## Resources & Ideas
The following are a list of resources and ideas you can use to build your local community. Feel free to share more community ideas in the Google+ community!

- Start a virtual community using Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+, Edmodo, etc
- Create a regional competition alongside the [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com/us) in December
- Plan monthly school visits to support the teachers in your programs
- Join other tech meetups in your area. Check out [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/) to locate Tech or Education events near you!
- Go to a local [Computer Science Teacher Association (CSTA)](https://csta.acm.org/) chapter meeting
- Have an open house for parents and other community members to participate in an Hour of Code and find out more about computer science learning opportunities

## Community Events for Teachers
**What’s the goal?**<br/>
Teachers should feel supported as members of a teacher community. Use community events to foster that sense of support and community!

**Who’s included?**<br/>
Incorporate the diverse and varied computer science community in your events! Anyone who is interested in supporting computer science in the classroom should feel like they can attend.

**When to hold them?**<br/>
Hold at least 4 community events for teachers through the year.  Please ensure at least 3 of these events are spread out during the academic year.  We recommend 2 events during the "fall term" before December 31 and 2 events between January 1 and the end of the school year. 

**What's expected?**<br/>
All events should include teachers from your professional learning programs across CS Fundamentals, Discoveries, and Principles.  We also encourage you to open up these events to CS teachers outside your cohorts. Consider partnering with other organizations to host these events.

**How to get reimbursed:**<br/>
Code.org reimburses up to $500 for venue and catering per event that serves a minimum of 10 teacher attendees.  <br/>

Once you've held your event, please email invoices@code.org, cc'ing your regional manager with the following attachments: <br/>
1) Signup sheet with an accurate attendance count; <br/>
2) Invoice with the amount to be reimbursed and VERY brief description of the event (like Partner XX's 1st Quarter Community Meet Up); and <br/>
3) Receipts <br/>

Here are a few **examples of events** you can host to build teacher community.

- Ask a local company to host a meetup for your teachers at a restaurant or bar and have them bring in a speaker to talk about the work they do and how it is impacted by Computer Science.
- Find a local tech company or university to host a tour and information session so teachers can learn more about current research and trends in computer science careers and education.
- Host a [teacher hackathon](https://edtechhandbook.com/case-studies/remixed-how-to-host-an-education-hackathon/) at your location for CS educators in the area. It's a great way to network and encourage teachers to code and create!

## Computer Science Fair
In Year 2 of your partnership, hold a computer science fair showcasing students and student projects in your region.  See [this overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zdolbbIN8hQzfdivqHWTzNR-WdYQ8U3U19UTpYb20Wk/edit?ts=59c53f15) for more information and sample agenda.
