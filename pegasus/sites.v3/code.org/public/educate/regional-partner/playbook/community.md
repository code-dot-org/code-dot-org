**What’s the goal?**<br/>
Teachers should feel supported as members of a teacher community. Use community events to foster that sense of support and community!

**Who’s included?**<br/>
Incorporate the diverse and varied computer science community in your events! Anyone who is interested in supporting computer science in the classroom should feel like they can attend.

## Resources & Ideas
The following are a list of resources and ideas you can use to build your local community. Feel free to share more community ideas in the Google+ community!

- Start a virtual community using Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+, Edmodo, etc
- Have classrooms participate in the [Congressional App Challenge](http://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/compete-2016/)
- Create a regional competition alongside the [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com/us) in December
- Plan monthly school visits to support the teachers in your programs
- Join other tech meetups in your area. Check out [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/) to locate Tech or Education events near you!
- Go to a local [Computer Science Teacher Association (CSTA)](https://csta.acm.org/) chapter meeting
- Have an open house for parents and other community members to participate in an Hour of Code and find out more about computer science learning opportunities

## Community Events for Teachers
Here are a few examples of events you can host to build teacher community.

- Ask a local company to host a meetup for your teachers at a restaurant or bar and have them bring in a speaker to talk about the work they do and how it is impacted by Computer Science.
- Find a local tech company or university to host a tour and information session so teachers can learn more about current research and trends in computer science careers and education.
- Host a [teacher hackathon](https://edtechhandbook.com/case-studies/remixed-how-to-host-an-education-hackathon/) at your location for CS educators in the area. It's a great way to network and encourage teachers to code and create!
