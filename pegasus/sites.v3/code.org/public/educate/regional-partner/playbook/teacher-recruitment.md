### Teacher Application Rubrics

- <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=12Ntxq7TV1XYsD2eaZJVt5DqSctqR2hUj" target=_blank>CS Discoveries Teacher Application Rubric (PDF)</a>

### What does the application process look like?
Review the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bx-o1kRCKZxM_prrQqxQH7mXp9jXY0vT_eufgNpkKYM/edit?usp=sharing", target=_"blank">2019-20 Teacher Application Process Document</a> for everything you need to know about the Code.org teacher application process including finalizing your Local Summer Workshop dates, the list of teacher application questions and how they map to the rubrics, using the Code.org teacher applications system, and FAQs.

### What are the important dates I need to know about?
- **Two weeks** before your application open date your set-up forms are due. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_wJkryXiRLnH2tTaKMURR7x_LDmXq6zU/view", target=_"blank">Save this table</a> for a quick way to reference these important dates. 
- **Two months** prior to your Local Summer Workshops is the deadline for accepting a minimum cohort of teachers. This is to allow adequate time to go through the process of cancelling a workshop, if absolutely necessary, and reaccommodating teachers into another workshop outside your region.
- **Four weeks** prior to your Local Summer Workshop is the deadline for accepting teachers as this is also the deadline for ordering workshop supplies.  

### Application Links

## District Outreach

### The Outreach Pipeline
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cBSwosx1SNy7ydOjTrtYmeq6oZLkxSSHptGD3HfdtFM/view", target=_"blank">How to Bring Computer Science to a District</a><br/>
This document walks through the full outreach process, from identifying interested districts to closing a partnership to make CS accessable to all students.  It includes helpful questions to ask along the way, and list of issues to address at the district level and in individual school sites.

### Pitching Computer Science

<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PoCuK8zqQd_1m75deyJoUKbslybnBAWLOOoX4ww6NV0/edit?usp=sharing", target=_"blank">Code.org Why CS Pitch Deck</a><br/>
This is the slide deck Code.org uses to explain why computer science education is important and how a school/district can begin to implement computer science courses.

[Curriculum Details](https://code.org/educate/professional-learning-partner/playbook/curriculum)<br/>
 can be found on the curriculum tile of the playbook.  These one pagers and longer descriptions can be shared with decision makers that want to learn more about the Code.org courses and professional learning.

<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yMuKDTPWEVWVgHNi67v5sI3UR_W4hkh3dtHARtJIGJk/edit?usp=sharing", target=_"blank">CS Principles Curricula Comparison</a><br/>
An easy to read comparision of the most popular curricula for the AP CS Principles course.  Use this to explain the difference between programs.

<a href="https://k12cs.org", target=_"blank">CS Framework</a><br/>
The K–12 Computer Science Framework is a high-level guide for states, districts, and organizations implementing computer science education. Rather than an exhaustive list of computer science topics, the framework represents the essential ideas in computer science for all students. The framework is not a set of standards; rather, it provides an organizing structure and guidance for states and school districts to create their own standards. The framework also informs curriculum and professional development.

<a href="https://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/resources/microsoft_digitalskills_cs_toolkit_092018.pdf", target=_"blank">Microsoft Digital Skills Toolkit</a><br/>
A toolkit for middle and high schools to increase
diversity in computer science education.
