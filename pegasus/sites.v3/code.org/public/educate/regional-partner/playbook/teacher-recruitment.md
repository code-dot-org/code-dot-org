## District Outreach

### The Outreach Pipeline
[How to Bring Computer Science to a District](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cBSwosx1SNy7ydOjTrtYmeq6oZLkxSSHptGD3HfdtFM/view)<br/>
This document walks through the full outreach process, from identifying interested districts to closing a partnership to make CS accessable to all students.  It includes helpful questions to ask along the way, and list of issues to address at the district level and in individual school sites.

### Pitching Computer Science

[Code.org Why CS Pitch Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PoCuK8zqQd_1m75deyJoUKbslybnBAWLOOoX4ww6NV0/edit?usp=sharing)<br/>
This is the slide deck Code.org uses to explain why computer science education is important and how a school/district can begin to implement computer science courses.

[Curriculum Details](https://code.org/educate/professional-learning-partner/playbook/curriculum)<br/>
 can be found on the curriculum tile of the playbook.  These one pagers and longer descriptions can be shared with decision makers that want to learn more about the Code.org courses and professional learning.

[CS Principles Curricula Comparison](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yMuKDTPWEVWVgHNi67v5sI3UR_W4hkh3dtHARtJIGJk/edit?usp=sharing)<br/>
An easy to read comparision of the most popular curricula for the AP CS Principles course.  Use this to explain the difference between programs.

[CS Framework](https://k12cs.org)<br/>
The K–12 Computer Science Framework is a high-level guide for states, districts, and organizations implementing computer science education. Rather than an exhaustive list of computer science topics, the framework represents the essential ideas in computer science for all students. The framework is not a set of standards; rather, it provides an organizing structure and guidance for states and school districts to create their own standards. The framework also informs curriculum and professional development.


### Agreeing to Terms

[Sample Terms Sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vnRvVw0wPiWKqO22eIQaozcEnkNSHUdWqlk06Eoi_7E/edit?usp=sharing)<br/>
This sample terms sheet was shared at the Summit in September.  This includes the minimum that you'd want to have a new partner commit to doing, and should be used as a template that you build on as best for your organization.

[Example Terms Sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mdj_riHQuTxjg5_7jjbz_AjsqQuAtnJUR0uon-P7e1E/edit?usp=sharing)<br/>
This is an verson of the terms sheet that is filled out in detail.  It's a good example of what level of detail to look for when working with district partners.

[Terms Sheet With Errors](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gk3dpHgiH2D3tFS9nL-1k6ZwcfAfP6Op54shq-KWWBM/edit?usp=sharing)<br/>
This is the version of the terms sheet we looked at during the summit in DC.  It has common errors to watch out for, with explanation of why those errors are an issue.
