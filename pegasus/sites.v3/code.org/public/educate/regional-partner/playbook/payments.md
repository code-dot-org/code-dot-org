## Workshop Payments
Beginning with the 2020-21 Professional Learning Program year, all Code.org-funded Regional Partners will follow a scholarship model to receive funding for 6-12 cohorts.

Code.org funding for CS Fundamentals workshops is calculated by multipling a fixed amount of 70 by the number of teachers in attendance. 

**How you'll be paid**

- All payments are now made via ACH direct deposit through Bill.com.

**The Code.org Payment Cycle**
  
- For variable payments based on attendance, the Code.org payment cycle runs twice per month to capture workshops that took place between the 1st-15th and 16th-end of each month.
- At the close of a payment cycle, Code.org prepares a payment report, reviews it and initiates remittance via Bill.com.
- You will receive an email from Bill.com confirming the amount that has been deposited.


**Scholarship Funds**

- Refer to your 2020-21 MOU for the terms associated with your scholarships and the schedule on which they'll be paid.

## Facilitator Payments

 - Each Regional Partner is responsible for contracting with and paying any facilitators who run local workshops. (Note: this includes any out of region facilitators).
- Code.org will directly pay facilitators for Facilitator Development activities and events.
- If facilitators help with recruiting or other aspects of running the workshop, you should consider increasing their per workshop rate. 
 - Code.org will continue to pay for and provide swag and curriculum guides to all facilitators.

**CS Fundamentals Facilitator Travel Reimbursement Process**

Code.org will provide Partners with limited travel support for CS Fundamentals facilitators, up to, but not exceeding $500 dollars per facilitator per workshop, with the understanding that this should be around 30% of a Partner's workshops (ie. you should not be needing this travel support for every workshop you host).

Travel support will be provided by the following reimbursement process:

- Regional Partner should complete the form at [bit.ly/codeinvoices](http://bit.ly/codeinvoices) within 30 days of when the expenses were incurred.
- Invoice total can be up to 500 dollars.
- Reimbursable expenses include items like mileage, rental car, hotel, meals, etc. Refer to the 6-12 <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ichRN3P8XU71Ksr6VjejS6uYDK9yL3SMqEQjchm7xSo/edit" target=_blank>travel policy</a> for suggested guidance of reasonable expenses. Note that Egencia is not used for CS Fundamentals facilitator travel, yet. 
- Payment will be provided independent of the regular workshop payment that is generated automatically from the workshop dashboard.


**CS Principles and CS Discoveries Facilitator Travel Policy**

- Please be sure to review the CS Discoveries and CS Principles Code.org Travel policy <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ichRN3P8XU71Ksr6VjejS6uYDK9yL3SMqEQjchm7xSo/edit" target=_blank>here</a>.
- Facilitators will be responsible for booking travel according to the Code.org policy (if travel is covered by Code.org) or the Regional Partnerâ€™s own travel policy (if travel is covered by the Regional Partner).
- For the 2020-21 PL year, Code.org will fund all out-of-region facilitator travel.
