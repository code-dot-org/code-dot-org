## Workshop Payments

CS Fundamentals is the only program currently funded on a workshop-by-workshop basis. Funding terms are outlined [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tLPIsFjQh5-kJGG-2OlsYKQcIAnm1tGIVv1p21meXng/edit?userstoinvite=jacqueline@mindspark.org&ts=6019674f&actionButton=1#heading=h.36qqur89i3df) in the K-12 Funding for Regional Partners resource.  

**How you'll be paid**

- All payments are now made via ACH direct deposit through Bill.com.

**The Code.org Payment Cycle**
  
- For variable payments based on attendance, the Code.org payment cycle runs twice per month to capture workshops that took place between the 1st-15th and 16th-end of each month.
- At the close of a payment cycle, Code.org prepares a payment report, reviews it and initiates remittance via Bill.com.
- You will receive an email from Bill.com confirming the amount that has been deposited.

## Scholarship Payments
During the 2021-22 year, all Code.org-funded Regional Partners will follow a scholarship model to receive funding for 6-12 cohorts. Additional details are available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tLPIsFjQh5-kJGG-2OlsYKQcIAnm1tGIVv1p21meXng/edit?userstoinvite=jacqueline@mindspark.org&ts=6019674f&actionButton=1#heading=h.rvt9zhffkj0c) in the K-12 Funding for Regional Partners resource.
