## Teacher Workshops
Code.org pays Regional Partners for program expenses related to hosting workshops for teachers according to their contracts. These payments may include funds for facilitators at the workshops, costs for venue space and food during the workshop day, and compensation for time for a Regional Partner staff member to plan and execute the workshop.

We are transitioning all workshop payments to ACH Direct Deposit, allowing us to process payments more efficiently, provide better tracking, and allow Partners to receive their payments faster.

In order to make this transition, we will need you to submit your organization’s W9 and banking information through this secure <a href="https://na2.docusign.net/member/PowerFormSigning.aspx?PowerFormId=f26e94bf-8578-4b60-a263-7a246bee9ea4" target=_blank>DocuSign banking form</a>. Please respond to survey questions with information about your organization, and not your personal banking information.

- All CS Fundamentals workshops will be paid via ACH Direct Deposit effective immediately (April 4, 2018).
- All CS Discoveries and CS Principles workshops will be paid via ACH Direct Deposit starting June 1, 2018.
- For now, payments for CS Fairs, Community Events, workshop supplies lump sums for 6-12 Programs will still be paid via check and you should still follow all invoicing procedures (providing receipts, attendance, etc).
- Partners that have already submitted their ACH Direct Deposit information for CS Fundamental do not need to re-submit this form, unless there are changes you need to make for the 6-12 programs. Please email carol@code.org if you need us to route workshop payments for CS Discoveries and CS Principles to a different bank account. We will send you additional instructions (please don’t send banking information via email).  
- We will still issue payments twice a month: Code.org’s payment cycles are the 1st-15th and 16th-last day of each month. In the two weeks following, Code.org prepares a report and sends it with payment for all workshops closed in that prior period. For example: if a workshop was held July 11-12th, the cycle would close July 15th.

## Facilitators

**CS Principles and CS Discoveries Facilitator Payments**

- All CS Principles & CS Discoveries facilitators are paid $500 per workshop day.****
- Each Regional Partner is responsible for contracting with and paying any facilitators who run local workshops. (Note: this includes any out of region facilitators).
- Code.org will directly pay facilitators for any work they do at TeacherCon.
- Code.org will directly pay facilitators for any artifacts they produce as part of their Deeper Learning Plan.

**CS Fundamentals Facilitator Payments**

- CS Fundamentals facilitators are paid $400 for workshop facilitation.****
  - Note: CS Discoveries and CS Principles are paid $500 per workshop day, which is different from CS Fundamentals. Each CS Discoveries and CS Principles academic year workshop contains different content, so this payment includes the additional preparation required to deliver these workshops.
- Each Regional Partner is responsible for contracting with and paying any facilitators who run local workshops. (Note: this includes any out of region facilitators).
- Code.org will directly pay facilitators for Facilitator Development activities and events.
- If facilitators help with recruiting or other aspects of running the workshop, you should consider increasing their per workshop rate. Please reference Exhibit B in your CS Fundamentals MOU to see how the workshop payments received can support an increased rate.   
- Some facilitators will have a different payment structure because they work for a district.
Facilitators can host workshops that are not associated with their Regional Partner, but these will no longer be paid for by Code.org. Two common cases for this will be:
  - Working with another Regional Partner to help meet demand in their region
  - Facilitating a workshop for in-service elementary school teachers in districts that have funding to compensate the facilitator directly. In this case Code.org will strongly encourage actively coordinating and collaborating with the Regional Partner that covers that district.
  - Code.org will continue to pay for and provide swag and curriculum guides in both of these cases.

****This Code.org's general recommendation, and on a case-by-case basis, payment may differ.

**Timeline for the CS Fundamentals Funding Model Transition**


- February 2018 - Code.org is requesting facilitators to not schedule any more Code.org paid workshops or put them in the dashboard.
- As soon as March 9, 2018 - Regional Partners and facilitators can start workshops under this agreement and new funding model, in consultation together.
- No later than June 1, 2018 - host your first workshop in collaboration with your CS Fundamentals facilitator(s), *unless otherwise arranged with your Regional Manager.*
	- In some regions, there may be existing Code.org paid workshops that facilitators have already listed in the dashboard. We have clarified with facilitators that these can still be paid under existing facilitator agreements until September 1, 2018.
  - However, our expectation is that facilitators will work in close coordination with the Regional Partner to possibly transition these existing workshops to the new model where Regional Partners pay facilitators directly.

## Administrator and Counselor Workshops
**What will Code.org pay for?**

Code.org will pay for up to 80 individuals to attend an Administrator or Counselor workshop. This includes printed materials & swag.

**How payments are calculated**

Your total rate for 2 workshops has been divided by 80 and turned into a per person rate which will be paid based on the number of individuals who attend each session. This was done to enable each of you to run more than 2 workshops throughout your region while still receiving the same amount of compensation.

**Example:**<br/>
Per the MOU, Organization A is to receive:<br/>
Venue:  $400 x 2 workshops = $800<br/>
Food: 	 $20 per person x 80 people = $1,600<br/>
Staffer: $250 x 2 workshops = $500<br/>
Total:    $2,900

Per person rate Code.org will pay (up to 80 people): $2,900/80 = $36.25

**Can I Host Workshops for More than 80 People?**<br/>
Yes, but you will need to cover these costs.

For swag, you can order additional swag bags and pay for them yourself through Mimeo.
For printed materials, you can order additional through Mimeo and pay for them or make copies on your own.
Food, venue and staff time would also need to be covered by your organization.

**How will Code.org reimburse me for these workshops?**<br/>
Every payment cycle (~2.5 weeks), Code.org will pull attendance data from all dashboard workshops closed within the payment period. We will cut your organization a check for the number of attendees times your per person rate.<br/>

*Ex: Your organization's per person rate is $30pp. 25 idividuals register for your workshop, 20 show up and are marked attended by you in the dashboard. Code.org will send you a check for 20 * $30 = $600.*<br/>
