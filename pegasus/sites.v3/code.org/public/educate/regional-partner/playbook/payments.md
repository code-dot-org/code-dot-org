## Workshop Payments
Code.org pays Regional Partners for program expenses related to hosting workshops for teachers according to their contracts. These payments may include funds for facilitators at the workshops, costs for venue rental and food during the workshop day, and compensation for time for a Regional Partner staff member to plan and execute the workshop.

**How you'll be paid**

- All CS Fundamentals, CS Discoveries, CS Principles, and Admin/Counselor workshop payments are now made via ACH direct deposit (unless otherwise agreed with a partner).
- Payments for CS Fairs, Community Events, workshop supplies payments, and other reimbursements will still be paid via check. Complete the form at bit.ly/codeinvoices with your invoice, receipts and attendance list (if required) to initiate the payment process.

**When you'll be paid**

**Group 1 and 2 - Code.org Funded Partners:** All payments will be provided as outlined in the 2019-20 Regional Partner Agreement. Please refer to your agreements for detailed information on when payments will be disbursed and how final amounts will be calculated (Review exhibits that outline the Teacher Scholarship Fund, Scholarship Fund Implementation and Scholarship Fund Match).

**Group 3 and 4 - Code.org Funded Partners:**

**Local Summer Workshops:** Local summer workshop payment amounts will be calculated based on the details outlined in your Regional Partner Agreement.
- The Code.org payment cycle runs twice per month to capture workshops that took place between the *1st-15th* and *16th-last day* of each month.
- At the close of a payment cycle, Code.org prepares a payment report.
- You will receive an email from **workshoppayments@code.org** with summary payment details for each workshop that you ran during that period, with an opportunity to amend any incorrect information within 3 business days.
- After the review period, Code.org initiates remittance via ACH direct deposit and you will receive an email confirming the amount that has been deposited.

**Academic Year Workshops:** Academic Year Workshop payments have been split into two categories, Fixed Costs and Per Person (variable) Costs, which will be paid at different times. This information is outlined in amendments to the original Regional Partner agreements.
- Fixed Costs include facilitator, venue, and staffer pay, and will be paid in advance of your workshops, in 4 installments, at fixed times of the year (August 1, 2019, November 1, 2019, February 1, 2020, and April 1, 2020). 
- Per Person Costs include food payments, and will be paid 30 business days after the close of the payment cycle in which the workshop is held.
Payment amounts have not changed and will continue to be as outlined in your original agreement.

**General Note:**
If you hosted both K-5 and 6-12 workshops during a given payment cycle, you will receive two deposits in the amount due per batch of workshops.

**Paying Facilitators**: When you arrange for a facilitator to lead an upcoming workshop, please be upfront with them about the process and timeline for payments so they know:
	- how much they will be paid,
	- any steps they need to take to request payment (e.g., signing an invoice, submitting a timesheet, etc.), and
	- how many weeks after the workshop they can expect to receive payment.

## K-5 Facilitator Payments

- CS Fundamentals facilitators are paid $400 for workshop facilitation.*
  - Note: CS Discoveries and CS Principles are paid $500 per workshop day, which is different from CS Fundamentals. Each CS Discoveries and CS Principles academic year workshop contains different content, so this payment includes the additional preparation required to deliver these workshops.
- Each Regional Partner is responsible for contracting with and paying any facilitators who run local workshops. (Note: this includes any out of region facilitators).
- Code.org will directly pay facilitators for Facilitator Development activities and events.
- If facilitators help with recruiting or other aspects of running the workshop, you should consider increasing their per workshop rate. Please reference Exhibit B in your CS Fundamentals MOU to see how the workshop payments received can support an increased rate.
- Some facilitators will have a different payment structure because they work for a district.
Facilitators can host workshops that are not associated with their Regional Partner, but these will no longer be paid for by Code.org. Two common cases for this will be:
  - Working with another Regional Partner to help meet demand in their region
  - Facilitating a workshop for in-service elementary school teachers in districts that have funding to compensate the facilitator directly. In this case Code.org will strongly encourage actively coordinating and collaborating with the Regional Partner that covers that district.
  - Code.org will continue to pay for and provide swag and curriculum guides in both of these cases.

*This is Code.org's general recommendation, and on a case-by-case basis, payment may differ.

**CS Fundamentals Facilitator Travel Reimbursement Process**

Code.org will provide Partners with limited travel support for CS Fundamentals facilitators, up to, but not exceeding $500 dollars per facilitator per workshop, with the understanding that this should be around 30% of a Partner's workshops (ie. you should not be needing this travel support for every workshop you host).

Travel support will be provided by the following reimbursement process:

- Regional Partner should complete the form at [bit.ly/codeinvoices](http://bit.ly/codeinvoices) within 30 days of when the expenses were incurred.
- Invoice total can be up to 500 dollars.
- Reimbursable expenses include items like mileage, rental car, hotel, meals, etc. Refer to the 6-12 <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ichRN3P8XU71Ksr6VjejS6uYDK9yL3SMqEQjchm7xSo/edit" target=_blank>travel policy</a> for suggested guidance of reasonable expenses. Note that Egencia is not used for CS Fundamentals facilitator travel, yet. 
- Payment will be provided independent of the regular workshop payment that is generated automatically from the workshop dashboard.

## 6-12 Facilitator Payments

- All CS Principles & CS Discoveries facilitators are paid $500 per workshop day.*
- Each Regional Partner is responsible for contracting with and paying any facilitators who run local workshops. *(Note: this includes any out of region facilitators).*

<a id="612travel"></a>
**CS Principles and CS Discoveries Facilitator Travel Policy**

- Please be sure to review the CS Discoveries and CS Principles Code.org Travel policy <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ichRN3P8XU71Ksr6VjejS6uYDK9yL3SMqEQjchm7xSo/edit" target=_blank>here</a>.
- Facilitators will be responsible for booking travel according to the Code.org policy (if travel is covered by Code.org) or the Regional Partner’s own travel policy (if travel is covered by the Regional Partner).

*This is Code.org's general recommendation, and on a case-by-case basis, payment may differ.

## Administrator and Counselor Workshops
**What will Code.org pay for?**

Code.org will pay for up to 80 individuals to attend an Administrator or Counselor workshop. This includes printed materials & swag.

**How payments are calculated**

Your total rate for 2 workshops has been divided by 80 and turned into a per person rate which will be paid based on the number of individuals who attend each session. This was done to enable each of you to run more than 2 workshops throughout your region while still receiving the same amount of compensation.

**Example:**
Per the MOU, Organization A is to receive:<br/>
Venue:  $400 x 2 workshops = $800<br/>
Food: 	 $20 per person x 80 people = $1,600<br/>
Staffer: $250 x 2 workshops = $500<br/>
Total:    $2,900

Per person rate Code.org will pay (up to 80 people): $2,900/80 = $36.25

**Can I Host Workshops for More than 80 People?**

Yes, but you will need to cover these costs.

For swag, you can order additional swag bags and pay for them yourself through Mimeo.
For printed materials, you can order additional through Mimeo and pay for them or make copies on your own.
Food, venue and staff time would also need to be covered by your organization.

**How will Code.org reimburse me for these workshops?**
Admin/Counselor workshops will be paid the same way as K-12 workshops as outlined in the [Workshop Payments](#workshops) section above. Invoicing, rather than using the dashboard, should be reserved for special circumstances.

*Ex: Your organization's per person rate is $30pp. 25 individuals register for your workshop, 20 show up and are marked attended by you in the dashboard. Code.org will send you a check for 20 * $30 = $600.*<br/>
