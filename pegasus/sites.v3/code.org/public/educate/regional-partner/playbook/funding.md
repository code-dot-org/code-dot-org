# How does your organization become sustainable?

It's important to start thinking about how you will sustain these programs without our funding over time.

<a id="gettingstarted"></a>
### What can you do if you're just getting started?

- Create your prospect list of potential funders (who is likely to fund your Program Manager, etc.)
- Project how much you need and how much you can raise from this list in 3-4 months
- Start outreach to potential funders to pitch them through emails, calls or in person meetings
- Use a special event as your “closer” event

# Fundraising Playbook

When looking for donor support, it is important for your organization to understand the different types of donors. Each donor type may have different partnership expectations and giving trends that can either help or detract from your organization’s mission.

**Types of Support:**

- **Individuals:** “major donors” - high net worth/family foundations, “small” donors (typically online)
- **Corporate:** grant from corporation’s foundation or sponsorship (donation in exchange for benefits such as logos and other marketing / visibility)
- **Large National Foundations:** ex. Gates Foundation, Rockefeller, etc.
- **In-Kind:** donated products and services (ex. office space, software, catering, advertising)

Note: This list of revenue streams is not exhaustive, but outlines the types of revenue streams Code.org pursues. You could also explore: crowdfunding, employee matching/giving, planned giving, events/galas, etc). Your organization should decide what fundraising methods work best to achieve your mission.

## Types of Funders Definitions:

|Type of Funder | Definition|
|-----------------| ------------|
|**Major Donors** | Major giving is typically defined as high net worth individuals who donate to your organization. You can define what “major” means to you by creating different giving thresholds for your organization. Major giving donations are typically tax deductible and provide critical general operating support for your organization. At times, donors may want to restrict their giving to support a specific program. <br>*Individual Family Foundations are the giving arm of many “major donors”. High net worth individuals set up family foundations to distribute and manage their philanthropic giving*. |
|**Small Donors** | Small donors are your individual givers who give a smaller amount than a “major” donor. You decide what the definition of each donor and the associate giving threshold is. Typically, “small” donors give online (ex. monthly, yearly around the holidays, during a specific email campaign, crowdfunding campaign, etc.) and they are “stewarded” through ongoing emails and various communications (not a dedicated relationship manager).|
|**Corporations** | Corporate giving includes grants from corporate Foundations (ex. Verizon Foundation), where you develop a proposal or perhaps a partnership agreement to achieve certain goals to demonstrate the impact of their donation. Grants can be general operating or restricted giving. <br>*Sponsorship support is marketing focused donations from corporate Foundations or marketing departments where you promote the company’s association with your organization or campaign (ex. Corporation’s logo on campaign materials) in exchange for their sponsorship donation. Sponsorships are typically general operating support*.|
|**National Foundations** | Large national Foundations are often private, independent organizations that have missions of their own and core giving focus areas.|

## Strategy:

### Fundraising Strategy Best Practices:

- **Diversify your revenue streams:** ex. Code.org if funded by approximately 40% corporations, 40% foundations/high net worth individuals, 20% online donations
  * Having a mix of types of support creates more stable funding and reduces risk year over year
- **Program/mission focus:** Code.org best practice is lead with the ask with potential funders who have mutual goals, believe in your mission, and do not ask for you to stray away from your mission. Code.org does not pursue customized programs with funders, where the funder donates to create a specific program with the nonprofit. This enables us to stay focused on achieving our mission at scale, maintain lean fundraising operations/staff, and ultimately create more impact.
- **General operating support vs. restricted funding:** Code.org best practice is to try to maintain as much general operating support to allow your organization to stay flexible to meet the needs of your program goals, and maintain low overhead and staff to manage grants and donors
- **Multi-Year Grants:** if possible, try to secure multi year grants to advance your mission. This will help you raise funds more efficiently and be able to better project your future income and cash flow.


|Best Practices| |
|-----------------| ------------|
|**The Laws of Fundraising** | </ul><li> People give to people </li><li> People give because they are asked </li><li> 90% of the money comes from 10% of the donors</li><li>  People give to a winning cause</li><li> People give in relation to who asks</li><li>Giving is contagious </li><li> Previous donors are the best prospects</li><li> Personal visits result in larger gifts</ul>|
|**Requirements for Success** | **The Case:** Rationale behind initiative (compelling reason why to give). Educate the donor about the current issues and how your organization will help to solve a problem or advance your mission<br>**Tap Their Passion:** Ask the donor what they would like to change or preserve through donations to highlight their values and aspirations. How does the donor want to make a difference and how does that align with your mission?<br>**Leadership:** Those who advocate for the cause (internal and external)<br>**Prospects:** Identify potential partners who share your vision<br>**Plan:** Thorough strategy, clear demonstration of goals and outcomes, donor stewardship and fiscal integrity|
|**Four Step Donor Cultivation Process**|<ol><li> **Research:** identify potential donors</li><li>**Outreach:** share information</li><li>**Make the ask:** through meetings and proposals</li><li>**Stewardship:** thank your donors and provide updates</ol>|

# Research
The relationship between an organization and their donors should be based on clear communication and a partnership based in a common goal and mission. Throughout the research process to identify prospective donors, your organization will look at many different aspects of the prospective donor to assess if the donor is a good match for your organization.

## Prospective Research sheet:

1. Note the prospective organization or individual to be researched
2. Enter basic information into the prospective research tracking sheet
3. What to look for when filling out a donor research tracker:
</ul>

|Donor Information| What to look for|
|-----------------| ------------|
|**Contact info**| Names and bios of VIPs </ul><li>Any existing connection to your organization?</li><li>If not, look up the most senior executive who oversees philanthropy, corporate social responsibility or community giving</ul>|
|**Organization or individual interest areas**| </ul><li>Education (STEM / CS)</li><li>Diversity in tech</li><li>Underserved youth </li><li>Advocacy</li><li>Employee engagement / volunteer focus</li><li>Etc.</ul>|
|**Key geographic areas**|</ul><li>Do the funder's key markets align?|
|**Assets & revenue**| </ul><li>Year total net revenue: $ amount</li><ul><li>See public 990</ul></ul>|
|**Past Giving History**| </ul><li>Largest gift</li><li>Average gift</li><li>Description and links to any articles about previous relevant projects/initiatives and giving amounts</li><li>Previous relevant partnerships or partnerships</li><ul><li>Have they donated to any similar organizations? </ul>|
|**Application Process**| </ul><li>Eligibility requirements</li><li>Dates to apply</li><li>Etc.</ul>|



Overall, match level is based on the research areas aligning with your own organization's mission and application.

# Outreach
Outreach is the securing of initial calls and meetings with potential funders. Once you have your research completed and you have determined your “pipeline” i.e. target list of potential donors to reach out to, its time to make the ask.

## Basic Solicitation Cycle:
- Begin with thoughtful research to determine if potential donor is a good fit for your mission (see research template)
- Outreach to potential donor via email (an introduction from a mutual contact or Board Member is always helpful)
- Meet or schedule a call to determine interest and inclination of potential donor
  * Involve donor prospect substantively to determine partnership value and fit - ask questions on what goals they have, what are their pain points?
  * Demonstrate your organization’s accomplishments and share your community of supporters who help provide credibility
  * Show you address their goals and why your partnership is a good fit
  * Ask if you can follow up with another call, meeting, or proposal
- Develop a proposal (include $ ask)
- Follow-up, answer any questions, negotiate and secure the donation
- Thank and steward the donor throughout the year. Include an opportunity to engage directly with your programs or employee engagement. Email communications on your accomplishments and program updates and engaging key executives to learn more about your mission.
- Create Impact Reports/communications to demonstrate the value of the donor’s support
- Reach out and set up a call or meeting 6-9 months into your grant cycle to start having renewal discussions

<a id="ask"></a>
<br/>
# Making the ask
**Elevator pitch:** have a 30 second to 5 minute “pitch” following this high level framework. If you don’t have much time, focus on the the first three bullets. The goal is to get the potential donor excited enough to want to continue the conversation (via email, phone, in person meeting) until you secure the donation.

- Mission
- Strategy
- Why you address a need/solve a problem
- Accomplishments to date
- Program overview
- Expected outcomes/metrics
- Timeline
- Supporters
- Impact story

## Sales Materials:

|Type|Example|
|-----------------| ------------|
|**External**|Have sales tools to help you in your fundraising process:<ul><li>Video’s</li><li>PPT presentations</li><li>1 pagers|
|**Internal**|Help prepare your fundraiser with the tools and information s/he needs to secure donations:<br><ul><li>Sample Code.org [Speaking points](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1gtczphbvohu94r/Code.orgspeakingpoints2016.pdf?dl=0): It’s helpful to have some general speaking points to provide to any staff who are fundraising. You should create your own version.  </li><li>Share other helpful information such as organization “program overview” documents and links to websites with your fundraisers so they can stay informed and use them in pitch meetings and calls </li><li>Create sales material templates (ex. proposal, follow up email, reports) that you can customize for each potential partner to help create efficiencies|

<br/>
# Stewardship
Stewardship is the ongoing relationship you have with your donor after the gift is given. This includes updates on your organization's successes or upcoming events, executing grant deliverables, sending a charitable receipt or thank you, etc.

## Operations
Throughout the fundraising process (research, outreach, making the ask, stewardship), a customer relationship management (CRM) tool helps track prospects and donations for both reporting and acknowledgement purposes. Examples of CRMs: Salesforce, Raiser’s Edge, Insightly, Zoho CRM, and many more.

**Customer relationship management (CRM):** CRMs are used to track donations. Donations can be tracked in many different ways and can change based on what is best for your organization. Here is brief overview of basic donation tracking:


|Gift Status| Action|
|-----------------| ------------|
|**In&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussions / Soft Pledge**|A gift will be 'In Discussions' or 'Soft Pledge' if you are currently in discussions with the donor and have not yet agreed on a gift amount and/or other partnership deliverables <ol><li> Create prospect account (if it doesn’t already exist in CRM), and create an opportunity (donation) with “In Discussions” status</li><li>Create a note on opportunity to provide context of soft pledge (e.g. committed verbally on 1/1.)</ol>|
|**Hard Pledge**| A gift becomes a 'Hard Pledge' once an agreement is signed<ol><li>Update opportunity status in CRM from “In Discussions” to “Pledged” and attach supporting documentation (e.g. signed contract)</li><li>Update finance records of booked donation</li><li>Create tasks based on contract (e.g. reporting deliverables or website recognition)</ol>|
|**Received**| Once the gift is received, follow up with communication and acknowledgement<ol><li>Process payment (check, wire, online giving, stock, etc.)</li><li>Update opportunity status in CRM from “Pledged” to “Received”</li><li>Update finance records of received donation</li><li>Send thank you and charitable receipt to donor</ol>|

Not all donors are required to receive a charitable receipt (i.e. donations through corporate employee giving or donor advised funds, donations under $250, etc.). For more information, please visit IRS [documentation](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p1771.pdf) on charitable contributions substantiation and disclosure requirements.

# Supports for Pursuing Federal and State Grants

This resource has been created to provide regional partners who may be interested in pursuing federal or state grant funding with some basic guidance and suggestions on doing so. In many cases the language can also be applied to the pursuit of corporate, foundation, or individual funding.

The document has been organized to reflect the major sections typically associated with federal grant applications and will include a basic explanation of what the particular section is about, indicators of effectiveness, a few tips to keep in mind, and generic templates from which to build your specific proposal off of. Templates are meant to be examples and not prescriptive. In the end your proposal should uniquely reflect the strengths and resources of your organization and the efforts you will engage in both as a Regional Partner of Code.org and as a leader of computer science education in your region. It is up to you to determine how much you want to highlight your collaboration with Code.org or take a more general approach focusing on your organization’s efforts.

Click [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-F21aQTOmWuYt4l1wm8Ae2SrsGydBDoXiM7ifzCqsi0/edit#) to access the resource.
