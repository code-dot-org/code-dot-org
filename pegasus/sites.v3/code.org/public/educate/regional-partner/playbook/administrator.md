## Implementation Plan

### Creating an Appropriate Agenda
Each administrator and counselor workshop will be unique based on the amount of time alotted to the session and the audience that is present. We recommend using the following tools to plan your session.

## Securing a Venue
These guidelines will give your facilitators the space they need to run a successful workshop, as well as remind you of important factors to consider for logistics and participant experience. <br/>

| |Requirements and Suggestions|
|:-----|:-----------|
|Location|Keep these in mind:<br/><Br/> - Is the location central to the spread of attendees attending?<br/><Br/>- Catering: Are there several options nearby (within 20 miles)? Is there an internal or preferred caterer?<br/><br/> - Parking: Does it cost anything? Will attendees need passes? |
|Logistical Information|- Physical Address of Workshop<br/><br/>- Address to ship supplies (If needed)<br/><Br/> - Map of the Campus and/or building to help teachers find the room. Driving instructions should be provded to teachers. This can be done via Google Maps.<br/><br/> - Wifi strength and password. All participants will need to be on the network at the same time with no lag.<br/><br/> - Arrangments for Access: You should make arrangements with your venue contact to give you access to the building and help you locate supplies.|  |
|Rooms & Seating| Reservation time: <br/>- Be sure to book the room for 1 hour before and after your meeting time.<Br/> - We recommend the facilitators arrive 1 hour prior to set up and allow 1 hour after the workshop for cleaning up and questions.<br/><br/>Rooms Needed:<br/>- One room for entire group<br/>- Optional: Breakout room to set up catering and for eating. Hallway space also works. We want to avoid interrupting the session by setting up food in the room.<br/>- Wall space for hanging poster sized paper with Blue painter's tape<br/><br/>Seating<br/>- Group work style seating with tables that can seat 4-5 people each.|
|Technology <br/>Requirements| - Projector and Screen<br/> - Power outlets and Extention cords<br/> - Wifi that can support access by all participants<br/> |
