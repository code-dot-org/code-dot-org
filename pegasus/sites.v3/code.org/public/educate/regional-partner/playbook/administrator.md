## Securing a Venue
These guidelines will give your facilitators the space they need to run a successful workshop, as well as remind you of important factors to consider for logistics and participant experience. <br/>

| |Requirements and Suggestions|
|:-----|:-----------|
|Location|Keep these in mind:<br/><Br/> - Is the location central to the spread of attendees attending?<br/><Br/>- Catering: Are there several options nearby (within 20 miles)? Is there an internal or preferred caterer?<br/><br/> - Parking: Does it cost anything? Will attendees need passes? |
|Logistical Information|- Physical Address of Workshop<br/><br/>- Address to ship supplies (If needed)<br/><Br/> - Map of the Campus and/or building to help teachers find the room. Driving instructions should be provded to teachers. This can be done via Google Maps.<br/><br/> - Wifi strength and password. All participants will need to be on the network at the same time with no lag.<br/><br/> - Arrangments for Access: You should make arrangements with your venue contact to give you access to the building and help you locate supplies.|  |
|Rooms & Seating| Reservation time: <br/>- Be sure to book the room for 1 hour before and after your meeting time.<Br/> - We recommend the facilitators arrive 1 hour prior to set up and allow 1 hour after the workshop for cleaning up and questions.<br/><br/>Rooms Needed:<br/>- One room for entire group<br/>- Optional: Breakout room to set up catering and for eating. Hallway space also works. We want to avoid interrupting the session by setting up food in the room.<br/>- Wall space for hanging poster sized paper with Blue painter's tape<br/><br/>Seating<br/>- Group work style seating with tables that can seat 4-5 people each.|
|Technology <br/>Requirements| - Projector and Screen<br/> - Power outlets and Extention cords<br/> - Wifi that can support access by all participants<br/> |
