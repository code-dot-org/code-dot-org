South Carolina<br/>

The Citadel, a master-level public institution in Charleston, SC, was founded in 1842. A unique military-style educational system has been adopted, with the mission of educating principled leaders. Today, the student body consists of approximately 2300 undergraduate cadets and other day students (such as veterans), and a growing body of evening undergraduate and graduate students. The Citadel has been recognized as the best master-level public institution for the South the last five years by US News & World Report, in large part due to the freshman retention rate of 86% and four-year graduation rate of 59% (second highest of all South Carolina’s colleges). The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science offers a Bachelor's and Master's in Computer Science, in addition to 3 CS-related minors and graduate certificate in Cybersecurity.  Due to the military affiliation of the campus, cybersecurity has become a popular topic and is taught on campus from both the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science and Department of Criminal Justice.  The Citadel has been designated as NSA/DHS Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense Education (CAE-CDE) in 2016. Additionally, the STEM Center of Excellence provides teacher professional development and student summer camps in computer science and cybersecurity.
