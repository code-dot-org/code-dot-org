## Regional Partner Advisory Committee

**Concept**

As the Regional Partner program continues to mature and expand, Code.org will look to our partners for leadership and advice.

**Purpose**

The purpose of the Regional Partner Advisory Committee is to provide guidance and feedback on Code.org programs, tools, and processes. Input will be used to inform change and develop new program features. Code.org may consult the committee to better understand the impacts of changes and decisions on Regional Partners.
