### **2017 Annual Report Requirements**

Each Partner will produce an annual report that includes the following:<br/>


- Short narratives about each of the workshops held<br/>
- Completed Regional Partner Roadmap to be used as part of your professional development. <br/>
- Short narratives about each of the four community events that were held.<br/>
- Summary of survey data provided by Code.org through the Dashboard, and how that data influenced decision making.<br/>

**Please ask your Regional Manager for a copy of the annual report template specific to your group.** It is important that you use this template to complete your report.

### **2016-2017 Data Collection Information**
Code.org will be collecting data on how teachers felt about workshops and implementation in three ways:

- Automatic surveys at the end of each workshop. 
- Surveys we will send out to all teachers sometime in the fall. 
- Direct look up on Code Studio. 

[This document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1881ECNGv4tyIzatqHj1bWKm73e16Zq7uVEoPItqXmiY/edit?usp=sharing) describes the details on those three approaches. Weâ€™re committed to making our evaluation public, and will post the results to our website once completed and published. You can see our previous reports [here](https://code.org/about/evaluation).
