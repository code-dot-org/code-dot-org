### **My region is already served by another organization, can we still apply to be a Regional Partner?**

For this year, we are only looking for Regional Partners in regions where Code.org is not already working with another organization. If you are interested in participating in local Professional Learning for the 2020-21 school year, please email partner@code.org and we will connect you with the Regional Partner for your area.
