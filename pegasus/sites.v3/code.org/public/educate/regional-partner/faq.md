### **My region is already served by another organization, can we still apply to be a Regional Partner?**

We are only looking for Regional Partners in regions where Code.org is not already working with another organization. If you are interested in participating in local Professional Learning for the 2021-22 school year, please email partner@code.org and we will connect you with the Regional Partner for your area.

### **Do you accept international applications?**

The Regional Partner Program is only open to organizations in the United States. While the Regional Partner Program continues to focus on organizations based in the U.S., there are many ways for non-U.S. organizations to partner with us. Please check out [code.org/international](http://code.org/international) for more information.
