# Regional Partner Program

## About the Program

Code.org partners with select United States-based organizations to help spread computer science in a local, sustainable fashion. Our network of Regional Partners are working towards the goal that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science. As an established K-12 computer science hub for their region, Regional Partners offer professional learning opportunities for teachers and building a strong local community.

The current network includes 57 partners representing 49 states.
