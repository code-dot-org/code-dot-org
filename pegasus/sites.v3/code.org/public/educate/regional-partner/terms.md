## Joint Commitment
- We will work together to ensure that these professional learning programs are fully funded by means other than Code.org before the July 2020.
	- The vision is long-term funding will come from federal, state or local sources. We expect Regional Partners will lead the fundraising in your local area. Code.org can provide guidance, introductions, sample grant applications, etc. as needed, and establish the Regional Partner as a Code.org-accredited provider. In some regions, Code.org may also be able to connect Regional Partners to local funders.
- We will collaborate to establish your organization as a certified Regional Provider of computer science Professional Learning, so teachers from local districts can receive formal credit for participating in workshops.
- We will cooperate to identify, recruit, build and maintain local facilitator capacity. Facilitators need to meet Code.org’s established selection criteria and maintain "good standing".
- We will collaborate (within the legal constraints of the respective organizations) on K-12 computer science policy-related matters that our respective organizations are working on in the state.  

**We view this as a long-term partnership.**
We see your organization joining a network of organizations supporting a nationwide movement to build local computer science hubs. We hope to find many ways beyond the scope of this document to cooperate in spreading computer science in K-12 schools.


This is not a binding document. Code.org may change some of these terms in subsequent years.

**Next Steps:** If your organization agrees to these terms, please complete [an application](/educate/regional-partner/apply) to become a Code.org Regional Partner.
