## Your Commitment (Regional Partner)

### Staffing ###
* Provide a dedicated Regional Partner Program Manager who will participate fully in the Program Manager onboarding & on-going program management responsibilities. (up to 0.5 of an FTE’s time - this can be shared across one or more staff members of your organization).</br>

### Outreach ###
- Develop a plan for expansion of local computer science</br>
- Establish partnerships with local districts and schools to commit to send teachers to Computer Science professional learning workshops.</br>
- Recruit a minimum of 10 teachers per professional learning program, who are all committed to implementing the program in the following school year

### Community ###
- Build, grow and sustain a local community of computer science educators (or join an existing community)</br>
	- In Year 1 (2016-17): organize informal local meetups for educators, ideally together with a local university or corporation and promote the December Hour of Code campaign locally.</br>
	- In Year 2 (2017-18), also organize and host a spring “CS Fair” for schools.

### Funding ###
- Use existing funding and finance infrastructure to cover up-front workshop costs and pay facilitators and teachers prior to Code.org reimbursement.

### Metrics/Evaluation ###
- Establish and meet detailed metrics on growth of number of participating teachers and students in the region, implementation of courses, diversity, and quality of workshops.</br>
- Commit to ongoing communication with Code.org on metrics and model improvements, as necessary.</br>

## Code.org Commitment

### Partner Development ###
- Host the Facilitation Summit
- Pay for round-trip airfare, hotel, ground transportation to and from the airport, and meals during the Facilitation Summit, the summer workshop and the Program Manager Summit in Year 1 of the partnership.
- Host the 5-day Code.org TeacherCon for CS Principles and CS Discoveries in Year 1 of the partnership.
- Host 2-day Program Manager Summit.

### Outreach ###
- Provide promotional materials to assist in community-building, teacher recruitment and district recruitment.
- Where we have existing relationships, introduce the Regional Partner to local school districts interested in bringing computer science workshops to their teachers.
- Mentor the Regional Partner on how to work with and recruit school districts.
- Coach and provide tools for the Regional Partner on teacher recruitment, facilitator capacity, funding, regional CS expansion and community building and reputation.
- Authorize use of the “Code.org Regional Partner” logo on promotional materials the Regional Partner develops.

### Community ###
- Support an online community for all programs.

### Funding ###
- For each cohort of teachers, Code.org will work with the partner to determine how much funding to provide based on demonstrated need to cover the following: an onsite staffer, facilitator compensation, food, and venue. You may work out a different schedule of workshops with the local school districts, as long as it’s within these costs.
- Provide access to workshop supplies as well as materials for teachers such as a virtual curriculum guide containing course lesson plans, certificates of completion, and classroom supplies for some activities.

### Metrics/Evaluation ###
- Evaluate your success based on shared metrics (noted above) -- growth of number of teachers and students in the region, implementation of courses, diversity, and quality of workshops.

## Joint Commitment
- We will cooperate together to transition your work to 100% local funding by year 3 of the partnership. Our vision for this is that the long-term funding comes from state or local sources but we expect that you will lead the fundraising in your local area. We can provide guidance, introductions, sample grant applications, etc. as needed, and establish you as a Code.org-accredited provider. In some regions, we may also be able to connect you to local funders.
- We will collaborate to establish your organization as a certified regional provider of computer science PD, so teachers from local districts can receive formal PD credit.
- We will cooperate to identify, recruit, build and maintain local facilitator capacity. Facilitators need to meet Code.org’s established selection criteria.


We view this to be a long-term partnership. We see your organization as joining a network of organizations supporting a nationwide movement to build local computer science hubs. We hope to find many ways beyond the scope of this document to cooperate in spreading computer science in K-12 schools. That could mean hosting workshops for elementary school teachers, cooperating on state level policy efforts, or more. For now, we want to focus on a limited set of work to begin our relationship.

This is not a binding document. This is a new program, so Code.org may change some of these terms in subsequent years.
