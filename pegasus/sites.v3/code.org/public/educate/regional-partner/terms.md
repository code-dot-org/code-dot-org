## Joint Commitment
- We will collaborate to establish your organization as a certified Regional Provider of computer science Professional Learning, so teachers from local districts can receive formal credit for participating in workshops.
- We will cooperate to identify, recruit, build and maintain local facilitator capacity. Facilitators need to meet Code.org’s established selection criteria and maintain "good standing".
- We will collaborate (within the legal constraints of the respective organizations) on K-12 computer science policy-related matters that our respective organizations are working on in the state.  

**We view this as a long-term partnership.**
We see your organization joining a network of organizations supporting a nationwide movement to build local computer science hubs. We hope to find many ways beyond the scope of this document to cooperate in spreading computer science in K-12 schools.


This is not a binding document. Code.org may change some of these terms in subsequent years.
