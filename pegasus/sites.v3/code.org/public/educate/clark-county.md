# Teach Computer Science at Your School

## Why computer science?

Computer science opens more doors for students than any other discipline in today’s world. Learning even the basics will help students lead in virtually any career  from architecture to zoology.

## Professional development — at no cost to schools

Participating teachers consistently call our professional development, "The best professional development I've ever had!" Training for next school year begins in May.

## Clark County teachers:

Code.org has partnered with Clark County School District. We're looking for more local teachers to join professional development programs.

### Grades K-5 (open to all elementary school teachers, in any district)

Code.org offers an elementary school curriculum that allows even the youngest students to explore the limitless world of computing. Courses blend online, self-guided and self-paced tutorials with “unplugged” activities that require no computer at all.

- One-day professional development workshops prepare teachers to start teaching each of our courses
- Each course consists of 20 lessons that can be incorporated into any classroom at any pace
- Even kindergarten-aged pre-readers can participate<br />
