<br/>

1. If you want to take public transportation the venue is 1 block away from the Grand Avenue Red Line Stop.


2. Parking Recommendations.  
Use SpotHero.com to reserve a parking space in a nearby surface lot or garage at a low rate.  You should be able to find something around $18 for the day.  The closest spot hero lot is across the street from the office at 430 N Rush St.  There are cheaper places to park that are a bit further away.

Street/meter Parking is generally available on Wabash right in front of the office, but you'll need to use the City of Chicago Parking app to park for longer than two hours.  It's also a $4/hr zone.
