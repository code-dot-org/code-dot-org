### Phase 4: Summer Wrap-up (3 days in-person - Summer 2016)

Phase 4 of professional development is an in-person workshop focused on diving deeper into content and material that was difficult to teach the first time and empowering teachers to take ownership of the curriculum by making adjustments and changes in order to meet their students’ needs. Phase 4 addresses curricular materials with an eye for teaching and learning in context. Teachers will reflect on what success looks like in an AP course and how to recruit diverse groups of students.<br/>

Takeaways:<br/>
• I look forward to teaching the course again based on my
reflection of the past year.<br/>
• I am confident in supporting my students through
all of the AP assessments.<br/>
• I am more comfortable with the material that
I struggled with the first time teaching
this course.<br/>
• I understand how to make changes
to the Code.org curriculum in order
to meet my students’ needs and fit
into my local context.<br/>
