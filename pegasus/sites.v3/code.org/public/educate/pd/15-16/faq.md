**Who do I inform if I have a schedule conflict?**

Please email pd@code.org and your district contact if you have a conflict with an in-person PD date. Unfortunately, you can't make up the workshop. We recommend that you connect with a colleague to catch up on important concepts. You can do this locally or through your nation-wide forum of CS teachers. Visit your program's forum below:

**What is the payment process?**

### Teacher Payment Process (for those being paid directly by Code.org) ###

Teachers will be paid their stipend at the completion of Phase 1: Online Introduction according to their district's payment policy.
</br>
*Note: Phase 1 must be complete in order to receive payment for Phase 2.*

Payments will be made twice a month either directly to the teacher or to the district who will then make payments to teachers:

•Cycle 1: 1st - 15th of each month (payments are deposited in accounts or mailed to the district within 10 business days after the end of the cycle).

•Cycle 2: 16th - last day of each month (payments are deposited in accounts or mailed to the district within 10 business days after the end of the cycle).

If, for example, a teacher finishes Phase 1 on Wednesday, May 20, the payment will be made by Monday, June 10th. 
<br/>
<br/>
*Note: Code.org is not responsible for delays in payment from districts to teachers. If your district pays you directly, please contact your district finance department with any payment delay questions.*

### Code.org Teacher Payment options: ###
Teachers that are paid directly by their Districts can be found on [this list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O1rvNDZ_TfAOfvxQG2wqi9BqG3JsrxG1BV9TruBpt3s/edit?usp=sharing). 
<br/>
<br/>
Teachers being paid directly by Code.org can select from the following payment options.
<br/>
<br/>
**Direct deposit:** This is the fastest and easiest way to get paid. When registering through the [educator information form](https://code.org/educate/educatorinfo)* displayed at the end of phase 1 pd, teachers input the requested bank account information and their stipend will be placed directly into their bank account within 10 days of the close of the payment cycle.

**You may receive a message saying that "you can only submit one entry for this form", if you feel like the information that you orignally entered was not correct then you can email [PD@code.org](PD@code.org) and we will be happy to assist you.* 

**Pre-paid debit card:** Choosing this option will add 4-6 weeks to the payment process and the card will be sent via mail after processing.

**What if I am no longer teaching the course in the Fall, can I still attend PD?**

Our general rule is you will not go through PD unless you are teaching the course, but please contact your district to discuss further.
