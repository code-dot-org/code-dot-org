### **I have a schedule conflict with my workshop date. What should I do?**

Please email pd@code.org *and* your district contact with the workshop date and the reason you cannot attend. <br/><br/>
Unfortunately, you can't make up the workshop. Here are some recommendations for how you can connect with a colleague to catch up on important concepts:<br/> 
1) Locally: Connect with a colleague from your local cohort<br/>
2) Virtually: Connect to your nationwide network of CS teachers through your program's forum: <br/>

### **I am no longer teaching the course. Can I still attend PD?**

Our general rule: We do not pay a stipend to teachers who are not teaching the course.  However, you are welcome to attend the PD, unpaid, as a guest. Please contact you district if you have specific questions about this.

### **Winter Weather Policy**
If a workshop is cancelled due to weather or an unexpected event, Code.org will notify you via email by 10pm the night before PD. If PD is cancelled and not rescheduled for a later date, teachers will still receive the PD stipend. <br/>

Code.org’s goal is to ensure your safety in an emergency situation. Please remember to update [pd@code.org](pd@code.org) with any email or phone changes you may have.

<br/>
<br/>
**Phase 1 and Phase 2 online PD** was due on September 7, 2015. Use [this tutorial](#complete) to make sure you completed both Phase 1 and Phase 2. 
<br /><br/>
**Phase 3 online PD** due dates vary by program (see below). Add these launch dates and due dates to your calendar to best coordinate your online professional development and classroom implementation. We recommend that you complete your online PD courses before you implement the respective curriculum. <br /><br />
Payments for Phase 3: Academic Year Development online PD will be pulled twice during the year - February 1st (for work completed before January 31st) and July 1st (for work completed before June 30th). These cycles were designed to give you flexibility to synch your online PD with your classroom implementation.

<a id="pay"></a>
### **What is the payment process?**
NOTE: CodeVA dates & deadlines for payments & online PD do not align to those listed on this FAQ.
<br/>
<br/>
**Teacher Payment Process**

**Phase 1 and Phase 2**: Teachers will be paid their stipend at the completion of Phase 2: Blended Summer Study according to their district's payment policy.
</br>
*Note: Phase 1 must be complete in order to receive payment for Phase 2.*

**Phase 3**: Teachers will be paid *separately* for their in-person and online PDs. 
<br />
•In-person: Teachers will be paid for in-person PD in the cycle (see below) following their workshop. Teachers *must* complete the workshop survey distributed at the end of the session in order to receive their stipend. 


•Online: Payment for Phase 3 online PDs will be pulled twice during the academic year - once in the winter and once in late spring. *Note: This does not follow the typical bimonthly payment cycle listed below.* 
<br /> <br />
**Payment Cycles** <br />
Payments will be made twice a month either directly to the teacher or to the district who will then make payments to teachers:

•Cycle 1: 1st - 15th of each month (payments are deposited in accounts or mailed to the district within 10 business days after the end of the cycle).

•Cycle 2: 16th - last day of each month (payments are deposited in accounts or mailed to the district within 10 business days after the end of the cycle).

If, for example, a teacher finishes Phase 1 on Wednesday, May 20th and goes through Phase 2 on June 1st-5th, the payment will be made or mailed by Thursday, June 25th. 
<br/>
<br/>

**Code.org Teacher Payment options:**

**Districts paying their teachers directly** can be found on [this list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O1rvNDZ_TfAOfvxQG2wqi9BqG3JsrxG1BV9TruBpt3s/edit?usp=sharing), sorted alphabetically by state. 

*Note: Code.org is not responsible for delays in payment from districts to teachers. If your district pays you directly, please contact your district finance department with any payment delay questions.*
<br/>
<br/>
Teachers being **paid directly by Code.org** can select from the following payment options:
<br/>
<br/>
**Direct deposit:** This is the fastest and easiest way to get paid. When registering through the [educator information form](https://code.org/educate/educatorinfo)* displayed at the end of phase 1 pd, teachers input the requested bank account information and their stipend will be placed directly into their bank account within 10 days of the close of the payment cycle.

**You may receive a message saying "you can only submit one entry for this form." If you feel like the information that you orignally entered was not correct, see ["I need to update bank account information, where do I go?"](#acct)* 

**Pre-paid debit card:** Choosing this option will add 4-6 weeks to the payment process and the card will be sent via mail after processing. Teachers choosing this option will receive one debit card the first time they are paid, and we will continue to refill that *same* card throughout your PD.

**PD Updates Archive:** [October](http://us9.campaign-archive1.com/?u=dc783682a08c5eb6dfe447070&id=55391a06c1) | [November](http://us9.campaign-archive2.com/?u=dc783682a08c5eb6dfe447070&id=579295973d) | [December](http://eepurl.com/bIdV5T)  | [January](http://eepurl.com/bN6TzT)

### **How can I find disappearing buttons**
Are your students’ Setup and Forever buttons disappearing? Resize the window when widgets disappear. This should make the buttons reappear. 

Why does this happen? The cause of widgets disappearing is a faulty draw by the Flash renderer when a widget is partially offscreen. Usually it is a graph that is partially offscreen that confuses Flash. Resizing the window should fix the problem.

### **How do I set up student accounts on StarLogo Nova?**
There are 4 options for setting up student accounts on StarLogo Nova. <br/>

**CASE 1: Your school does not allow students to have their own logins and passwords.**
<br/>
<br/>
In this case, you, as the teacher, can create a class account and have all of your students login to that account.  For example, you'd create a login for your 4th period Integrated Science course called “Integ.Sci.period4.” When saving project files, ask students to include their names in the project file such as “Danny and Emma’s ecosystem model - IntegSciPeriod4.”  As a teacher, you can review all of the student projects in this account. A side effect to be aware of is that all students will be able to see and modify each others work.
<br/>
<br/>
**CASE 2: Students create their own accounts using school issued ID number.**
<br/>
<br/>
On the first day of class (to use the Project GUTS Code.org modules with StarLogo TNG), have your students create logins and passwords on slnova.org.  Their logins can be their first and last names and their passwords can be their school issued ID number.
<br/>
<br/>
**CASE 3: Students create their own accounts with their own passwords.**
<br/>
<br/>
- Make note of login and password for students (they may lose or forget them)<br/>
- Students need to make their project public and add the teacher as a collaborator
<br/>
<br/>
**CASE 4: Teacher makes accounts for students using teacher issued password.**
