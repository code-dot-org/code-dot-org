# Code.org Professional Development Resources

Code.org professional development is a multi-phase program designed to provide educators with the opportunity to increase content knowledge, skills, and pedagogy related to inquiry, equity, and specific Code.org course instruction. The professional development model is structured to empower teachers by focusing on proper preparation, in-depth learning, feedback, reflection, and continuing education.  Teachers are required to successfully complete course-specific Code.org professional development for each Code.org course they will instruct.
