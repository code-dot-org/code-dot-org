## What is computer science?
Computer science is about learning how to build technology that'll change the world as we know it. It covers how the Internet works, how to analyze big data and how computers impact our lives. Students also learn to code as a tool to create the programs, games and apps of the future.

## Middle School Computer Science Program

### [CS in Science](http://code.org/curriculum/mss)

Code.org has partnered with the award-winning Project GUTS (Growing Up Thinking Scientifically) to deliver a middle school science program consisting of four instructional modules and professional development for the introduction of computer science concepts into science classrooms within the context of modeling and simulation. The goal of the program is to situate computer science practices and concepts within the context of life, physical, and earth sciences and prepare students to pursue formal, year-long courses in computer science during high school. CS in Science is aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards.

### [CS in Math](http://code.org/curriculum/msm)

Code.org has partnered with [Bootstrap](http://www.bootstrapworld.org/) to offer a curriculum module which teaches algebraic and geometric concepts through computer programming. Bootstrap focuses on order of operations, the Cartesian plane, function composition and definition, and solving word problems within the context of video game design. By shifting classwork from abstract pencil-and-paper problems to a series of relevant programming problems, Bootstrap demonstrates how algebra applies in the real world, using an exciting, hands-on approach. The CS in Math module is aligned to the Common Core Standards for Mathematics. Visit the [CS in Math](http://code.org/curriculum/msm) program page.
