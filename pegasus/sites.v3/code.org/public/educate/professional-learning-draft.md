* Throughout the year, we offer online support for upcoming units, forum support, and follow-up workshops

**We have two course options:**
* For younger students, our [Computer Science Discoveries curriculum](/educate/csd) is designed for educators in 6th - 10th grade classrooms. The course can be taught as a semester or full-year introduction and covers a broad range of topics such as physical computing, building websites, programming, and learning about data.
* Our [Computer Science Principles curriculum](/educate/csp) is also an introductory course that requires no computer science background (from students or teachers). It can be taught as an AP or non-AP course, and is designed for educators in 9th - 12th grade classrooms. More than a traditional introduction to programming, it is a rigorous, engaging, and approachable course that explores many of the foundational ideas of computing so all students understand how these concepts are transforming the world we live in.
