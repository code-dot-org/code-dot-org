## Funding for computer science programs

U.S. Federal law recently recognized [computer science as part of the "well rounded education subjects"](http://blog.code.org/post/134932134563/sweeping-us-education-law-adds-computer-science), and explicitly [names computer science as an important STEM field](http://blog.code.org/post/130358071518/computer-science-is-finally-included-in-stem).

Your school or district may be able to use Title I or Title II funds, and other department grant programs to apply towards offering CS courses. [More info](http://innovation.ed.gov/2015/12/07/a-new-chapter-for-computer-science-education/).
