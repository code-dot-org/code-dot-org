* Would you like to meet tech industry experts and ask them questions about their jobs?


<p>You should join the inaugural <b>Code.org Student Advisory Council</b>! Code.orgâ€™s Student Advisory Council is a group of students who will meet monthly to discuss their experiences with the curriculum, build community with peers, and share feedback with the Code.org team. <br><br><p>

As part of the Student Advisory Council, you will directly communicate with the curriculum developers and engineers behind what you learn in your classroom. Student voices from the council will be critical in ensuring that our CSA curriculum is in its best shape when we officially launch it in Summer 2022! <br><br><p>

You will also get a chance to meet and talk with professional software engineers about their experiences. As a thank you for your time, we will provide a certificate with service hours, as well as Code.org swag!
