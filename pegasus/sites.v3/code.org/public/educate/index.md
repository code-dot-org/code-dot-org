# All resources for educators

[/tight-heading]

Whether you're a school teacher, an administrator, an after-school teacher, or a volunteer, Code.org provides educational resources for all ages, free of cost. Below is a summary of our curriculum and other programs. Our online courses on [Code Studio](http://studio.code.org) are meant for use in all settings &mdash; in-school, home-schooling, after-school &mdash; and can be taught by teachers, parents or volunteers. 

<!-- If you're a parent, you can guide your child to [learn online](/learn/beyond) or [at a local workshop or camp](/learn/local), or [help us in other ways](/help).  -->

## Professional Development for Teachers

### Elementary school teachers

To introduce your students to our popular introductory courses, attend one of our high quality local workshops, free of charge.

[<button class="teacher-button">Learn more</button>](/educate/k5/) &nbsp;&nbsp;[<button class="teacher-button">Find a local workshop</button>](/professional-development-workshops)
<br><br>
Can't attend a local workshop? Consider completing our free, self-paced [online workshop.](/educate/professional-development-online)

### Middle and high school teachers

Our [workshops](/educate/professional-development) for teachers in grades 6-12 are only available as part of a [district-wide partnership](/districts).

[<button class="teacher-button">Learn more</button>](/educate/professional-development)
<br><br>
If a district partnership isn't an option for you, you might consider using [Courses 1-4](/educate/k5) with your students. Our free, self-paced [online workshop](/educate/professional-development-online) provides an opportunity for you to get started teaching CS on their own.

## Partnerships for School Districts

### Elementary schools 

[Partner with us](/educate/k5-district-partnership) to bring computer science to your entire school district, free of charge. Or send your teachers to a [nearby workshop](/professional-development-workshops).

[<button class="district-button">Apply</button>](/educate/k5-district-partnership)

### Middle and High schools 

If you're an administrator at a large district, or situated near an [existing Code.org partner](/educate/partner-districts), apply for a district partnership to bring computer science to your entire district.

## Teacher Community and Support
We’re kicking off a new worldwide community to keep teachers up-to-date on what’s new with Code.org, and to help connect our teachers around the globe. There are many ways to get involved in our community. [Review the options](/educate/community) and choose how you’d like to participate.

[<button>Join our Professional Learning Community</button>](/educate/community)

## Inspire students
Use these videos, posters, and how-to resources to inspire students to try computer science. You can also [nominate a student](/sotw) or [teacher](/totm) for a Code.org award.

## The Hour of Code

The first step to introducing children to computer science is the Hour of Code, the largest learning campaign in history. In one hour, students (and teachers) can learn that computer science is fun, easy, and accessible at all ages.

# Philosophy
If you like to geek out on education philosophy, we've published our [curriculum philosophy](/educate/curriculum-philosophy) and [professional development philosophy](/educate/professional-development-philosophy). We use these documents to inspire our own team's work and to help guide our work with our curriculum partners.
