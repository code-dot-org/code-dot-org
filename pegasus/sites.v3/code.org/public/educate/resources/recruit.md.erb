# Encourage students to learn computer science!

### Here are our top five tips for recruiting students into your computer science class.

1. [Reach out to students personally.](#outreach)
1. [Show them how much fun they'll have in your class.](#videos)
1. [Enlist the help of counselors and parents.](#counselors)
1. [Run an Hour of Code.](#hoc)
1. [Decorate with inspiring posters!](#posters)

<a id="outreach"></a>
## 1. Reach out to students personally.

Teachers tell us that the best way to recruit students into their CS classes is by reaching out directly and **telling them you think they'd be good at it**. And, according to <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/google-and-gallups-computer-science-education-research-six-things-know/", target=_"blank">Google's study</a>, students who have been encouraged by a teacher are 2.5 - 3 times more likely to be interested in learning CS. This is especially important when it comes to inspiring young women to try CS.

Have you thought about taking computer science next year? I think you’d be great at it and I’m hoping you’ll sign up.

**[COURSE NAME]** is a collaborative course where you’ll be working together with your classmates to create your own apps, games, and programs. If you’re already into technology, that’s great, but you definitely don’t need any prior background with technology or computers to take this course. Just bring your creativity and interest in learning about how things work!

No matter what you want to do one day — whether it’s art, medicine, or history — computer science will help you make your ideas come to life. Watch this video to learn more about the things we'll do next year: **[[CS Principles](https://youtu.be/jQm0z894CG0) / [CS Discoveries](https://youtu.be/g4qfsH8bc8s)]**

<H3>Host an information session</H3>

Invite students to your classroom during lunch or after school to learn more about taking computer science.

<details style="margin-left: 20px">
	<summary><strong>Click to expand a 15-minute sample agenda you can use to grab their attention.</strong></summary>
	<p>
	<br/>
**2 minutes:** Welcome!

* You’re here to learn about a class where you’ll explore the technology you use every day—and learn the foundations of how to create it!
* You’ll gain skills that will help you in any career goal in the 21st century—business, art, engineering, policy, medicine, etc.
* We have fun in this class. We solve problems, build things that you want to build, and learn how computers are changing the world.

**3 minutes:** Show the CS Discoveries or CS Principles student recruitment video (see videos, above). </br>

**5 minutes:** Ask students to brainstorm apps they wish existed, or have them come up with questions about how something they use everyday actually works. Then, have them share out ideas or questions. Let them know they can start to tackle these problems in this computer science course. </br>

**5 minutes:** Answer questions from students about the course. </br>

Close your session by handing out recruitment flyers for [CS Discoveries](/files/programs/csd-student-flyer.pdf) or [CS Principles](/files/programs/csp-student-flyer.pdf).

If you have more time, run an Hour of Code activity to give students an idea of how fun and engaging this course will be.

## 3. Enlist the help of counselors and parents.

### Let counselors know these are intro courses for *any* student.

Often counselors think students need a strong math background or prior experience playing with technology to be successful in CS courses. And stereotypes about who enjoys CS often lead to counselors not encouraging young women and students from marginalized racial and ethnic groups[*](#urg) to take computer science courses. Help dispel these myths!

**Encourage your counselor to enroll young women and students from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups in your class. Tell them:**

* Students will be successful in this class without a math background or any prior CS experience.
* Students will enjoy your class even if they don't like video games - everyone uses technology!
* Computer science is foundational for ALL careers and this course will support their career goals even if they don't want a career in tech.

Looking for more ways to engage counselors? <a href="https://www.ncwit.org/resources/top-10-ways-engage-school-counselors-allies-effort-increase-student-access-computer", target=_"blank">Check out these resources</a> from NCWIT and consider printing out a stack of our student flyers for counselors to hand out: [CS Discoveries](/files/programs/csd-student-flyer.pdf) | [CS Principles](/files/programs/csp-student-flyer.pdf)

### Let parents know about the opportunity for their student to enroll in your CS class.

Did you know that <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gySkItxiJn_vwb8HIIKNXqen184mRtzDX12cux0ZgZk/pub#h.aqjcgz8ilft", target=_"blank">over 90% of parents want their children to learn CS</a>? Make sure the parents at your school know that your class is available.

### **Elementary School**

* **For parents:** </br>

**[SCHOOL NAME]** is offering new computer science program next fall that will unlock an entirely new future for students. With this program, even the youngest learners will begin to learn the basics of how technology works. They’ll move away from just learning how to *use* technology, and instead start to *create* their own programs with the foundations of computer science. The program will introduce computer sciecne concepts to these youngsters, such as logic, problem-solving, and creativity. **Why is this important for even elementary school students?** Introducing computer science in elementary school allows students to enjoy the possibilities of creating with code before stereotypes set in. But that’s only the beginning of why every student should have the opportunity to learn computer science. [Watch this inspiring video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc) to learn more.

We can bring this to *even more* elementary school students through a local program in partnership with Code.org, a nonprofit dedicated to giving every K-12 student in the US the opportunity to learn computer science. Ask your school or district to have [more elementary school teachers trained](https://code.org/professional-development-workshops) (absolutely free, and no experience necessary)!
