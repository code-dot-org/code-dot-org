# IT requirements for Code.org tutorials

## What you need

We use [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) to embed videos into Code.org and our [online learning platform](https://studio.code.org). For schools with YouTube blocked, we attempt to display a Code.org hosted video player instead.

### Ask your school or district IT department to whitelist these sites:

| Priority | URL |
| -------- | ----------- |
| **Required**   | `https://code.org`<br/>`https://*.code.org` |
| **Optional**    | `https://cdn.optimizely.com`<br/>`https://www.google-analytics.com` |
| **To use YouTube hosted videos**   | `https://s.youtube.com/*`<br/>`https://www.youtube.com/*`<br/>`https://*.googlevideo.com`<br/>`https://*.ytimg.com` |
| **To use Code.org hosted videos**   | **Unblock:**<br/>`https://videos.code.org`<br/>**Block:**<br/>`https://www.youtube.com/favicon.ico` |
| **To use Internet Simulator**   | `https://api.pusherapp.com`<br/>`wss://ws.pusherapp.com` |

### Hardware

- We recommend at least a 15 MBit/sec Internet connection for your school.

### Software

- Tutorials work on [any modern browser](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/202591743).
- If YouTube is blocked at your school and you're using Firefox or Safari, Code.org hosted videos require [Flash player](https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/). Chrome, iOS and Android do not require extra software to play videos.

## Can you play this video?

Before you start Code.org's online courses, test playback for the video below to make sure you're good to go.

<iframe style="margin: 10px;" width="350" height="195" src="https://studio.code.org/videos/embed/artist_intro?width=350&height=195" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This is the player used throughout the curriculum. It will try to show the video through YouTube and, if YouTube is blocked, show the Code.org hosted video instead.

## Video not playing?

If the default (auto-detected) player above is not playing videos properly, here are two other options to make it work:

### Use the fallback video player

If YouTube is blocked at your school, we will default to the Code.org hosted fallback video player. If this does not work, submit your information at the [video test page](https://studio.code.org/videos/test) so we can help diagnose the issue.

### Continue without streaming videos

If you can't get embedded videos to play, you can still use our tutorials without them.

1. We've made all our videos [available for download together](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/aax85b3850olxcx/mso9d17QtH). If your school has low bandwidth, we recommend that you download videos and show them to students on a shared screen.
2. Integrated into our tutorials, we've added a green download link icon <img src="/images/green-download.png" width=25 height=25/> for each video, allowing students to download individual tutorial videos.
3. If all fails, there is a "Show Notes" tab that provides a storyboard equivalent of videos.
