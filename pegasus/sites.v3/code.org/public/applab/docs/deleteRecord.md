[short_description]

Using App Lab's table data storage, deletes the provided `record` in `tableName`. `record` is an object that must be uniquely identified with its id field. When the call is completed, the `callbackFunction` is called. Data is accessible to your app and users of your app.

[/short_description]

**First time using App Lab table data storage?** Read a short overview of what it is and how to use it [here](/applab/docs/tabledatastorage).
**Note:** View your app's table data by clicking 'View data' in App Lab and clicking the table name you want to view.

### Examples
____________________________________________________

[example]

**Create and then delete a record** In this example, a record is created in a table named 'fav_foods' when the 'Create Record' button is clicked. The record is deleted from the table when the 'Delete Record' button is clicked. First try clicking 'Create Record', and then viewing the data in the data browser. Then, click 'Delete Record' and refresh the data in the data browser. What happens if you click 'Delete Record' again?


```
//When 'Create' is clicked, add a new record to the table and write a confirmation to the display
button("createButton", "1. Create record");
onEvent("createButton", "click", function(event) {
  createRecord("fav_foods", {name:'Rosie', age:19, food:"salad"}, function() {
    write("Record created! View data to see the record");
  });
});

//When 'Delete' is clicked, delete the record with id:1 from the table and write to the display
button("deleteButton", "2. Delete record");
onEvent("deleteButton", "click", function(event) {
  deleteRecord("fav_foods", {id:1}, function() {
      write("Record deleted! Refresh the data to see that the record doesn't exist");
  });
});


```

[/example]

[example]

**Search for matching records and delete them** In this more detailed example, we set up two text input boxes each with submit buttons.
The first lets you add your favorite foods to the table `food_survey`. Add multiple items, including some duplicates, and use the
data browser to view your data. Then, using the second text input, you can search for foods to delete. `readRecords` is used to
search for records matching the search query, and finally `deleteRecord` is called on each record that is returned in the records
results array.


```
/*
When the submit button is clicked, get the food from the text input and store it as a record
*/
textLabel("foodLabel", "What's your favorite food?", "foodInput");
textInput("foodInput", "");
button("submit", "Submit");
onEvent("submit", "click", function() {
  var response = getText("foodInput");
  createRecord("food_survey", {food:response}, function() {
    write("Record created! View data to see the record");
  });
});

/*
When the delete button is clicked, call the deleteItems helper function (defined below)
*/
textLabel("deleteLabel", "What food do you want to delete?", "deleteInput");
textInput("deleteInput", "");
button("delete", "Delete");
onEvent("delete", "click", function() {
  deleteItems();
});

/*
Define a function that gets the text from the deleteInput text input, and uses that as the
`searchTerm` in readRecords to find all matching records. For each record in the array that
is returned, get the id and delete it
*/
function deleteItems() {
  var deleteQuery = getText("deleteInput");
  readRecords("food_survey", {food:deleteQuery}, function(records) {
    for (var i =0; i < records.length; i++) {
      deleteRecord("food_survey", {id:records[i].id}, function() {
        write("Record deleted! Refresh the data to see that the record doesn't exist");
      });
    }
  });
}

```

[syntax]

### Syntax

```
deleteRecord(tableName, recordId, function(){
    //callback function code goes here
  });
```

[/syntax]

[parameters]

### Parameters

| Name  | Type | Required? | Description |
|-----------------|------|-----------|-------------|
| tableName | string | Yes | The name of the table from which the records should be searched and read. |
| record | object | Yes | To identify the record to be deleted, the record needs to be provided in the record object format. Only the id field is mandatory to uniquely identify the record. Examples: {id:recordId}, {id:1}, {id:records[0].id}
| callbackFunction | function | Yes | A function that is asynchronously called when the call to deleteRecord() is finished.|

[/parameters]

[returns]

### Returns
No return value. When `deleteRecord()` is finished executing, `callbackFunction` is automatically called.

[/returns]

[tips]

### Tips
- This function has a callback because it is accessing the remote data storage service and therefore will not finish immediately.
- Use with [createRecord()](/applab/docs/createRecord), [readRecords()](/applab/docs/readRecords), and [updateRecord()](/applab/docs/updateRecord) records to create, read, and update records in a table.
