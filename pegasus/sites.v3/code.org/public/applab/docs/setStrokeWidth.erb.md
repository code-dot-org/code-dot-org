[description]

[short_description]

Sets the line width for the active canvas.

[/short_description]

The stroke width controls, for the active canvas, the thickness of lines drawn with [line()](/applab/docs/line), [rect()](/applab/docs/rect), and [circle()](/applab/docs/circle). The stroke width controls the thickness of lines drawn with  The width is measured in pixels. As the stroke width increases, the lines drawn get thicker equally on both sides. Any lines or shapes that have already been drawn are not affected.

### Examples
____________________________________________________

[example]

```
// Draw two parallel lines that start and end at the same x coordinates, but have different stroke widths. Because the lines have rounded ends, the thicker line is in fact longer than the thinner line.
createCanvas("canvas1");
line(120, 50, 200, 50);
setStrokeWidth(20);
line(120, 75, 200, 75);
```

[/example]

____________________________________________________

[example]

**Example: Down the Middle** Draw two lines with the same start and end point, but with different stroke widths. Thicker strokes expand the line equally on both sides.

```
// Draw two lines with the same start and end point, but with different stroke widths. Thicker strokes expand the line equally on both sides.
createCanvas("canvas1");
setStrokeColor("lightblue");
setStrokeWidth(20);
line(0, 50, 320, 50);
setStrokeColor("black");
setStrokeWidth(1);
line(0, 50, 320, 50);
```

[tips]

### Tips
- *setStrokeWidth* only affects the active canvas. If there is more than one canvas, each one can have a different stroke width.
- When a new canvas is created, its stroke width will be the default value of 1 pixel.
- A canvas element must be created before the stroke width can be changed. Create a canvas element in Design mode first, or call [createCanvas()](/applab/docs/createCanvas) before calling *setStrokeWidth()*.
