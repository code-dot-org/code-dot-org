[/short_description]

Today's apps are not limited to text input boxes, text labels, buttons and dropdown menus, but are visual. You can add images to your apps, and even make them dynamic, responding to user interaction. An event handler must be created for each type of user interaction with an image using [onEvent()](/applab/docs/onEvent) and the *id*. There are two ways to fill in the url string for the second parameter.

**1. Copy the URL of an image on the web.**
In most browsers you can simply *right-click (ctrl+click on a Mac)* on an image and you'll see a menu with a few option. One will be to copy the URL of the image. You could also choose to view the image in its own window and just copy the URL from there.

**2. Upload your own image to App Lab.**
You can upload images saved on your computer to your app in App Lab.

- Click the pulldown arrow in the image URL field and then click "Choose..."![](https://images.code.org/e726e56fd3e4c7cd4a0d58cba731a855-image-1444240440116.53.49%20PM.png)
- Then click the "Upload File" button the in the window.

- Then choose the file from your computer by navigating to it
- Once its uploaded click "Choose" next to it.  This will insert the name of the file into the URL field.  Because you have uploaded it, it doesn't need to be an HTTP reference.
