## move(x, y)

[/name]

[category]

Category: Turtle

[/category]

[description]

[short_description]

Moves the turtle by adding x pixels to the turtle's current x position and y pixels to the turtle's current y position. 

[/short_description]

Some drawings are more easily described by movements of the turtle *relative* to the current turtle location. Unlike moveForward(pixels), the turtle can move in a direction different from its facing direction.

[/description]

### Examples
____________________________________________________

[example]

```
// Draw a line while moving the turtle to the right and down.
move(50, 50);
```

[/example]

____________________________________________________

[example]

**Example: Turtle Direction Irrelevant** Draw the same line as the previous example but with the turtle facing a different direction.

```
// Draw the same line as the previous example but with the turtle facing a different direction.
turnRight(90);
move(50, 50);
```

[/example]

____________________________________________________

[example]

**Example: Arrow** Draw a arrow pointing up from a random location on the screen.

<table>
<tr>
<td style="border-style:none; width:90%; padding:0px">
<pre>
// Draw a arrow pointing up from a random location on the screen.
penUp();
moveTo(randomNumber(320),randomNumber(480));
penDown();
move(0, -100);
move(-25, 50);
move(50, 0);
move(-25, -50);
</pre>
</td>
<td style="border-style:none; width:10%; padding:0px">

[tips]

### Tips
- Use [penUp()](/applab/docs/penUp) before calling move(x,y) to have the turtle not draw as it moves.
- The screen default size is 320 pixels wide and 450 pixels high, but you can move the turtle off the screen by exceeding those dimensions.
- There are three ways to move the turtle in a straight line:
	- Specify the number of pixels to move the turtle in the direction it is facing using [moveForward(pixels)](/applab/docs/moveForward) or [moveBackward(pixels)](/applab/docs/moveBackward).
	- Specify a number of pixels in the x and y direction to move the turtle using move(x,y), regardless of direction that the turtle is facing.
	- Specify an x and y pixel location on the screen to move the turtle to using [moveTo(x,y)](/applab/docs/moveTo), regardless of direction that the turtle is facing.
