[short_description]

Displays the string or variable in the console display

[/short_description]

console.log() is used to help you understand what your code is doing.  By displaying a message containing either descriptive text that tells you what is happening or the value of particular variables, you can follow along as your code executes.

### Examples

[example]


```
console.log("It's Alive!") // Let's you know your code is running
```

[/example]

[example]


```
// I'm thinking of a number between 0 and 10
var myRandomNumber = randomNumber(10)
console.log("My random number is: " + myRandomNumber)
```

[/example]

____________________________________________________
[example]


```
// Display the true/false state of a checkbox
checkbox("myCheckbox", false);
textLabel("myLabel", "Click on or off", "myCheckbox");
onEvent("myCheckbox", "click", function(event) {
  console.log("Checkbox is: " + getChecked("myCheckbox"));
});
```

[tips]

### Tips
- Code that has a lot of console.log() messages is considered "chatty" because it talks to you a lot.  Chatty code is good when you first write a new block of code because it helps you know what is happening, so don't hesitate to use console.log() a lot.  But chatty code can be irritating after a while, so once your code is working the way you want, it is a good idea to go back through and clean up by removing console.log() messages that are no longer helpful.
- Remember that the + operator works differently for numbers than strings.  For instance console.log(5 + 3) will display "8" because the integers 5 and 3 will be added together then automatically converted to a string, but console.log("5" + "3") will simply concatenate the two strings to display "53".
