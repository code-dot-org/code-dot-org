## penUp()

[/name]


[category]

Category: Turtle

[/category]

[description]

[short_description]

Stops the turtle from drawing a trail behind it as it moves.

[/short_description]

**Note**: [penDown()](/applab/docs/penDown) is often used with penUp.
**Note**: If you are not seeing the turtle's movement, slow the program execution down by adjusting the slider bar under the blue reset button.

### Examples
____________________________________________________

[example]

**Example 1**


```
speed(20);          // sets the speed to 20, so its easier to see the turtle's movement
penUp();            // stops the turtle from drawing a trail behind it as it moves
moveForward(100);   // moves the turtle forward 100 pixels
```

[/example]

**Example 2**

This example uses penUp and penDown to draw a dotted line.


```
speed(20);                    // sets the speed to 20, so its easier to see the turtle's movement
penWidth(3);                  // sets the pen's thickness to 3 pixels
penUp();                      // lifts the pen up so the turtle does not leave a trail behind it as it moves
move(-125, 25);               // moves the turtle to its starting location
turnRight(90);                // turns the turtle 90 degrees so that it is facing to the right
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) { // repeats the code in this block 5 times
  penDown();                  // puts the pen down so the turtle leaves a trail behind it as it moves
  moveForward(25);            // moves the turtle froward 25 pixels
  penUp();                    // lifts the pen up so the turtle does not leave a trail behind it as it moves
  moveForward(25);            // moves the turtle forward 25 pixels
}

```

**Example 3**

This example uses penUp and penDown to draw a pair of eyes.


```
speed(20);          // sets the speed to 20, so its easier to see the turtle's movement
hide();             // hides the turtle so it is no longer visible
penDown();          // puts the pen down so the turtle leaves a trail behind it as it moves
arcRight(360, 25);  // draws a circle with a 25 pixel diameter (first eye)
penUp();            // lifts the pen up so the turtle does not leave a trail behind it as it moves
move(25, 10);       // moves the turtle inside the circle (first eye)
dot(10);            // draws a 10 pixel dot (first pupil)
move(-100, -10);    // moves the turtle into position for the second eye
penDown();          // puts the pen back down so the turtle leaves a trail behind it as it moves
arcRight(360, 25);  // draws the second eye, a circle with a 25 pixel diameter (second eye)
penUp();            // lifts the pen up so the turtle does not leave a trail behind it as it moves
move(25, 10);       // moves the turtle inside the circle (second eye)
dot(10);            // draws a 10 pixel dot (second pupil)
```
