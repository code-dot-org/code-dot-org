## clearCanvas()

Category: Canvas

[/category]

[description]

[short_description]

Clear all data on the active canvas.

[/short_description]

Clearing a canvas is typically done after some event, so that whatever was drawn has a chance to be seen before it is erased. Examples below will make use of [`setTimeout()`](/applab/docs/setTimeout) and [`onEvent()`](/applab/docs/onEvent) to more clearly demonstrate `clearCanvas`.

**Note**: When a canvas element is created, it will have no data to clear. Create a canvas element in Design mode, or call [`createCanvas()`](/applab/docs/createCanvas).

### Examples
____________________________________________________

[example]

This example draws a square and then erases it, leaving the screen empty. The drawing is erased so fast that it cannot be seen.


```
// Create a canvas and draw a square in its center
createCanvas();
setStrokeWidth(10);
rect(120, 200, 80, 80);
// Clear the canvas right away
clearCanvas();
```

[/example]

____________________________________________________

[example]

This example draws a square, then uses [`setTimeout()`](/applab/docs/setTimeout) to wait 3000 milliseconds (3 seconds) before clearing the canvas.


```
// Create a canvas and draw a square in its center
createCanvas();
setStrokeWidth(10);
rect(120, 200, 80, 80);
// Clear the canvas after 3 seconds
setTimeout(function() {
    clearCanvas();
}, 3000);
```

[/example]

____________________________________________________

[example]

This example uses [`onEvent()`](/applab/docs/onEvent) to draw a circle wherever the canvas is clicked. Each time the canvas is clicked, the canvas is cleared and a new circle is drawn. This ensures that only one circle is visible at a time.


```
textLabel("instruction", "Click on the screen below this text...");
createCanvas("canvas");
onEvent("canvas", "click", function(click) {
  clearCanvas(); // Erase anything that was drawn before the click
  circle(click.offsetX, click.offsetY, 20); // Draw a circle where the click occurred
});
```
