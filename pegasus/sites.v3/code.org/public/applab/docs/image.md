[short_description]

Displays the image from the provided URL on the screen.

### How to find the URL of an image on the web
To use an image in an app in App Lab the image must already exist somewhere on the web with a unique web address (or URL).  This gives you two options:

#### 1. Use an image that already exists on the web
In most browsers you can simply **right-click (ctrl+click on a Mac)** on the image and there will be several options for you to copy the URL or even view it in a new window from which you can copy the URL.  So you might search for an image with Google image search, or Bing images.  Any image you find there, you can use this technique with.

#### 2. Upload an image to a site that will give it an address
You can upload images to websites or even image hosting services such as tumblr, imgur, or img42.  If you have a personal photo or image that you would like to use, upload it to one of those sites and get the URL from there.

**Example 2**

Click the button to change the character image on the screen from the dog to the bee and back again.


```
// use variables to store the ids for the image and button elements
var imageId = "character";
var buttonId = "changeButton";

// use variables store the urls for the dog and bee character images
var dogImageURL = "http://studio.code.org/blockly/media/skins/applab/static_avatar.png";
var beeImageURL = "http://studio.code.org/blockly/media/skins/bee/static_avatar.png";

// create an image element with the dog character
image(imageId, dogImageURL);

// create a button element
button(buttonId, "Change Character");

// add a click event to the button to change the character
onEvent(buttonId, "click", function(event) {

  // get the current character image URL
  var currentCharacterURL = getImageURL(imageId);

  // determine which character is currently displayed on the screen
  // check if the current character URL is the same URL as the dog character's
  if (currentCharacterURL == dogImageURL) {
    // current character displayed on screen is the dog
    // change the character to the bee
    setImageURL(imageId, beeImageURL);
  } else {
    // the current character url is not the dog character's url
    // the current character url is the bee
    // change the character to the dog
    setImageURL(imageId, dogImageURL);
  }
});
