# Data Privacy Addendum

Code.org® is a nonprofit dedicated to expanding participation in computer science by making it available in more schools, and increasing participation by women and students from marginalized racial and ethnic groups underrepresented in computer science. We provide high-quality K-12 [elementary, middle and high school](https://studio.code.org/courses) courses for any student or teacher under a creative commons no cost licence.

We take students’ privacy very seriously. We [are transparent](/privacy) about what data we collect, why we collect it, and what we do with it if we have it. We’ve also [received top marks](https://privacy.commonsense.org/evaluation/code.org) from a Common Sense Media’s review of our [Privacy Policy](/privacy) and practices. And Code.org has signed the [Student Privacy Pledge](https://studentprivacypledge.org/) to demonstrate our commitment to privacy.

We know that districts often seek to enter into Data Privacy Agreements with education providers. If you are a school administrator in a K-12 school in the United States that uses or wishes to use Code.org, then in addition to accepting our [Terms of Service](/tos) and [Privacy Policy](/privacy), you may choose to add this Student Data Privacy Addendum (DPA) to our agreement. This DPA aligns with the provisions of the [National Data Privacy Agreement Template](https://privacy.a4l.org/national-dpa/) developed by the Student Data Privacy Consortium, and has been designed to address compliance with applicable laws and best privacy practices in the industry.

When you click on the "Read and sign our DPA" button above, you will be redirected from Code.org to DocuSign.  After providing your name and email address, you will receive an email from DocuSign allowing you to sign and receive a copy of the fully executed DPA for your records.

Although our standard DPA is designed to address the requirements of most states, we have created specific state versions of the DPA for [New York](/dpa-ny), [Illinois](/dpa-il) and [Montana](/dpa-mt).  Click on the links to be redirected to a page containing the state-specific DPA.
