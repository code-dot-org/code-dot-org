<strong>Recommended for grades K-5</strong>
<p>Hear from three NASA scientists about their career journeys and how they use art and data science to build 3D models of the universe.</p>
<p><b>About the speakers</b>:
<br>
<strong>Kim Arcand</strong> was working in molecular biology and public health when she was hired for NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory in 1998. Since she always wanted to be an astronaut when she was little, this opportunity got Kim close to the cosmos but without the long distance commute. Today, Kim uses data to tell stories about science, whether in the form of a 3D print of an exploded star, a book about light, or a Virtual Reality application for high-energy astrophysics. For more background, please check out Kim’s <a href="https://www.kimarcand.com/" target="_blank">personal page</a>.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Sasha Samochina</strong> (sam-ocean-uh) is an award-winning creative technologist, who leads the Data Visualization and Infusion team at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. With a background in art, Sasha creates software that incorporates innovative forms of visualization that aid scientists, engineers, and astronauts. She loves all things digital, animal, sound-emitting, cosmic, and views the world through XR-colored glasses.
