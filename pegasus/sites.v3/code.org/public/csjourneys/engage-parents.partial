<p>Did you know students who hear from parents that they would be good at computer science are <a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/encouraging-students-toward-computer-science-learning-brief.pdf" target="_blank">2-3 times more likely</a> to be interested in learning it? Connect with parents and recruit their help in encouraging students to learn and continue on their computer science journey.</p>
<p>Here’s some template language you can include in your emails and letters home.</p>

<h2>CS Fundamentals Teachers</h2>
<h3 style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:30%"><strong>Suggested beginning-of-year message to send home</strong></h3>
<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:30%">This year in class your student will be learning about computer science! Elementary school is a great time for students to learn the basics and start exploring this essential subject.</p>
<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:30%">Why are we learning computer science? CS teaches students critical thinking and problem solving. In fact, <a href="https://codeorg.medium.com/cs-helps-students-outperform-in-school-college-and-workplace-66dd64a69536" target="_blank">studies show</a> that students who learn computer science perform better in reading, science, and math.</p>
<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:30%">In these lessons, your child will collaborate with others, investigate different problem-solving techniques, and learn to persist in the face of challenging tasks. You can take a look at some of our lessons <a href="https://code.org/educate/curriculum/csf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:30%"><i>[Teachers: optionally, you could share a link to a student project, like a Dance Party Creation or a link to the projects gallery to give parents a glimpse of what your students might be creating]</i></p>
<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:30%">Outside of the class, you might explore <a href="/careers-with-cs/k5" target="_blank">career inspiration and exploration resources</a> to help your child make connections beyond the classroom. Students are more likely to connect with material when given opportunities to see how it's used in the real world. Spark their imagination and help them envision where CS could lead them.</p>
