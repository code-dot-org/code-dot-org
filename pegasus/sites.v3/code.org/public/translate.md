# Help us translate Code.org

We want help translating the Code.org site, tutorials, and videos. 

1. Sign up [here](http://eepurl.com/Im_In) to stay up to date on what we need translated.
2. Join the [Code.org project](https://crowdin.com/project/codeorg/invite), and start immediately!
3. To translate video captions, please see more info below.

## Translating the site and tutorials
The majority of our translations are done through CrowdIn, a localization management platform. It is free to join and any volunteer can immediately contribute to the project by providing translations. The final translation that appears on our site can be chosen in two ways: 

1. volunteers vote on the best translation and the highest scoring translation is chosen 
2. a proofreader can automatically select the best translation

<br>
To apply to be a proofreader, please send an email to translations@code.org with your CrowdIn username and credentials. Translations do not need to be approved to appear on the site. We will accept either the highest voted up translation or, if there's a tie, the most recent. A language needs to be at least 75% translated (and preferably approved as well) to be added to the language drop down menu. 

<br>
There are currently three projects, the [Code.org](https://crowdin.com/project/codeorg), [Hour of Code](https://crowdin.com/project/hour-of-code), and [Lesson Plans](https://crowdin.com/project/lesson-plans). Please complete translations for these projects in that order of priority. If you have completed translations for the Hour of Code or Code.org project and you do not see your language in the drop down menu, please send a report to translations@code.org.

## Translating video captions
Translations for video captions is done through Google Translate Toolkit. To get started, send a request for an invite to translations@code.org, including a gmail email address (or one hosted on Gmail) and the language you'd like to translate. You will be sent invitations for the videos that are still missing translations in your language.

The process for translating video captions is as follows:

1. I send you an invite for a video translation with an English caption track.
2. As you work on the translations, you can click File/Save or wait for it to save automatically every few minutes. 
3. When you're sure the translations are complete, click the "Publish to YouTube" button. This sends me an email telling me you're done.
4. After receiving this email, I will manually publish them. I will then send you a confirmation e-mail that it's been published.
5. Verify that you can see captions in your language and that they appear with your translations.

Note, that when you click "Publish to YouTube" it will give you an error message because you don't have access to do so. This is OK. It will not actually publish it to YouTube, but it will still send me the e-mail notifying me that you're done. Since it sends me an e-mail, you do not need to send me another one telling me that you finished.

## Tips for Translating
The Code.org drag-drop tutorials are based on the Blockly language. Many of the tips below are loosely based on the wiki article [Translating:Blockly](http://translatewiki.net/wiki/Translating:Blockly)

### Be Gender Neutral
The target audience for drag-drop programming is individual or small groups of children, aged 8+. Please use gender-neutral forms if possible in your language.

### Keep Spanish General
There are several languages with multiple dialects, but please keep Spanish and other such languages in a general form that will be universally understandable by all dialects.

### Avoid Technical Jargon
Our tutorials are meant for beginners, so please avoid technical jargon. It is **far** more important that language be clear to beginners than for it to match what experienced programmers might use. For example, Blockly uses the term "text" instead of "string", and we use "list" instead of "array". Also, Blockly uses 1-based indexing instead of the more common 0-based indexing.

### Review The CrowdIn Glossary
Consistency is important. In English, for example, we have gone back and forth on whether to use the term "function" or "procedure". What is more important than which term is chosen is that the same term is used throughout. Inside the CrowdIn interface, click the "Terminology" tab to see what the key terms are. These are the ones that need to be translated consistently within each language.

### Untranslatable Symbols
If any mathematical (or other) symbols are inappropriate in your language but are not offered for customization, please let us know by contacting translations@code.org.

### Translate Text, Not Code
Code that shows up in peach or green like `var x = 2;`, `&quot;`, `%{keyword}` should not be translated. There is also the case when you might see text such as `{ outside text { inside text } outside text }`. Notice the two sets of curly braces. Translate the inside text, but do not translate the outside text. And for consistency, leep the same capitalization and punctuation of our strings.

### Use Informal Style
The tone is informal and conversational, and we prefer short phrases to long ones, such as "if path ahead" instead of "if there is a path ahead". Translations do not need to be exact.

### CrowdIn Etiquette
As a translator, please do not submit a translation that is identical to another user's submission. If you think a proofreader has made a mistake, please leave a comment in the comment section to bring it to their attention. As a proofreader, please do not delete translations.


## Be a Lead Translator
If you'd like to be a lead translator, please e-mail translations@code.org with your name, language, and credentials. A lead translator will be the first point of contact when we need something translated immediately. We will ask that you translate regularly, as we update the site constantly. The commitment is about 5-10 hours per week. As a thank you for your dedication, we feature [Lead Translators](/translators).
