# Terms of Service

Date of Last Revision: March 9, 2021

Code.org is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization (“Code.org”). Our mission is to give every student the opportunity to learn computer science. As a part of that mission, Code.org operates the websites located at [https://code.org](https://code.org/), [https://studio.code.org](https://studio.code.org/),  [https://www.k12cs.org](https://www.k12cs.org/), [https://hourofcode.com](https://hourofcode.com/), [https://curriculum.code.org](https://curriculum.code.org/), [https://advocacy.code.org](https://advocacy.code.org/), other websites, information, text, curricula, videos, graphics, photos, APIs, email notifications and other materials and related products and services (the “**Services**”).

Please read these Terms of Service (“**Terms**”) carefully before accessing or using the Services. Accessing or using any part of the Services or clicking on an “I Agree” or “Sign Up” button that may be made available to you means that you agree to be bound by these Terms without modification.

These Terms are a legal contract between you (the “User”) and Code.org regarding your use of the Services. In the event these Terms are translated into another language resulting in any potential conflict or ambiguity, the official version of the Terms shall remain the English version. You may use the Services only if you can form a binding contract with Code.org and are not a person barred from receiving the Services under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdiction. If you are accepting these Terms and using the Services on behalf of a company, organization, school, government, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to do so. You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations. Note: If you are a teacher creating an account on behalf of your students, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service on behalf of the educational organization you work for, and are authorized to do so.

These Terms are subject to change. You are agreeing to be bound by such changes if you continue to use the Services after these Terms change, so please check these Terms for changes periodically.


### Additional Terms

Some Services may be subject to additional posted guidelines, rules or terms of service (“**Additional Terms**”) and your use of such Services will be conditioned on your agreement to the Additional Terms. If there is any conflict between these Terms and the Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will control for that Service, unless the Additional Terms expressly state that these Terms will control.

### Children Under Age 13
We take steps to minimize the collection of personal data from Users under the age of 13 as explained in the Code.org [privacy policy](/privacy). Users under the age of 13 will be able to use our App Lab, Game Lab, and Web Lab tools in the classroom with their teacher’s approval. Users under the age of 13 will not be permitted to use these tools for outside the classroom use. Users under 13 can try most tutorials and courses without creating an account, but their learning progress won’t be saved. Users under the age of 13 are required to to get the approval of a parent or legal guardian before creating an account on Code.org. Code.org allows certain representatives of school districts and schools, such as teachers, administrators, counselors, and other educators (an “**Educator**”) to connect with their students through the Services in order to provide tutorial, educational and similar services. If you are an Educator, you may register accounts on the Services for one or more of your students.


If you are an Educator and you register an account for a student who is under the age of 13 (a “**Child**”), you represent and warrant that you or the educational organization you work for has proper permission to register the Child for Code.org, and that you have obtained the necessary parental consent for Code.org’s collection of  the Child’s personal data for the use and benefit of the school and for no other commercial purpose. In addition, you agree to be bound by these Terms on behalf of the educational organization you work for.




### Your Account

If you create an account for Services, you are responsible for the security of your account and for keeping your own password safe. If you are using an account assigned to you by an Educator, your Educator may be able to access and disable your account.

Code.org may permit you to register an account for the Services through certain third party social networking services, such as Facebook Connect and Google (“**Authentication Service**”). By registering for the Services using an Authentication Service, you agree that Code.org may access your account information from the Authentication Service and you agree to any and all terms of use of the Authentication Service regarding your use of the Services via the Authentication Service. You are solely responsible for your interactions with the Authentication Service.

### Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. Code.org’s [Privacy Policy](/privacy) explains how we treat and protect your personal data and is incorporated into these Terms by reference. Please read the Privacy Policy carefully for information relating to Code.org’s collection, use, and disclosure of your personal data as well as the administrative, technical and physical safeguards we maintain to protect against unauthorized use, disclosure of or access to personal data.

In addition, if you are a student or teacher using Code.org in a primary or secondary school with whom we have entered into a separate agreement that supplements these Terms, such as our [Student Data Privacy Addendum](/dpa), the terms of those separate agreements may also apply.

If you are a student that uses an account registered for you by an Educator or otherwise connected to an Educator, you agree that Code.org may disclose your information to the Educators associated with your account. If you are an Educator, you agree not to share Student Records (as defined in our Privacy Policy) you receive from Code.org with anybody other than authorized agents of the classroom, school district, or other educational establishment you represent. Code.org does not use Student Records for any targeted or behavioral advertising, profiling, or onward disclosure.

### The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”)
We help schools be compliant with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) by facilitating a school’s access to student data in response to a request from a parent. Email us at support@code.org for assistance.

### User Generated Content - Management; License Grant; Representations and Warranties

The Services enable Users and Schools (as defined in our Privacy Policy) to provide, share or post certain content or information, including, but not limited to, computer code (including both source and object code), audio recordings, photographs, videos, documents, online educational resources, or other materials, and Feedback, (as defined below) (collectively, “User Content”). You should not include any Student’s Personal Information (which are defined in our Privacy Policy) or Student educational records, in any of the User Content you create. If you or a Student in your class accidentally includes any Student’s Personal Information, please contact us at support@code.org. User Content may be used by Code.org in connection with the Services and may be visible to or shared with Code.org, other Schools, and certain other Users. Please visit our [Privacy Policy](/privacy) for additional information on the types of information different Users are able to provide.
 
Teachers may contribute educational content, create answers to assessments, create derivative works (e.g., completion of assignments, projects, etc.), and transmit said data and content within the  School’s systems through the Services (collectively, “Teacher Content”).

Schools and Users may submit feedback, comments or suggestions for improvements to the Services (in written, oral, or any other form) (“Feedback”).

### Ownership

By submitting or distributing User Content through the Services or directly to Code.org staff, you hereby grant to Code.org a worldwide, non-exclusive, transferable, assignable, fully paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable right and license to host, transfer, display, perform, reproduce, modify, distribute and redistribute, adapt, prepare derivative works of, use, make, have made, import, and otherwise exploit your User Content (which should not contain any Student’s Personal Information), under all intellectual property rights therein, in whole or in part, in any media formats and through any media channels (now known or hereafter developed).

In addition, by submitting or distributing User Content through the Services, you hereby grant to each user of the Services a non-exclusive license to access and use your User Content.

### License to User Content

##### User Content

You hereby grant to Code.org a limited, non-exclusive, sublicensable (as necessary to provide the Services, including distributing Teacher Content), worldwide, royalty-free, and transferable (only to a successor) right and license to:

1. use, host, copy, store, distribute, publicly perform and display, publish (in whole or in part), modify, and create derivative works from (such as changes we make so that your content works better with our Service) User Content as necessary to provide, improve and make the Services available to you and other Users, including through any future media in which the Services may be distributed;
2. use, modify, prepare derivative works, publish, distribute and sublicense Feedback without any compensation to you;
3. use and disclose metrics and analytics regarding the User Content in an aggregate or other non-personally identifiable manner (including, for use in improving our Service or in marketing and business development purposes);
4. use any de-identified User Content for any lawful purpose (such as product development, research or other purposes) subject, if applicable, to the [Data Privacy Addendum](/dpa) or similar agreement; and
5. use for other purposes permitted by the Code.org [Privacy Policy](/privacy) and, if applicable, the [Data Privacy Addendum](/dpa) or similar agreement.

Code.org  will only share and use your personal data in accordance with Code.org's current Privacy Policy.  When you upload or create User Content, this can be viewed by your Teacher and (under your control) by other Users and this means that you are allowing others to access and use that information and to associate it with you.

By uploading, creating, submitting or distributing User Content through the Services, you hereby grant other Users a non-exclusive, transferable (only to a successor), royalty-free right and license to use, reproduce, create derivative works, publicly display and perform any of your User Content that is incorporated into that User's project, provided that Code.org shall not use or distribute your User Content on a stand alone basis if Code.org’s license grant has been terminated as set forth below. The foregoing license and restrictions does not limit Code.org rights under any third party or open source license in which your User Content may be licensed.

##### Public Content

In addition to the rights, licenses and privileges referred to above, you agree that Code.org may use and refer to your User Content, first name and screenname that are posted publicly on the Code.org Website and not in private areas of our Service (“Public Content”) (including screenshots) in marketing materials, press releases, financial reports, presentations, website materials, customer lists and other media now known or hereafter discovered in connection with the marketing, advertising and promotion of the  Service, and any products, goods, features, capabilities and/or services associated with the Service. This right will continue until your Public Content is deleted; provided however, that any Public Content previously printed in brochures, articles or other marketing materials that Code.org had prepared before any request for deletion was received will continue to be used.

##### License Termination

The User Content license above will terminate when you or your School (i) delete any User Content containing intellectual property rights (like images or videos) or personally identifiable information (such as that in Student Data); or (ii) delete your account, unless your User Content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it. Such termination may not apply to User Content or Teacher Content, including Student Data or in messages sent through Code.org, that may be deemed an “education record” under the Family Education Rights Act (FERPA) or various other student privacy laws, and which a school controls (“Education Record(s)”). We will delete any Education Record upon receiving a valid request for deletion from your school. Please see our FAQ for more information. Additionally, such termination will not affect the license rights granted to other Users to use your User Content if they previously copied your User Content and they have not deleted it. When you or your School delete User Content it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle or trash bin on a computer. However, you understand that any removed User Content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time following deletion (but will not be available to others). Additionally, you understand and agree that User Content may continue to appear on Code.org, even after you have terminated your account or these Terms of Service, as portions of your User Content may have been copied by other users and/or incorporated into their coding projects.

### User Content Representations and Warranties

You are solely responsible for User Content you post to the Services and the consequences of posting or publishing them. By uploading, submitting, creating, or publishing your User Content to or through the Services, you represent, and warrant that: (1) you are the creator and owner of your User Content and that you have the authority to use or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to publish the User Content you submit; (2) your User Content does not and will not: (a) infringe, violate, or misappropriate any third-party right, including any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of publicity, or any other intellectual property or proprietary right or (b) slander, defame, libel, or invade the right of privacy, publicity or other property rights of any other person; and (3) your User Content does not contain any viruses, adware, spyware, worms, or other malicious code.

### Restrictions on Content and Use of the Services

We reserve the right at all times (but will not have an obligation) to remove or refuse to distribute any User Content on the Website and to suspend or terminate users, without liability to you. We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce the Terms, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect the rights, property or safety of Code.org, its users and the public.

Code.org has no obligation to monitor User Content or other materials. You are responsible for evaluating all User Content including for accuracy, completeness and reliability, and you bear all risk of using such User Content. Code.org will not be responsible for any damages that you may incur as a result of the submission or use of any User Content.

Code.org may, but is not obligated to, monitor or review any Services where Educators communicate solely with each other, including but not limited to chat rooms, live chats, bulletin boards or other user forums, and the content of any such communications. You assume the risk of such communications, and Code.org has no liability related to the content or use of any such communications.

Users may include links to third party websites in User Content as long as the content of such websites does not violate these Terms. Clicking on such links is at your sole risk. Code.org is not responsible for the availability or the content of linked websites, including the advertising, products or other materials thereon.

The content, information, data, designs, code, and materials associated with the Services (“**Content**”) are protected by intellectual property and other laws. You must comply with all such laws and applicable copyright, trademark or other legal notices or restrictions. Nothing in the Terms gives you a right to use the Code.org name or any of the Code.org trademarks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features. Any feedback, comments, or suggestions you may provide regarding Code.org, or the Services is entirely voluntary and we will be free to use such feedback, comments or suggestions as we see fit and without any obligation to you.

### Code.org Store and Support Forums

The Code.org store and Code.org support forums are operated by third parties. Please read the User Agreement and Privacy Policy for these sites separately before purchasing an item from the Code.org store or before posting a question or answer to the support forum. By accessing the Code.org store and support forums, you agree to be bound by the respective user agreement and privacy policy of these third parties.

### Teacher forum
Our teacher forum, located at [https://forum.code.org](https://forum.code.org), is operated by a third party.

It allows teachers to share resources, ask questions, and get responses from Code.org staff or other members of the community. Teachers may not use the forum to promote external paid resources. Code.org reserves the right to monitor and take down any inappropriate content posted on the forum.

### Volunteer mentors

Code.org encourages software engineers to volunteer as mentors in the classroom to assist teachers in computer science education.

Code.org’s platform does not connect students directly to volunteers or mentors. Instead, Code.org provides Educators information about potential volunteers without any warranty, references, or background checks. If you are an Educator who chooses to ask for the assistance of a volunteer sourced via Code.org’s database, it is entirely your responsibility to thoroughly check references or perform the necessary background checks. Code.org provides no warranty or information other than the ability to contact a potential volunteer, and all liability in any use of volunteers rests only with you. Code.org does not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information provided by volunteers and we neither adopt nor endorse, nor are we responsible for, the accuracy or reliability of any opinion, advice, or statement made by any party other than Code.org. Under no circumstances is Code.org responsible for any loss or damage resulting from any person's reliance on information or other content posted on the Service or transmitted by others.

### Pledges, Donations and Payments

A. Pledges and Donations. If you make a pledge or donation on this website, You agree to pay all pledges and donations specified.

B. Payment Methods. Code.org will charge the pledge or donation you authorized, if any, to the credit or debit card you designate. You authorize the credit or debit card you designate to pay any amounts described herein and authorize Code.org, or any other company that acts as a billing agent for Code.org, to continue to attempt to charge all sums described herein to your credit or debit card account until such pledge or donation are paid in full.

C. Credit Card Authorization. If you use a credit card to pay for any pledge or donation related to the Website, you will be asked to provide Code.org with a credit card number from a card issuer that we accept. Code.org may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account to verify the credit card is valid and/or has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your pledge or donation. These pre-authorizations will reduce your available balance by the authorization amount until it is released or reconciled with the actual charge. Please contact your credit card issuer if you have additional questions regarding when an authorization amount will be removed from your statement.

### Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability

Please read this section carefully since it limits the liability of Code.org and its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, related companies, officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, partners, and licensors (collectively, the “Code.org Entities”). Each of the subsections below only applies up to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties or the limitation of liability in contracts, and as a result the contents of this section may not apply to you. Nothing in this section is intended to limit any rights you may have which may not be lawfully limited.

#### A. The Services are Available “AS-IS”

Your access to and use of the Services or any Content are at your own risk. You understand and agree that the Services are provided to you on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis.

You may provide links to the code.org site, provided (a) that you do not remove or obscure, by framing or otherwise, the copyright, trademark service mark notices or other notices on the site, (b) your site does not engage in illegal or pornographic activities, and (c) you discontinue providing links to the site immediately upon request by us.

#### C. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE CODE.ORG ENTITIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOOD-WILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (i) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; (ii) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; (iii) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE SERVICES; OR (iv) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE CODE.ORG ENTITIES EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00) OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID CODE.ORG, IF ANY, IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM. THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SUBSECTION SHALL APPLY TO ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, STATUTE, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE CODE.ORG ENTITIES HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

SOME STATES OR OTHER JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

### General Terms

#### A. Waiver and Severability

The failure of Code.org to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.

#### B. Controlling Law and Jurisdiction

These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of Washington without regard to or application of its conflict of law provisions or those of your state or country of residence. All claims, legal proceedings or litigation arising in connection with the Services will be brought solely in the federal or state courts located in King County, Washington, United States, and you consent to the jurisdiction of and venue in such courts and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum.

If you are a federal, state, or local government entity in the United States using the Services in your official capacity and legally unable to accept the controlling law, jurisdiction or venue clauses above, then those clauses do not apply to you. For such U.S. federal government entities, these Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the United States of America (without reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of federal law and to the extent permitted under federal law, the laws of the State of Washington (excluding choice of law).

#### C. Entire Agreement

These Terms are the entire and exclusive agreement between Code.org and you regarding the Services (excluding any services for which you have a separate agreement with Code.org that is explicitly in addition or in place of these Terms), and these Terms supersede and replace any prior agreements between Code.org and you regarding the Services. No other person or company will be third party beneficiaries to the Terms.

#### D. Assignment

These Terms and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Code.org without restriction. Any assignment attempted to be made in violation of these Terms shall be null and void.

#### E. Indemnification

You agree, to the extent permissible by law, to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Code.org, its affiliated companies, contractors, employees, agents and its third-party suppliers, licensors, and partners (“Code.org Indemnitees”) from any claims, losses, damages, liabilities, including legal fees and expenses, arising out of any use or misuse of the website, the Services, any violation of the Terms, or any breach of the representations, warranties, and covenants made herein, whether by You or by any Child associated with you if you are a Parent. Code.org reserves the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify Code.org, and you agree to cooperate with Code.org’s defense of these claims. Code.org will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action, or proceeding upon becoming aware of it.

We may revise these Terms from time to time and the most current version will always be at [https://code.org/tos](https://code.org/tos). If the revision, in our sole discretion, is material we will notify you via an e-mail to the email address associated with your account if we have it. By continuing to access or use the Services after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.
