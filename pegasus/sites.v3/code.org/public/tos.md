# Terms of Service
Last Revised: November 29, 2013

Welcome to Code.org, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization (“**Code.org**”).  Our mission is to give every student the opportunity to learn computer science.  As a part of that mission, Code.org operates the web site located at [http://code.org](http://code.org), other websites, information, text, curricula, videos, graphics, photos, APIs, email notifications and other materials and related products and services (the “**Services**”).

Please read these Terms of Service (“**Terms**”) carefully before accessing or using the Services. Accessing or using any part of the Services or clicking on an “I Agree” or “Sign Up” button that may be made available to you means that you agree to be bound by these Terms without modification.  

These Terms are a legal contract between you and Code.org regarding your use of the Services. You may use the Services only if you can form a binding contract with Code.org and are not a person barred from receiving the Services under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdiction. If you are accepting these Terms and using the Services on behalf of a company, organization, government, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to do so. You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations.

These Terms are subject to change.  You are agreeing to be bound by such changes if you continue to use to the Services after these Terms change, so please check these Terms for changes periodically.  

## Additional Terms

Some Services may be subject to additional posted guidelines, rules or terms of service (“**Additional Terms**”) and your use of such Services will be conditioned on your agreement to the Additional Terms. If there is any conflict between these Terms and the Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will control for that Service, unless the Additional Terms expressly state that these Terms will control.

## Minors Under Age 13

If you are under the age of 13 (“**Child**”), you may not use the Services or register an account for the Services without consent and approval from your legal parent or guardian (“**Parent**”). If you begin to register an account by yourself, Code.org may restrict the registration process until a Parent or Representative (as defined below) approves and assumes responsibility for your account. 

If you are a Child, you also may use the Services if you are registered through certain educational organizations (each an “**Authorized School**”) that have entered into a relationship directly with Code.org through a Representative and that have obtained the consent of your Parent for you to use the Services. If you are registered through an Authorized School, you will only be permitted to use the Services for so long as Code.org reasonably believes that your Parent or an Authorized School has consented to such access and use.  
 
If you are at least 18 years of age and you are the Parent of a Child that seeks to register an account for the Services, you must approve and accept responsibility for the account of your Child.  If you register, approve the registration of, or otherwise assume responsibility for any Child as a Parent, you represent and warrant that you are such Child’s legal parent or guardian and you agree to be bound by these Terms on behalf of such Child, including without limitation being liable for all use of the Services by the Child.  

Code.org allows certain representatives of school districts and schools, such as teachers, administrators, counselors, and other educators (a “**Representative**”) to connect with students through the Services in order to provide tutorial, educational and similar services. If you are a Representative, you may register accounts on the Services for one or more of your students.  

If you are a Representative and you register an account for a student who is a Child, you represent and warrant that you or the Authorized School you work for has received express consent from such Child’s Parent for you to register the Child for the Services and for you to disclose certain of the Child’s personal information to Code.org in connection with the registration. In addition, you agree to be bound by these Terms on behalf of such Child, including being liable for the Child’s use of the Services when the liability for such use is not otherwise assumed by a Parent. 

## Your Account

If you create an account for Services, you are responsible for the security of your account and for keeping your own password safe.  If you are using an account assigned to you by a Representative, your Representative may be able to access and disable your account.  

Code.org may permit you to register an account for the Services through certain third party social networking services, such as Facebook Connect and Google (“**Authentication Service**”). By registering for the Services using an Authentication Service, you agree that Code.org may access your account information from the Authentication Service and you agree to any and all terms of use of the Authentication Service regarding your use of the Services via the Authentication Service. You agree that any Authentication Service is a Reference Site (as defined below) and you are solely responsible for your interactions with the Authentication Service as a result of accessing the Services through the Authentication Service.

## Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. Code.org’s [Privacy Policy](/privacy) explains how we treat your personal data and is incorporated into these Terms by reference. Please read the Privacy Policy carefully for information relating to Code.org’s collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information. 

If you are a student that uses an account registered for you by a Representative, you agree that Code.org may disclose your information to the Representatives associated with your account. If you are a Representative, you agree not to share student information you receive from Code.org with anybody other than authorized agents of the classroom, school district, or other educational establishment you represent.

## Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability

Please read this section carefully since it limits the liability of Code.org and its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, related companies, officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, partners, and licensors (collectively, the “Code.org Entities”). Each of the subsections below only applies up to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties or the limitation of liability in contracts, and as a result the contents of this section may not apply to you. Nothing in this section is intended to limit any rights you may have which may not be lawfully limited.

### A. The Services are Available “AS-IS”

Your access to and use of the Services or any Content are at your own risk. You understand and agree that the Services are provided to you on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, THE CODE.ORG ENTITIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.
The Code.org Entities make no warranty and disclaim all responsibility and liability for: (i) the completeness, accuracy, availability, timeliness, security or reliability of the Services or any Content; (ii) any harm to your computer system, loss of data, or other harm that results from your access to or use of the Services or any Content; (iii) the deletion of, or the failure to store or to transmit, any Content and other communications maintained by the Services; and (iv) whether the Services will meet your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis.

You acknowledge and agree that the Code.org Entities are not responsible or liable for: (i) the availability or accuracy of such websites or resources; (ii) the content, products, or services on or available from such websites or resources; or (iii) the protection of the privacy of personal information.

You acknowledge sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from your use of any such websites or resources.

You may provide links to the code.org site, provided (a) that you do not remove or obscure, by framing or otherwise, the copyright, trademark service mark notices or other notices on the site, (b) your site does not engage in illegal or pornographic activities, and (c) you discontinue providing links to the site immediately upon request by us.

### C. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE CODE.ORG ENTITIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOOD-WILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (i) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; (ii) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; (iii) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE SERVICES; OR (iv) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT.
IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE CODE.ORG ENTITIES EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00) OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID CODE.ORG, IF ANY, IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.
THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SUBSECTION SHALL APPLY TO ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, STATUTE, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE CODE.ORG ENTITIES HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

SOME STATES OR OTHER JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.  

## General Terms

### A. Waiver and Severability

The failure of Code.org to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.

### B. Controlling Law and Jurisdiction

These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of Washington without regard to or application of its conflict of law provisions or your state or country of residence. All claims, legal proceedings or litigation arising in connection with the Services will be brought solely in the federal or state courts located in King County, Washington, United States, and you consent to the jurisdiction of and venue in such courts and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum.

If you are a federal, state, or local government entity in the United States using the Services in your official capacity and legally unable to accept the controlling law, jurisdiction or venue clauses above, then those clauses do not apply to you. For such U.S. federal government entities, these Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the United States of America (without reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of federal law and to the extent permitted under federal law, the laws of the State of Washington (excluding choice of law).

### C. Entire Agreement

These Terms are the entire and exclusive agreement between Code.org and you regarding the Services (excluding any services for which you have a separate agreement with Code.org that is explicitly in addition or in place of these Terms), and these Terms supersede and replace any prior agreements between Code.org and you regarding the Services. No other person or company will be third party beneficiaries to the Terms.

### D.  Assignment

These Terms and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Code.org without restriction. Any assignment attempted to be made in violation of these Terms shall be null and void.

### E.  Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Code.org, its affiliated companies, contractors, employees, agents and its third-party suppliers, licensors, and partners (“Code.org Indemnitees”) from any claims, losses, damages, liabilities, including legal fees and expenses, arising out of any use or misuse of the website, the Services, any violation of the Terms, or any breach of the representations, warranties, and covenants made herein, whether by You or by any Child associated with you if you are a Parent. Code.org reserves the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify Code.org, and you agree to cooperate with Code.org’s defense of these claims. Code.org will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action, or proceeding upon becoming aware of it.

We may revise these Terms from time to time, the most current version will always be at code.org/tos. If the revision, in our sole discretion, is material we will notify you via an e-mail to the email associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised 
Terms.
