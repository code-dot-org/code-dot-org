<h1> Native American and Indigenous Peoples Initiative</h1>

<p>Native American communities have unique experiences, barriers, and challenges in offering and fully engaging in computer science (CS) education in their K-12 systems. Data gathered in the <a href="https://code.org/yourschool/about" target=_blank>K-12 Computer Science Access Report</a> shows that Native American students are far less likely to attend a school that offers computer science (59% as opposed to the next lowest access group, Black students at 73%). This is even more significant than it seems since many students attending schools with access are likely attending schools in or near urban centers. Therefore, the disparity is even larger for Native American students attending school within rural and majority native communities. </p>

<br>
<br>
<p>To close these access gaps, Code.org and others across the CS education landscape must: </p>

<ol>
<li> better understand the specific reasons why Native American schools and students do not have access to CS education, and </li>
<li> take strategic and intentional approaches to increase participation by Native American K-12 students and the engagement of their teachers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Code.org is actively learning from students, teachers, and administrators and developing new relationships to learn how to better support Native communities. As we learn more, Code.org will take on specific activities, programs, and partnerships to help make computer science more accessible in indigenous communities.<br>
<br>The gatherings and resources below represent a starting point for our ongoing collaboration with Native American and Indigenous communities.</p>

<h2> CS Teachers in Native Communities Affinity Group</h2>

<p>Monthly, 3rd Tuesdays of the month<p>

<p>Code.org is gathering a teacher affinity group // professional learning community of fellow CS teachers serving mostly Native American students.  These monthly virtual gatherings are a space for teachers to connect with one another, share resources, offer collective problem-solving, and more.  </p>

<p>Please have any interested teachers reach out to naipi@code.org to be added to the calendar invite and sent the zoom link information for the next gathering.</p>


<h2> Indigenous Communities & K-12 CS Education Virtual Summit</h2>
November 4-5, 2021

<p>This summit brought together colleagues, administrators, teachers, policy makers, and advocates to discuss K-12 Computer Science Education in Native American communities.  Video recordings of two sessions will be added below.  More resources discussed at the summit to be shared soon.</p>

<p>This virtual event was held under three banners: <br>
<a href="https://nativesintech.org/" target=_blank>Natives in Tech</a> Annual Conference, <a href="http://Code.org" target=_blank>Code.org</a>, and <a href="https://www.csedcon.com/" target=_blank>CSEdCon</a> (The Global Computer Science Education Conference).</p>
