# CS Fundamentals: Deep Dive

Schools and teachers have asked us to expand our most popular professional learning program. Over 85,000 educators have attended Intro workshops for our <a href="https://code.org/educate/curriculum/elementary-school" target="blank">CS Fundamentals</a> curriculum, rating it 4.8 out of 5 stars, and we want to help you go further.

We know that implementing new computer science courses with fidelity and equity takes time, collaboration, planning and support - which is where Deep Dive workshops come in! Through this workshop, educators will explore course materials, teaching practices, and strategies for continuing to teach CS Fundamentals.

  <summary>**Who should attend?**</summary>
  <p>
  <br/>
  Workshops are open to any elementary school educators who taught some of Code.org’s <a href="https://code.org/educate/curriculum/elementary-school" target="blank">CS Fundamentals</a> courses. Attending a Code.org Intro workshop is not a required prerequisite.

  If you’ve already started teaching CS Fundamentals, we recommend starting with the Deep Dive workshop. If you have not yet begun teaching, we recommend our Intro workshop. See a comparison of our two workshops offerings <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1eiJw35CLX_yxTwmUkAj-4Ps4EvDjdjxh" target="blank"> here</a>. Classroom teachers, librarians, tech teachers, and other educators are all welcome!

  <summary>**How does the workshop transform teacher practice?**</summary>
  <p>
  <br/>
  Developed with Code.org’s <a href="https://code.org/educate/professional-learning/values" target="blank"> professional learning values</a> in mind, the 7-hour Deep Dive workshop provides teachers with a hands-on learning experience with other like-minded teachers. Teachers are given the space to work through the individual challenges in carefully crafted sessions led by experienced facilitators, most of whom were (and often still are) classroom teachers.

  Teachers will leave their Deep Dive workshop not only with an understanding of the details, philosophy, values, and rationale behind how the CS Fundamentals course is structured but also with a *customized plan* for how to implement more of the CS Fundamentals courses. Teachers will have ideas for fostering and developing a strong classroom rapport that nurtures learners of all types and *strategies for addressing roadblocks to implementation*. Ongoing support through the Code.org teacher forum and online support after the workshop will continue to build a *strong community of practice and support* for participating teachers.

  <summary>**How does the workshop support a computer science K-12 pathway?**</summary>
  <p>
  <br/>
  When the six CS Fundamentals’ six courses (A-F)  are implemented successfully in a school, they can become an important part of a district’s K-12 pathway. A potential K-12 pathway using Code.org curricula might have 1) <a href="https://code.org/educate/curriculum/elementary-school" target="blank">CS Fundamentals</a> in elementary school grades, 2) <a href="https://code.org/educate/curriculum/middle-school" target="blank">CS Discoveries</a> offered in middle school grades, and 3) <a href="https://code.org/educate/curriculum/high-school" target="blank">CS Principles </a> offered in the high school grades.

  Deep Dive workshops can be a key strategy to ensure the first part of that pathway, CS Fundamentals, is successfully established. The Intro Workshop is a foundational introduction to the CS Fundamentals curriculum and a great way to support teachers getting started; and the Deep Dive workshop can get them to the finish line. Teachers who complete the Deep Dive workshop will not only leave with a plan for offering more of the CS Fundamentals course, but also connections to a community of support that will help them execute this plan.

  <summary>**How does the workshop support my school’s commitment to equity?**</summary>
  <p>
  <br/>
  Code.org believes that acknowledging and actively addressing the historical inequities within the field of computer science is critical to reaching our goal of bringing computer science to all students. Professional learning plays an essential role in helping educators identify and address equity gaps in their classrooms and schools. Bringing a Deep Dive workshop to your school, or encouraging your teachers to attend a workshop, will support teachers in implementing equitable teaching practices and help ensure computer science is accessible to every student in your schools.
