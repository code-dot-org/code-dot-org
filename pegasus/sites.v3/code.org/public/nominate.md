# Give the Gift of Education: Nominate a Teacher for a Computer Science Scholarship

<img src="/images/teacherandstudents.jpg" class="responsive" width="100%">

<br>

Do you know a teacher who loves learning? [Our workshops](https://code.org/educate/professional-learning) will prepare teachers – even with no prior experience – to teach computer science (CS), to open opportunity for students. Code.org has prepared almost 100,000 educators to teach our courses, and they give our program rave reviews.

“I have learned more about teaching this week than I have in the past 18 years! I will incorporate these methods into all my classes.” *— Robin Whitsel, 10th grade teacher*

<br>

“Honestly, Code.org was one of the best professional development experiences I have ever experienced as a teacher. Besides learning about computer science I also walked away with a new set of teaching skills.” *— Roseanna Misuraca, 6th grade teacher*

The [Code.org course pathway](https://code.org/educate) ranges from kindergarten through high school, so you can nominate any teacher for a scholarship to participate in this wonderful program. Thanks to our generous [donors](https://code.org/about/donors), eligible teachers can receive full scholarships and <strong>all</strong> teachers will learn about free resources to support their students. We welcome teachers from all subject areas – no CS experience needed!

(Note: Scholarship availability varies by region. Outside the US, the teacher prep course is online. All the classroom resources are <strong>completely free of charge</strong>.)
