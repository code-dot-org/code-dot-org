# Nominate a Teacher for a Computer Science Scholarship

<img src="/images/teacherandstudents.jpg" class="responsive" width="100%">

<br>

Do you know a teacher who loves learning? [Our workshops](https://code.org/educate/professional-learning) will prepare teachers – even with no prior experience – to teach computer science (CS), to open opportunity for students. Code.org has prepared almost 100,000 educators to teach our courses, and they give our program rave reviews.

<blockquote style="color:#00adbc">"I have learned more about teaching this week than I have in the past 18 years! I will incorporate these methods into all my classes."</blockquote>
<blockquote style="color:#00adbc">— Robin Whitsel, 10th grade teacher</blockquote>

<br>

The [Code.org course pathway](https://code.org/educate) ranges from kindergarten through high school, so you can nominate any teacher for a scholarship to participate in this wonderful program. Thanks to our generous [donors](https://code.org/about/donors), eligible teachers can receive full scholarships and <strong>all</strong> teachers will learn about free resources to support their students. We welcome teachers from all subject areas – no CS experience needed!

(Note: Scholarship availability varies by region. Outside the US, the teacher prep course is online. All the classroom resources are <strong>completely free of charge</strong>.)
