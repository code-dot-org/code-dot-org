# CS Leaders Prize - Terms and Conditions

This educational campaign is meant to celebrate and promote computer science education. The CS Leaders Prize is managed solely by Code.org, a USA-based 501c3 nonprofit whose registered office is at 1501 4th Ave, Seattle, WA 98101. These terms and conditions do not constitute an agreement with DonorsChoose.

Awards will be limited to public middle and high U.S. schools only. To qualify, a school representative (staff, teacher, principal) must fill out the [submission form](/prize). One middle school and one high school in every U.S. state and in D.C. will receive a $10,000 gift code for DonorsChoose.org, which may be used to fund a project(s) of the school’s creation through the DonorsChoose marketplace. The award is as stated and no cash or other alternatives will be offered. The awards are not transferable. All gift codes will expire on November 30, 2023, which date cannot be extended.

To clarify, this is not a sweepstakes or a contest involving pure chance.

1) There is no financial stake or risk involved in applying - any public school may participate, without any payment to Code.org or any other organization.

2) Award selections will be made only from public middle and high U.S. schools who fill out the [submission form](/prize) and commit to (1) establishing a new Computer Science Principles, Computer Science A, or Computer Science Discoveries course using Code.org; (2) providing a short statement of support from district leadership for expanding of CS opportunities as a district priority; and (3) organizing a school-wide Hour of Code event during Computer Science Education Week (December 5-11, 2022)

3) Award recipients will be selected by Code.org, exercising its sole and final discretion, based on a number of factors: including whether they meet all of the conditions for entry, student demographics (we will prioritize schools with 40% or more of students who qualify for free or reduced meal and/or schools with 40% or more of students who identify as Black, Hispanic/Latino, Native American or Native Alaskan, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, or multiracial), the school’s plan for the Hour of Code or other CSEdWeek event, and the school’s plan for expanding access to CS for students beyond the course addition.

By submitting this form, a participant is indicating his/her agreement to be bound by these terms and conditions, as well as the Code.org [terms of service](/tos) and [privacy policy](/privacy). Code.org bears no responsibility for entries not received for whatever reason. Any information you provide will be provided solely to Code.org and not to any other party.

Code.org's decision on eligible submissions and awards will be made in its sole and final discretion. All such decisions are final. The schools selected for awards will be notified by email by an employee of Code.org. If any selected school cannot be contacted or does not claim the award within 1 business week of notification, Code.org reserves the right to withdraw the award and pick a replacement winner.

These terms and conditions will be governed by the laws of the state of Washington, USA, and any disputes will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state or federal courts located in King County, Washington, USA.

Code.org reserves the right to cancel or amend this campaign and these terms and conditions in its sole discretion without notice, including in the event of a catastrophe, war, civil or military disturbance, act of God or any actual or anticipated breach of any applicable law or regulation or any other event outside of Code.org's control - including changes to global or regional health and safety measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
