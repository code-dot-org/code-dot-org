# CS Leaders Prize - Terms and Conditions

This educational campaign is meant to celebrate and promote computer science education. The CS Leaders Prize is managed solely by Code.org, a USA-based 501c3 nonprofit whose registered office is at 1501 4th Ave, Seattle, WA 98101, USA. These terms and conditions do not constitute an agreement with DonorsChoose.

Prizes will be limited to public middle and high U.S. schools only. To qualify, a school representative (staff, teacher, principal) must fill out the submission form on this page. One middle school and one high school in every U.S. state and in D.C. will receive a $10,000 gift code via DonorsChoose.org, which may be redeemed towards purchases on the DonorsChoose marketplace. The prize is as stated and no cash or other alternatives will be offered. The prizes are not transferable.

To clarify, this is not a sweepstakes or a contest involving pure chance.

1) There is no financial stake or risk involved in applying - any school may participate, without any payment to Code.org or any other organization

2) Winners will only be selected among public middle and high U.S. schools who fill out the submission form on this page and commit to (1) establishing a new Computer Science Principles, Computer Science A, or Computer Science Discoveries course using Code.org; (2) providing a short statement of support from district leadership for expanding of CS opportunities as a district priority; and (3) organizing a school-wide Hour of Code event during Computer Science Education Week (December 5-11, 2022)
