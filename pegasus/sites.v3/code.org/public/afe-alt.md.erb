<img src="/images/marketing/afe-2020.jpg" style="width:45%; float:right; margin-left:25px; margin-bottom:10px">

Computer science is a foundational subject for a 21st century education. Students who study CS [perform better in other subjects, excel at problem solving, and are 17% more likely to attend college](https://medium.com/@codeorg/cs-helps-students-outperform-in-school-college-and-workplace-66dd64a69536). By offering CS to your students, you’re helping create new opportunities for them!

Code.org has partnered with Amazon Future Engineer (AFE) to offer middle and high school teachers at underserved schools a growing number of resources and benefits at no cost!

**The Amazon Future Engineers program is offered to schools with Title 1 status OR that have student enrollment of more than 40% underrepresented minority students and/or 40% students who qualify for free or reduced lunch.**

## The Code.org program
Code.org provides a complete CS program combining [open source K-12 curriculum](https://studio.code.org/courses?view=teacher) with [professional learning](https://code.org/educate/professional-learning/middle-high).

### Engaging curriculum designed to support beginners and challenge students of all levels
Our team designed our courses to support students and teachers new to the discipline, and to engage and challenge students of all levels. Every lesson plan and activity is tested by a diverse mix of classrooms around the country to make sure it’s appropriate and engaging for all students. Both courses we offer for middle and high school students are mapped to the newly revised 2017 CSTA standards.

**Our curriculum and platform are free for anyone, anywhere, to use - always.**

        <p>“Having Code.org in our school has been a priceless commodity! Being a Title I school, a lot of our students don't have access to personal computers or laptops, so they can end up falling behind in terms of technology. We do our best to keep them motivated and show them the potential that learning how to code has on their future.”</p>
