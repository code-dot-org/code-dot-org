# Computer Science Principles #

#### What is CS Principles?
The College Board has proposed a new AP® course called AP® Computer Science: Principles.  The course is designed to be far more than a traditional introduction to programming - it is a rigorous, engaging, and approachable course that explores many of the big, foundational ideas of computing so that all students understand how these concepts are transforming the world we live in. The official AP® exam is set to go live in the 2016-17 school year with an exam and portfolio-based assessment.

AP® is a registered trademark of the College Board.

#### What is Code.org creating for CS Principles?

Code.org is currently creating a complete curriculum consisting of daily lesson plans, videos, tutorials, and assessments that covers the learning objectives from the [CS Principles Curriculum Framework](http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/comp-sci-principles-draft-cf-final.pdf) document. Check back often as batches of lessons will be released on a rolling basis from now until Summer 2015 when the entire curriculum will be publicly available. 

The entire curriculum and the accompanying professional development is scheduled to be ready by Summer 2015.

The resources will be distributed under a [Creative Commons License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/).

#### What is actually in the curriculum?

Several documents describe the overarching themes and direction of the course.

- A [one-pager](/files/CSPcurriculumflyer.pdf) describing Code.org's CSP curriculum project, rationale, and features from the original team of authors in 2013.
- A [visual explanation](/files/CSPCurriculumMap.png) of Code.org's CSP curriculum units and overarching themes.  
- A longer [overview](/files/CSPCurriculumOverview.pdf) of Code.org's CSP curriculum.

#### Overview of lessons from Unit 1: Sending Bits

The first batch of lessons is broken into 4 sections. See this [section-by-section overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1phM8ieBnXH53TJiR3nP9kdJm3FCKjY0akWQmkC0OQVA/pub)

#### Unit 1 Lesson Plans - *COMING SOON*

*Unit 1 is undergoing field testing. Drafts of lesson plans will be published here.*

<br />
	
#### When will lessons actually be published?

Code.org’s CS Principles curriculum will be released publicly on a rolling basis during the 2014-15 school year as lessons are tested in classrooms and supporting materials refined.  They will still be considered “drafts” at that point, but they will at least have gone through one iteration of testing with real teachers.  

<br />


#### Can I test lessons and give feedback?

Yes, please!  Once lessons are published on the website we will invite anyone and everyone to try them out - both the lessons and any new tools or software - and let us know how it went.  We are open to changes to lessons or alternatives to certain lessons so please send us your feedback.
 
We are hoping that our curriculum will be a form of living document and not something set in stone.  The process for giving feedback and making suggestions will be outlined at the time lessons go online.

#### How/Where can I get Professional Development for this course?

In-person professional development for the Code.org CSP course will be available in select partner districts starting in summer 2015. After one year of piloting and refining the PD program we will make all of our PD agendas, schedules, and other materials available to the public. This includes all of our online and in-person PD programs.
