# Computer science for elementary school
Code.org has developed an elementary school curriculum that allows even the youngest students to explore
the limitless world of computing- at no cost for schools. The courses blend online, self-guided and self-paced tutorials with “unplugged”activities that require no computer at all. Each course consists of about 20 lessons that may be
implemented as one unit or over the course of a semester. Even kindergarten-aged pre-readers can participate.

## No cost professional development workshops- at no cost near you (US only)
Code.org is offering amazing, zero-cost, 1-day workshops to prepare educators and content-area teachers (librarians, tech-ed specialists, etc.) to introduce computer science basics in a format that's fun and accessible to the youngest learners (grades K-5).  The workshop will cover content for all three courses and teachers will receive the supplies they need to teach the course- at no cost.

These workshops will be led by experienced Code.org K-5 Facilitators in over 60 cities across the United States.

By the end of each course, students can create interactive games or stories that they can share with anyone.

The courses are flexible so educators can tailor them to their class based on their students’ developmental
level and prior experience. The lessons align to [CSTA Computer Science](https://csta.acm.org/Curriculum/sub/K12Standards.html) and [ISTE](http://www.iste.org/standards/standards-for-students) standards, and reinforce concepts and skills taught in other subject areas by integrating national [Math](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/), [English Language Arts](http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/), and
[Science](http://www.nextgenscience.org/next-generation-science-standards) standards.

## Teacher Dashboard
The Code Studio teacher dashboard makes it easy for teachers to view lesson plans, create student accounts and monitor student progress. Students don't need an email address to have an account in Code Studio. Students can even log-in with a picture instead of a text password.
