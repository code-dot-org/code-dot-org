# Template Language for School District Agreements

## Template language governing student achievement data provided by school districts to Code.org's independent evaluator

#### The language below is template language to be used in Code.org’s partnerships with school districts:

Each Code.org district may or may not have the language below included in their contract, depending on whether or not the district decides to participate in a research study evaluating the impact of the Code.org program.

Specific district partnership documents are managed by each individual district, who may decide the process for providing public access to those documents.

As stated in our privacy policy, we’re deeply committed to creating a safe and secure environment for our students and teachers. We take the protection of this information seriously.

- Any student achievement data provided by Code.org school district partners will be used **solely** for the purpose of evaluating our work.
- The data will be **anonymous / de-identified** (per standard industry practice), requested per the district’s standard process, consistent  with all relevant laws governing such data, and used solely to enable third-party studies of long-term academic outcomes for students taking our courses.
- Most importantly: Code.org will **not** receive any student achievement data from districts  - we ask districts to deliver data to our third party evaluator, CEMSE (at University of Chicago) who has been chosen for their experience and track-record of evaluating education initiatives and education data.

### LANGUAGE FOR INCLUSION IN MAIN DISTRICT CONTRACT

The appendix below will be referenced from the main body of the contract between Code.org and school districts using the following sentence. Other than the Appendix B, this sentence will be the **only** language in the contract regarding evaluation or student data. An “Entity” is a school district.

“EVALUATION -- The Entity agrees to Code.org’s Evaluation, Assessment and Data Security requirements listed in Appendix B.”

### APPENDIX TO MAIN DISTRICT CONTRACT

Appendix B -- Evaluation and Data Security

**I. Evaluation Program**

Code.org assists and supports participating Entities in implementing the Code.org Program. Code.org continually researches and evaluates the effectiveness of the Code.org Program in order to update instructional, curricular and assessment materials and otherwise improve the instruction that participating Entities provide to students. These efforts include the development and validation of assessments, surveys and/or other measurement tools during an Entity’s participation in the Code.org Program.

Code.org, through its designated representative(s) for evaluation, hereafter referred to as “Evaluator”, will provide, and the Entity will participate in, the Code.org systematic assessment and evaluation process. The Evaluator will be a neutral third party. The Entity will assist Code.org and Evaluator in working through the Entity’s standard procedures for obtaining access to data for the purposes of evaluation as detailed below. The Entity may provide the Evaluator with individual student achievement and assessment data and limited demographic data (as detailed below). The Entity may facilitate student participation in survey and interview data collection conducted by the Evaluator. Entity will not provide Code.org any individual student achievement or demographic data, but will provide Code.org with classroom and school average scores on Code.org assessments. Individual student data given to the Evaluator by the Entity shall be de-identified and contain a unique de-identified student number that cannot be used to re-identify the student (for example, a one-way mapped version of the Entity student ID). This de-identified student data will be used solely for the purpose of analyzing student performance over time and contain no personally identifiable student information. 

**II. Assessments and Examinations**

For each of the High School courses (Exploring Computer Science and Computer Science Principles), Entity must administer the most current version of the unit and end-of-course assessments provided by Code.org to its students.
 
Entity must administer the assessments in accordance with guidelines specified by Code.org, and any deviation from those guidelines must be documented by Entity and approved by Code.org.

**III. Evaluation Scope**

The evaluation will be used to improve the Code.org program (curriculum and implementation) and seeks to answer questions such as the following: 

- How effectively do teachers prepared by the Code.org program teach computer science?
- Do the students in the Code.org program learn computer science?
- What impact does studying computer science have on these students’ other academic achievements (for example in mathematics, science, and English)?


The Entity may provide the Evaluator de-identified individual student data (with a unique de-identified student number for the purposes of analyzing student performance over time):

- Computer science assessment results of students, both before and after participation in the Code.org program.
- De-identified student demographic information: gender, ethnicity, grade level, free/reduced-lunch status, English language learner status, graduation status, and special education status. If certain demographic information (such as ethnicity) would allow direct identification of specific students, it should be excluded from data provided by Entity to Evaluator.
- Standardized test scores of students, both before and after participation in the Code.org program, for a test group and a comparable or matched group of students only if the Entity will participate in the study of computer science impact on other test scores.

The Entity will provide the Evaluator other support necessary for carrying out the evaluation, including facilitating parent/guardian permission, providing teacher registration and/or student rostering/registration information.

The Evaluator may request longitudinal de-identified student achievement data for the current year, the preceding two (2) years until the end of a student’s participation in the program.

**IV. Data Security**

Code.org protects data and other records in keeping with the letter and spirit of applicable federal, state and local law. 

Code.org will not receive any individual student achievement or demographic data from Entity or from the Evaluator. However, through Code.org’s tutorial platform, Code.org may collect student data from students enrolled in courses within and outside of the Entity. This may include data such as student logins as well as student progress and achievement on online tutorials within Code.org’s tutorial platform. Students participating through Code.org’s tutorial platform can use accounts set up by the Entity or by their teachers, and will be allowed (but not required) to provide email addresses. Code.org has a Privacy Policy which governs Code.org’s use, sharing and collection of data that Code.org has access to or collects through its programs, including its online tutorial platform. The Privacy Policy can be found at: [http://code.org/privacy](http://code.org/privacy).

Code.org may receive other, non-student information, from the Entity from time to time. Code.org implements reasonable safeguards and precautions to secure data and protect against unauthorized access to its systems and data, and will only share information that it collects or receives, either from the Entity or from its other activities, in accordance to Code.org’s Privacy Policy and in accordance with the District Agreement, to which this Appendix is attached. 

Code.org will require the Evaluator to use and maintain any data given to the Evaluator by the Entity for the purposes set forth above and only in accordance with reasonable privacy/security measures, proper professional practices, student confidentiality and applicable federal, state and local laws, including the Family Educational Records and Privacy Act (“FERPA”). The Evaluator will be prohibited from using or disclosing the student data for any commercial purpose. The Evaluator is the only party, besides the Entity, that shall have access to the de-identified student data given to the Evaluator by the Entity.

The Entity will be responsible, where applicable, for implementing annual notifications, obtaining any necessary student, parent or guardian consents, record-keeping and other such privacy requirements relating to these services.
