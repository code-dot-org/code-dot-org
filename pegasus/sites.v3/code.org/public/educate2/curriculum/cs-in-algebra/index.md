# Computer Science in Algebra
### Powered by Bootstrap

Code.org has partnered with [Bootstrap](http://www.BootstrapWorld.org) to develop a curriculum which teaches algebraic and geometric concepts through computer programming. The twenty lessons focus on concepts like order of operations, the Cartesian plane, function composition and definition, and solving word problems - all within the context of video game design. By shifting classwork from abstract pencil-and-paper problems to a series of relevant programming problems, Code.org CS in Algebra demonstrates how algebra applies in the real world, using an exciting, hands-on approach to create something cool.

At the end of the course, students will have written programs to build composite images, animations, and a complete video game of their own design, all of which can be shared to demonstrate mastery of programming and algebra. For more information, you can view our [Course Overview](/curriculum/docs/algebra/overview) and [Course Framework](/curriculum/docs/algebra/framework).

CS in Algebra is aligned to Common Core Standards for Mathematics, making it possible to integrate our curriculum into the classroom smoothly. CS in Algebra is also a model implementation of Common Core Standards for Mathematical Practice, offering explicit pedagogical recommendation across all eight practice standards. Our curriculum also satisfies several of the CSTA (Computer Science Teacher's Association) standards across levels 1 (grades K-6) and 2 (grades 6-9). For more information, you can view our [complete standards alignment](/curriculum/docs/algebra/standards).

## How do I start teaching CS in Algebra?

To offer CS in Algebra in your school, teachers are required to attend a multi-phased professional development program. The professional development program is only available in the context of a full school district partnership with Code.org. [Inquire about a District Partnership](/educate/districts) to bring CS in Algebra to your entire district. Or learn more about [middle school professional development](/educate/professional-development).

## Try Bootstrap's Hour of Code tutorial
The Computer Science in Algebra course was inspired by and developed in partnership with [Bootstrap](http://www.BootstrapWorld.org). If you enjoyed CS in Algebra and you want to go further with your students, Bootstrap uses WeScheme instead of block based programming and allows you and your students to explore more complex apps, games or algebraic concepts such as recursion. If you would like to try WeScheme, or you're looking for an Hour of Code tutorial for an algebra class, we recommend this short, 1 hour tutorial designed for beginners.
