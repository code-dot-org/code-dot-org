# Elementary School 

## Code Studio

Code.org's Code Studio developed an elementary school curriculum that allows even the youngest students to explore the limitless world of computing. The courses blend online, self-guided and self-paced tutorials with “unplugged” activities that require no computer at all. By the end of each course, students can create interactive games, stories, and art that they can share with anyone. 

For information about our Elementary school computer science courses, see [this page](http://code.org/educate/k5).

# Middle School #

Code.org has two interdisciplinary modules at the middle school level. Code.org has partnered with the award-winning Project GUTS (Growing Up Thinking Scientifically) to create [CS in Science](http://code.org/curriculum/mss), and Code.org has partnered with Bootstrap to offer [CS in Math](http://code.org/curriculum/msm). Each module exists as multiple sets of topical lessons that are able to be integrated into pre-existing Science and Math classes.

# High School 

## Exploring Computer Science
Leveraging years of research by the [National Science Foundation](http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503582&org=CISE), Exploring Computer Science is a nationally recognized introductory college preparatory computer science course and includes curriculum, professional development, and assessments. ECS is composed of six foundational units with lessons that are designed to promote an inquiry-based approach to teaching and learning foundational concepts in computer science and highlighting the computational practices and problem solving associated with doing computer science. The PD experience for ECS is based on three major pillars: computer science content/concepts, inquiry, and equity.

## Computer Science Principles

The College Board has proposed a new AP® course called AP® Computer Science: Principles.  The course is designed to be far more than a traditional introduction to programming - it is a rigorous, engaging, and approachable course that explores many of the big, foundational ideas of computing so that all students understand how these concepts are transforming the world we live in. The official AP® exam is set to go live in the 2016-17 school year with an exam and portfolio-based assessment. Find more information about the CS Principles project at: [http://apcsprinciples.org/](http://apcsprinciples.org/)

AP® is a registered trademark of the College Board.
