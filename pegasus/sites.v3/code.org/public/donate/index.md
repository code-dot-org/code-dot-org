## We use donations to work towards these main objectives:

- **Bringing computer science to schools** - through district partnerships, teacher training and free, online courses.
- **Modernizing curriculum** - developing fun, engaging tutorials and coursework for all levels.
- **Changing state policies** - computer science doesn't count as math or science in most states. We're changing that.
- **Increasing diversity** - encouraging women and students of color, who are sorely underrepresented in computer science.
- **Raising awareness** - we're making it known: it should be a national imperative to get more students to code.

## Results so far:

- 42 million students have done the Hour of Code since December 2013.
- 40,000 teachers began teaching our online course to 1.5 million students
- 31 districts (including 3 of the top 6) partnered with us to bring computer science to 100+ high schools
- 14 states changed policies to make computer science  count toward high school graduation requirements.

**Our current donors and partners:**

Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Juniper Networks, Salesforce.com, LinkedIn, JP Morgan Chase & Co. [See full list](/about/donors)

To maintain nonprofit status, we need small donations to add up to 1/3 of our funding. Every dollar counts.
