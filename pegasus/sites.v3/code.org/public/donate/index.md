## For every dollar you give, one child will learn computer science

We use donations to work towards these main objectives:

- **Bringing computer science to schools** - through district partnerships, teacher training and free, online courses.
- **Modernizing curriculum** - developing fun, engaging tutorials and coursework for all levels.
- **Changing state policies** - computer science doesn't count as math or science in most states. We're changing that.
- **Increasing diversity** - encouraging women and students of color, who are sorely underrepresented in computer science.
- **Raising awareness** - we're making it known: it should be a national imperative to get more students to code.

Please see our [latest progress against these objectives](/about).

Each dollar you give is enough to help one child learn an introductory computer science class. To maintain our nonprofit status, we need small donations to add up to 1/3 of our funding. Every dollar counts.


Our donors include Microsoft, Google, Ballmer Family Giving, Omidyar Network and more. [See full list](/about/donors)
