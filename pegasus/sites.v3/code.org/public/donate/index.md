## For every dollar you give, one child will learn computer science

We use donations to work towards these main objectives:

- **Bringing computer science to schools** - through district and regional partnerships, teacher professional learning workshops, and free online courses.
- **Developing curriculum** - creating fun, engaging tutorials and coursework for a K-12 pathway.
- **Changing state policies** - computer science isn't yet a core academic subject in most states. We're changing that.
- **Increasing diversity** - encouraging women and underrepresented minorities to engage in computer science.
- **Raising awareness** - we're making it known: it should be a national imperative to get more students to learn computer science.

Please see our [latest progress against these objectives](/about).

Each dollar you give is enough to help one child learn an introductory computer science class. To maintain our nonprofit status, we need small donations to add up to 1/3 of our funding. Every dollar counts.


Our donors include Microsoft, Facebook, Omidyar Network, the Infosys Foundation, Google, Ballmer Family Giving, and more. [See full list](/about/donors)

Please [contact us](/contact) if you, your company, or your foundation is interested in talking with our team further to better understand our programs and to explore options for investing in our work.
