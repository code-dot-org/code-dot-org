# Employees Volunteer in a Classroom


The Hour of Code volunteer in a classroom program gives your employees the opportunity to be a guest speaker and help students through online tutorials in their local classrooms or via video call. This opportunity is provided year-round, however, the demand for volunteers in our teachers' classrooms is much higher in December during Computer Science Education Week.

Learn more about the Hour of Code [here](https://www.hourofcode.com).

## Steps:

1. Company administrators send [first communication](#communication1) about program to employees
2. Company employees view the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZWz5XX5PXk" target="_blank">Volunteer Training Webinar</a> and other [resources](/volunteer/guide)
3. Company administrators send [second communication](#communication2) to employees about program
4. Teachers reach out to employees who have signed up
5. Employees who were contacted by teachers volunteer in classrooms
6. Employee volunteers receive annual participation and feedback survey
7. Company receives employee signup numbers

**Past volunteer testimony:**

- “The best part of my experience was that the entire class were women and people of color. **It bodes well for the future of our industry** to have a chance to reach and excite these kids.”
- “Especially enjoyed getting to **encourage young girls in tech**. Felt like I was helping the next generation in my local area.”
- “I LOVED seeing how excited the kids were. One amazing thing was that the teachers noticed that some of the **students who didn’t do as well academically were excelling** at thinking like a developer and helping others - giving them a place to feel confident.”
