# After School Coding

Every 21st-century student should have the opportunity to learn computer science. The basics help nurture creativity and problem-solving skills, and prepare students for future careers. Your company, in partnership with a local after school organization (i.e. YMCA, Girl Scouts, Boys and Girls Club, etc.), can help bring computer science opportunities to youth in your area.

## Why teach an after school computer science course?

Software and technology are everywhere, and a basic understanding of how technology works is crucial as technology increasingly drives the world. For young students, [studies](http://successfulstemeducation.org/resources/nurturing-stem-skills-young-learners-prek%E2%80%933) find that if children are exposed to computer science education at early ages they are more likely to take an interest in the subject throughout school and into their professional careers. For high school students, [studies](http://research.collegeboard.org/sites/default/files/publications/2012/7/researchreport-2007-4-ap-students-college-analysis-five-year-academic-careers.pdf) find that they are 6 times more likely to try computer science in college if exposed in high school, and Black and Hispanic students who try AP Computer Science in high school are 7-8 times more likely to major in computer science.

Unfortunately, very few students have the opportunity to actually *create* technology and even fewer U.S. schools teach computer science. Although one of Code.org’s primary objectives is to make computer science curriculum available to every student in K-12 U.S. schools, it will take many years before every school embraces such an approach. In the meantime, it is essential that we ensure that no child is excluded from educational opportunities, and your employees can help fill this gap by volunteering to establish after school or alternative education programs.

## What does the program look like?

Your employees are the feet on the ground, reaching out to after school organizations in their communities. They will be presenting each organization with the opportunity to partner with your company to host a computer science after school program. As such, your employees will not have the full burden of running the program, but can instead help implement, co-teach, volunteer, and inspire students alongside the organization’s trained staff.

## What resources will Code.org offer?

Code.org has developed computer science curriculum that allows even the youngest students to explore the limitless world of computing. Our courses blend online, self-guided and self-paced tutorials with “unplugged” activities that require no computer – which is an important consideration in places where access to technology or an internet-connected computer isn’t available. Each course consists of 20 lessons and can be adapted depending on the length of the program. 

Code.org offers a variety of [resources](/employee-engagement/after-school-1) to make sure that your employees have everything they need to go out into their communities and start an after school computer science program. 

* Templates for flyers and messaging for community outreach
* Fun and innovative computer science curriculum
* Access to an experienced [computer science facilitator](#facilitator) to train volunteers
* Sample [messaging](#email) to engage your employees

Inspire your employees to join the computer science education movement by participating in Code.org’s After School Coding program!

## Train your employees with an experienced Computer Science facilitator

Although your employees may be experienced engineers, we suggest that you reach out to a Code.org trained facilitator to train both your employees and the “co-teacher” from the after school organization that you are partnering with. This facilitator will help your employees have a better understanding of the course material, recognize what would work best for your student age group, and gain insights on how to teach children effectively in order to run a successful after school program.

**What’s in a workshop?**

If your company chooses to hire a facilitator, your employees will receive in-person instruction from an experienced computer science facilitator. This includes an introduction to the Computer Science Fundamentals course, overview of the curriculum that is most appropriate for their after school program, strategies for teaching “unplugged” classroom activities, and best practices on how to lead a classroom.

**Thousands of educators have participated. They rate our workshops 4.8 on a 5 point scale. The majority say, “It’s the best professional development I’ve ever attended.”**

“I can’t think of anything that would improve this workshop. The workshop facilitator was very professional. This is by far the BEST workshop I’ve ever attended!”
