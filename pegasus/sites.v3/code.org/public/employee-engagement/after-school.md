# After School Coding Program

Every 21st-century student should have the opportunity to learn computer science. The basics help nurture creativity and problem-solving skills, and prepare students for future careers. Your company, in partnership with a local after school organization (i.e. YMCA, Girl Scouts, Boys and Girls Club, etc.), can help bring computer science opportunities to students in your area.

## Why teach an after school computer science course?

Software and technology are everywhere, and a basic understanding of how technology works is crucial as technology increasingly drives the world. For young students, [studies](http://successfulstemeducation.org/resources/nurturing-stem-skills-young-learners-prek%E2%80%933) find that if children are exposed to CS education at early ages they are more likely to take an interest in the subject throughout school and into their professional careers. For high school students, [studies](http://research.collegeboard.org/sites/default/files/publications/2012/7/researchreport-2007-4-ap-students-college-analysis-five-year-academic-careers.pdf) find that they are 6 times more likely to try computer science in college if exposed in high school, and Black and Hispanic students who try AP Computer Science in high school are 7-8 times more likely to major in computer science.

Unfortunately, very few students have the opportunity to actually create technology - games, apps and programs, and even fewer US schools teach computer science. Although Code.org’s primary work is to add computer science into the K-12 curriculum in U.S.  schools, it will take many years before every school embraces such an approach.  In the meantime, it is essential that we ensure that no child is excluded from educational opportunities, and your employees can help fill this gap by volunteering to establish after school or alternative education programs.

## What does the program look like?

Your employees can help bring computer science after school programs to their communities. They are the feet on the ground reaching out to after school organizations in their area to bring the opportunity of providing computer science after school programs in partnership with your company. As such, your employees will not have the full burden of running the program, but can instead help implement, co-teach, volunteer, and inspire students alongside the organization’s trained staff.

## What resources will Code.org offer?

Code.org has developed curriculum that allows even the youngest students to explore the limitless world of computing. Our courses blend online, self-guided and self-paced tutorials with “unplugged” activities that require no computer – which is an important consideration in places where access to an internet-connected computer isn’t available. Each course consists of 20 lessons and can be adapted depending on the length of the program. 

Code.org offers a variety of resources to make sure that your employees have everything they need to go out into their communities and start an after school computer science program.
