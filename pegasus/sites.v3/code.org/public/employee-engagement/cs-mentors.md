# Employees become CS Mentors

If you have software engineers looking for a bigger commitment, our CS Mentors program (in partnership with TEALS) allows them to volunteer two days a week throughout the school year in a local high school computer science class.

[TEALS](http://r.tealsk12.org/tbz7xx) (Technology Education and Literacy in Schools) brings together hundreds of software engineers and teachers to help build sustainable CS classes across the country. Volunteers make an impact in local schools by helping teachers teach Intro and AP CS classes.

Encourage your employees to sign up with this suggested email.

## <a name="communication1" href"communication1"> Encourage employees to become a CS Mentor!</a>

**Purpose:** To announce to your employees about your company’s partnership with Code.org, commitment to CS education, and how your employees can get involved.<br/> 
**Subject:** Calling all Volunteers!<br/> 
**Audience:** Your software engineer employees<br/>

Hello [NAME],

Computer science is the defining field of the 21st century, yet most schools don’t teach it. Join us to help give every student in every school the opportunity to learn!

I am excited to announce that [COMPANY] will be joining Code.org this year to help bring CS education opportunities to all students!

You can join the movement by volunteering to help a local high school teacher two days a week with Teals.

[COMPANY] is proud to participate in this worldwide effort. With your help we will introduce many students to computer science who might not have discovered it otherwise. Technology is transforming the globe—this is our opportunity to transform technology by promoting equity and diversity in the field’s education and career pathways.

Here's what other tech volunteers have said about the experience:

* "Yes, teaching in my living room helps young people. But TEALS has enabled me to make an even larger impact on the kids in my town." - Atul Hatalkar, Principal Engineer
* "Every day I feel more blessed to be part of TEALS, to give something fruitful back to the community. Every day I teach kids I feel more grateful for my life." - Silvia Doomra, Program Manager
* "It’s not just me teaching computer science; I’m also helping a teacher learn to teach computer science so they can be self-sufficient." - Leonardo Souza, Senior Software Engineer
