    <p>Code.org is a nonprofit organization dedicated to expanding access to computer science in schools. Our vision is that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science, just like biology, chemistry or algebra as a part of their core K-12 education.</p>
    <p>We are especially focused on increasing participation among young women and underrepresented students. Come join our team to help make this vision a reality!</p>

<%=view :values_tiles %>

<div class="careers__unifying-approach">
  <div class="col-66">
    <h3>A unifying approach in a divided world</h3>
    <p>Code.org's global role in the K-12 computer science movement is only possible because we use a unifying approach across diverse and often divided stakeholders. At a time of increasing polarization, the idea of increasing opportunity for students unites people from across the political spectrum. Code.org's team members, students, teachers, and supporters have diverse and diverging viewpoints, and they are all welcome in our mission. <a href="/about/unifying">Read more</a>.</p>
