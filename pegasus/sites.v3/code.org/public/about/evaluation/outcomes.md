# September 2014 - June 2015 Program Report

## What learning outcomes have Code.org students achieved?
<img src="/images/outcomes-2014-15.png" width="100%"/>

[Code Studio](http://studio.code.org), our online learning platform, is designed to host our interactive CS courses.  Students are using [Code Studio](https://studio.code.org), on their own and in classroom settings, to demonstrate the use of a number of computer programming concepts at the scale of tens of thousands of classrooms. 

We saw phenomenal growth in the 2014-15 school year for both student and teacher account creation.

### Table: Code Studio User Growth, Sept 1 2014 - June 30 2015

|  | Student Accounts Created| Teacher Accounts Created|
|---|--------|-----|
| Prior to September 1 2014 | 1,440,227 | 35,976 |
| September 1 2014 through June 30 2015 | 4,466,810 | 111,684 |
| All time (as of August 1 2015) | 6,033,943 | 147,660 |
<br><br>

The diversity of the audience we are reaching is also interesting to note. Across all student accounts that self-reported demographic data, **43% self-identified as female** and **37% self-identified as African-American or Hispanic**. 

By comparison, the [demographic breakdown](/files/APCS-2014.pdf) of students taking the most recent AP Computer Science exam in high school was **20% females** and **17% African American, Hispanic, or other historically underrepresented students**.

### Table: Participation in CS courses by demographic

|  | Code Studio Student Account Holders| AP Computer Science Exam Candidates|
|---|--------|-----|
| % self-identifying as female | 43% | 37% |
| % self-identifying as African American or Hispanic | 20% | 17% |

## CS Fundamentals Course Completion and Concepts Learned

Code.org offers a series of 20-hour long courses we refer to as ["Computer Science Fundamentals."](/educate/k5) These interactive tutorials are hosted on [Code Studio](http://studio.code.org) and complemented by [lesson plans](https://code.org/teacher-dashboard#/plan) teachers can deliver in the classroom. The courses focus on helping students develop skills with basic CS concepts including [sequencing, debugging, loops, conditionals, nested loops, event-handlers and functions](/curriculum/docs/k-5/glossary).

From September 2014 through June 2015, **524,000 students** have solved puzzles that show they’ve demonstrated use of the basics of sequencing, and **394,000** have done the same with debugging. Other concepts have each been demonstrated by **between 50,000-100,000 students**. 

### Table: Number of Students Demonstrating Skill in CS Concepts*

| Since 9/14 | Sequencing | Debugging | Loops | Conditionals | Nested Loops | Event handlers | Functions |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Course 1](http://studio.code.org/s/course1) | 524,776 | 394,986 | 161,185 | -  | -  |  124,559 | -  |
| [Course 2](http://studio.code.org/s/course2) | 516,595 | 140,135 | 219,110 | 90,550 | 65,785 | 273,849 | -  |
| [Course 3](http://studio.code.org/s/course3) | 114,250 | 18,937 | 114,250 | 27,736 | 25,008 | 24,716 | 45,878 |

**"Skill demonstration" is defined as having solved 80% of the puzzles in at least one stage that teaches that concept. Note: If the same student did [CS Fundamentals](/educate/k5) Courses [1](http://studio.code.org/s/course1) and [2](http://studio.code.org/s/course2), they are double counted for a concept. On the other hand, this does not account for learning the concept more deeply by repeating it in different contexts, or at more depth.*
<br/>
<br/>

In looking at our completion data for any of our three 20-hour [CS Fundamentals](/educate/k5) courses versus our shorter [hour long tutorials](/learn), we see unsurprisingly **a higher completion rate** for shorter tutorials than we do for courses which require more time and expertise to complete.

## Teachers Matter

One potential explanation for our high completion rate among young learners is the impact of teachers. Students working on Code Studio courses 2-4 with a teacher’s guidance **are more likely to complete** the course than students working on their own, outside of a classroom setting. his shows how students who complete a course with adult guidance have an advantage, in terms of their overall persistence in learning CS. Teachers also benefit because Code.org focuses on teacher support and professional development.

 The table below shows the "teacher advantage" for completing a given percentage of each course, where teacher advantage is the percent more likely you are to complete that much of the class if you have a teacher. Ex: 26 means you are 26% percent more likely to do 20% of course1 if you have a teacher.

### Table: Student Course Completion With Teacher vs. Without
| Course Name | 20% | 30% | 40% | 50% | 60% | 70% | 80% | 90% | 100%|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [20-hour](https://studio.code.org/s/20-hour) | 2 | 2 | 6 | 3 | 0 | 0 | -7 | -17 | -44 |
| [Course 1](http://studio.code.org/s/course1) | 26 | 28 | 22 | 22 | 17 | 11 | 0 | -15 |-25 |
| [Course 2](http://studio.code.org/s/course2) | 100 | 86 | 82 | 78 | 63 | 67 | 60 |67  | 100 |
| [Course 3](http://studio.code.org/s/course3) | 60 | 50 | 57 | 50 | 60 | 40 | 50 | 33 | 100 |
| [Course 4](http://studio.code.org/s/course4) | 80 | 91 | 89 | 75 | 117 | 83 | 100 | 100 | 100|
<br/>
<br/>

Students who are learning with the support of their teacher in a classroom setting complete courses more than those learning on their own, supporting Code.org’s focus on a mix of teacher development and self-guided material.

## Measuring Learning Outcomes for ECS

During the 2014-15 school year, Code.org partnered with [Exploring Computer Science (ECS)](http://www.exploringcs.org) to deliver professional development for the program at scale. In order to gauge the impact of that work, Code.org conducted a pilot evaluation of student learning outcomes in [Exploring Computer Science (ECS)](http://www.exploringcs.org) using a concepts assessment developed with Outlier as well as a programming test developed independently on Code Studio. Results are promising, but more rigorous design is needed to validate and measure mastery learning and transfer. 

A [programming challenge](https://studio.code.org/s/CodeStudioPuzzleChallenge/) was designed by Code.org and piloted to about 1,000 ECS students via Code Studio to see if student programming skills would transfer to a different environment. The data below shows the percentage of students who successfully completed a puzzle challenge related to a particular concept/task (untimed, no hints, unlimited attempts). Further work is required to validate and revise the questions.

### Table: Programming challenge pilot results (delivered through Code Studio, N=~1000).

|Concept/Task | Success Rate|
|---|---|
|Repeat loop with a single command in it | 87%|
|Repeat loop with multiple commands in it | 95%|
|If-then statement | 94%|
|Multiple if-then statements | 93%|
|Draw geometric shapes using a repeat loop with multiple commands in it | 99%|
|Variables | 89%|
|For-loops with a variable (not explicitly taught in ECS) | 65%|
|Nested repeat loops (not explicitly taught in ECS) | 72%|

<br /><br/>
Further work is required to validate and revise the questions.
