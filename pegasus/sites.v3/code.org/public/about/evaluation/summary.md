# Code.org's Impact on Computer Science Education: September 2014 - June 2015 Program Report
<img src="/images/summary-2014-15.png" width="100%"/>

Code.org is is a non-profit dedicated to expanding participation in computer science by making it available in more schools, and increasing participation by women and underrepresented students of color. Code.org partners with [Outlier Research & Evaluation at the University of Chicago](http://outlier.uchicago.edu/), a third-party evaluator, to research and understand our impact and progress towards meeting our mission. This report summarizes our program evaluation work for September 2014 through June 2015, which focused on answering the following key questions:

- [What do teachers say about Code.org professional development?](#pd)
- [How successful have our district partnerships been in driving short- and long-term outcomes in each region?](#partners)
- [What learning outcomes have Code.org students achieved?](#outcomes)
- [How does learning Computer Science impact learning other subjects?](#learning)
- [What next steps can Code.org take to improve our programs?](#nextsteps)

## Evaluation Design
We have gathered data from a number of sources -- internal data collected via Code Studio as well as external data collected by third parties -- in order to evaluate our impact and make decisions about future program direction. We are currently hiring for an [internal evaluation manager](/about/jobs#Eval) to work in collaboration with Outlier, in order to expand our ability to study student learning outcomes. All data cited in this summary are available [upon request](mailto:teach@code.org).

## <a name="pd" href="#pd">What do teachers say about Code.org professional development?</a>

During the 2014-15 school year, Code.org prepared over 11,000 teachers across K-12 attended Code.org workshops. We offered [professional development](/educate/professional-development) through two models:

- a day-long, face-to-face workshop delivered to K-5 teachers by trained facilitators, via our [Affiliate Program](/educate/k5-affiliates) or by Code.org trainers via our [District Partnership Program](/educate/k5-district-partnerships)
- a multi-phase, year-long blended PD experience delivered to Middle and High School teachers via our [District Partnership Program](/educate/districts)

## Key Finding: 
Through our professional development efforts, we are helping a large, diverse audience of K-12 educators feel more prepared to teach Computer Science using [Code.org](/educate) resources. <br /><br/>

### Table: Overall Participation and Satisfaction in Code.org Professional Development, Sept 1 2014 - June 15 2015

|  | Affiliate-Trained Teachers | Code.org-Trained Teachers |
|---|--------|-----|
| Number of teachers trained   | 9,290 | ~1,600 |
| I would recommend the PD to others   | 98% | 97% |
| This was the best PD ever   | 66% | 81%|
| I feel prepared to teach CS   | 94% | 88% |

## <a name="partners" href="#partners">How successful have our district partnerships been in driving short- and long-term outcomes in each region?</a>

In 2014-15, Code.org [partnered with over 70 districts](/educate/districts) across the United States to bring curriculum, professional development and support to over 1,600 new CS teachers.

## Key Finding: 
Through our district partnerships, we are helping districts increase the priority of computer science locally in the face of some big challenges. <br /><br/>

Additionally, Code.org studied the attitudes of administrators and counselors in an effort to understand the relationship between school leadership and program sustainability. Further study is warranted.

## <a name="outcomes" href="#outcomes">What learning outcomes have Code.org students achieved?</a>

## Key Finding: 
Students across thousands of Code.org classrooms have demonstrated the ability to use computer science and computer programming concepts, starting as early as elementary school. <br /><br/>

[Code Studio](http://studio.code.org), our online learning platform is designed to host our interactive CS courses. All online courses  are complemented by lesson plans teachers can deliver in the classroom. We saw phenomenal growth in the 2014-15 school year for both student and teacher account creation.

### Table: Code Studio User Growth, Sept 1 2014 - June 30 2015

|  | Student Accounts Created| Teacher Accounts Created|
|---|--------|-----|
| Prior to September 1 2014 | 1,440,227 | 35,976 |
| September 1 2014 through June 30 2015 | 4,466,810 | 111,684 |
| All time (as of August 1 2015) | 6,033,943 | 147,660 |
<br><br>

The diversity of the audience we are reaching is also interesting to note. Across all student accounts that self-reported demographic data, **43% self-identified as female** and **37% self-identified as African-American or Hispanic**. 

By comparison, the [demographic breakdown](/files/APCS-2014.pdf) of students taking the most recent AP Computer Science exam in high school was **20% females** and **17% African American, Hispanic, or other historically underrepresented students**.

### Table: Participation in CS courses by demographic

|  | Code Studio Student Account Holders| AP Computer Science Exam Candidates|
|---|--------|-----|
| % self-identifying as female | 43% | 37% |
| % self-identifying as African American or Hispanic | 20% | 17% |
<br/>
<br/>

Overall, Code Studio course participation and completion are high, and basic measures of learning are encouraging. Students who are learning with the support of their teacher in a classroom setting complete courses more than those learning on their own, supporting Code.orgâ€™s focus on a mix of teacher development and self-guided material.

## <a name="learning" href="#learning">How does learning computer science impact learning other subjects?</a>

Although we are still early in terms of making a direct link between computer science course participation and learning gains in other subjects, a number of recent studies by our partners have shown interesting positive results connecting CS experience with performance in Math and other fields.<br /><br/>

## <a name="nextsteps" href="#nextsteps">Next Steps: Implications for the 2015-16 School Year</a>

Our 2015-16 evaluation plan, developed in concert with [Outlier](http://outlier.uchicago.edu/), covers:

- Student outcomes on curricular (part of the course materials) and extra-curricular assessments (general CS concepts test).
- Changes in student attitudes about the value and relevance of computer science, sense of belonging, and self-efficacy, using pre/post survey data. 
- Program improvement based on classroom implementation studies and teacher feedback.
- Teacher pre/post attitudinal and pedagogical outcomes.
- Effect of CS in Algebra and K-5 courses on Math/Science/Reading scores.
- Additionally, [Outlier](http://outlier.uchicago.edu/) will work with our district partners to develop sustainability plans.

Internally, through participant surveys and data science projects, we will continue to study:

- Workshop satisfaction (including online PD components)
- Student outcomes measured through Code Studio
