**January, 2016**

At Code.org, we’re big believers in metrics. As you can see on our [About page](/about) or our [2015 Annual Report](/about/2015), we publish many of the metrics we use to track progress across all our programs, and there are hundreds of other smaller ways we make sure our work is moving the needle. 

Headline metrics such as “200 million [hours served](/loc)” or “11 billion [lines of code](/loc)” sound impressive, but, there's a lot more to measuring impact.

Given the hundreds of global partners and 198,000 organizers who support the Hour of Code campaign for CS Education Week, we want to celebrate *your* efforts by sharing some ways this grassroots campaign is changing the world.

## The goal: breaking stereotypes and opening doors
The Hour of Code is at its core not about learning a brand new skill in just one hour. One hour isn’t enough to learn how to code. It's about increasing access to computer science by breaking stereotypes and opening doors.  Somebody may learn programming concepts like loops, conditionals, or basic debugging through the Hour of Code. But a much more important goal is for students and teachers to learn that computer science is fun — you can start at any age, in any classroom, even if you don’t have a computer.

**The Hour of Code is not limited to one hour of coding.** Thousands of the events during Computer Science Education Week go beyond one hour, and involve activities other than coding, all under the umbrella celebration of Hour of Code.  


## The most important measures of impact
After the Hour of Code, we asked participating organizers how it went and got some fantastic news for our field. 

* **98%** had a good or great experience.
* **85%** of those new to computer science said the Hour of Code increased their interest in teaching computer science. 
* **49%** said they plan to continue teaching computer science beyond one hour.
* **18%** said they began teaching computer science after a previous Hour of Code campaign!
* **87%** said their students did more than just one hour of coding.

When we consider the diversity of these students, and the global participation in this campaign, stretching from urban schools in Los Angeles, Chicago, Brooklyn, to refugee camps in Syria and Palestine, it is inspiring to read this feedback.

More in-depth survey results are detailed below.

"I loved it, purely and wholly. It was fun to do, I want to just do that over and over again because I really enjoyed what I could do with it. I enjoyed its interactivity and how it felt to control what happened, it felt really satisfying to me. I wish we could do it every day."

## Harder to measure - the changing landscape of CS education

In our 2015 annual report, we recently reported on the [changing landscape of CS education](/about/2015). The data clearly shows that Americans widely support our vision that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science:

* **90%** of parents want their child’s school to teach computer science
* **75%** of Americans believe computer science is cool in a way it wasn’t 10 years ago
* **67%** of parents and **56%** of teachers believe students should be *required* to learn computer science. This demand is highest among parents or teachers of low-income students.
* **50%** of Americans rank CS as one of the two most important subjects of study after reading and writing (70% also chose math), ahead of other sciences, history, arts, or foreign languages.

While it’s impossible to measure how much of the above is due to the Hour of Code campaign, with one out of every 3 U.S. schools participating and tens of millions of students engaged, this campaign has certainly played a role.

Also, in the 2 years since the first Hour of Code campaign, the largest cities in the U.S. have embraced computer science, and so have many states, and even entire countries have announced national curriculum plans. One cannot measure exactly how much the Hour of Code campaign has impacted these things, but the anecdotes show that the impact is real.  We have heard from countless educators - in cities like Chicago, states like Utah, or countries like Italy - that grassroots participation in the Hour of Code helped build support for top-down efforts to embrace computer science curriculum.  

As one clear example, the 2013 Hour of Code campaign played a pivotal role in Arkansas’ education: [after Asa Hutchinson saw his granddaughter using the Hour of Code tutorials](http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2015/feb/24/hutchinson-signs-measure-expanding-computer-scienc/), he made computer science education part of his gubernatorial campaign platform, and followed it up with [legislation to require computer science to be taught in every high school](http://www.wired.com/2015/03/arkansas-computer-science/). 

Here's an international example, which we discovered almost by accident:

<br/>

We can’t know what the K-12 CS landscape would look like without a grassroots campaign mobilizing hundreds of partners, hundreds of thousands of educators, and tens of millions of students. But what’s clear is that the education landscape has shifted significantly, globally, and we are thankful for *everybody* who has played a supporting role.

## Survey of 198,000 participating educators

Over 40,000 organizers who participated in Hour of Code 2015 completed our survey and shared their experiences. Note: (1) The survey was in English only and does not measure the experience of non-English-speaking organizers. (2) The survey was sent to event organizers and classroom teachers. Many students or adults engage with the Hour of Code on their own, and their experience is not measured by this survey. 

For information about international participation in the 2015 Hour of Code, [see these stats](http://blog.code.org/post/135648100403/you-mightve-heard-about-the-hour-of-code-in-the). 

**Q: What were the demographics of the participating students?**

**A: Internationally: 49% female. Among U.S. participants: 38.5% students of color**

<img src="/images/2015AR/survey2.png" />

Note: Percentages are calculated based on the participating educators’ reports of total student participation by demographic. Students of color are only reported among U.S. participants and include African American, Hispanic/Latino/Latina, Pacific Islander, or Native American/Alaskan Native students.

<br/><br/>
**Q: Overall, how would you rate your Hour of Code experience?** 

**A: 97.5% rated their experience as Good or Great.**

<img src="/images/2015AR/survey1.png" />
<br/><br/>

**Q: Where was your Hour of Code event?**

**A: Events were mostly held in public schools**

<img src="/images/2015AR/survey3.png" />

<br/><br/>
**Q: Does your school already teach/offer a Computer Science class that includes programming or coding?**

**A: 60% reported that their school doesn’t offer such a course.**

* 49%: Yes, I hope to teach coding or computer science beyond one hour
* 6%: No

<br/><br/>

**Q: Did any of your students do coding for longer than one hour?**

**A: 87% of organizers said their students coded for more than one hour**

<img src="/images/2015AR/survey6.png" />



<br/><br/>
**Q: Should we keep the Hour of Code as the centerpiece activity of Computer Science Education Week, and keep “Hour of Code” as the unifying brand for all the other activities that educators organize throughout the week?**

* 98.4%: Yes - stay the course, as long as there are new tutorials and community activities under the Hour of Code umbrella each year. 
* 1.6%: No - I’d prefer something completely different as the centerpiece activity for CS Education Week.

<br/>
**Q: Did a volunteer participate in the Hour of Code through the map we provided?**

* 16%: Yes, someone visited my classroom in person
* 2%: Yes, someone did a video conference with my classroom

## Thousands of volunteers participated

10,000 volunteers signed up to help classrooms with their Hour of Code, mostly in person. These were a mix of software engineers or university students or interested parents.

**Q: How satisfied were you with your volunteer experience?**

**A: 92% were satisfied**

### Example volunteer testimonials

* “The best part of my experience was that the entire class were women and people of color. It bodes well for the future of our industry.”
* “I especially enjoyed getting to encourage young girls in technology. Felt like I was helping the next generation in my local area.”
* “I LOVED seeing how excited the kids were . One amazing thing was that the teachers noticed that some of the students who didn't do as well academically were excelling at thinking like a developer and helping others around them - giving them a place to feel confident."
