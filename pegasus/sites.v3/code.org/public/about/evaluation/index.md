Code.org is is a non-profit dedicated to expanding participation in computer science by making it available in more schools and increasing participation by women and underrepresented students of color. 

Code.org partners with [Outlier Research & Evaluation at the University of Chicago](http://outlier.uchicago.edu/), a third-party evaluator, to understand our impact and progress towards meeting our mission. In the spirit of transparency and in an effort to share best practices with the field, we are pleased to share the results of our evaluation work with the general public.
