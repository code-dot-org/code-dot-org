<img src="/images/impact-hero.png" width="100%"/>

Code.org is is a non-profit dedicated to expanding participation in computer science by making it available in more schools and increasing participation by women and underrepresented students of color. 

Code.org partners with [Outlier Research & Evaluation at the University of Chicago](http://outlier.uchicago.edu/), a third-party evaluator, to understand our impact and progress towards meeting our mission. In the spirit of transparency and in an effort to share best practices with the field, we are pleased to share the results of our evaluation work with the general public.

## Learn More About Our Approach
In this recorded session, you’ll hear from [Pat Yongpradit](http://twitter.com/mryongpradit), Chief Academic Officer at [Code.org](https://code.org) and [Heather King](http://outlier.uchicago.edu/outlier/team/), program manager at [Outlier](http://outlier.uchicago.edu/), about the results of our programs over the course of the 2014-15 school year. What did teachers take away from professional development? What did students learn? What did we learn from our district partnerships? Learn from our successes and challenges as we discuss how we might work together as a CS education community to increase access to CS education for all.
