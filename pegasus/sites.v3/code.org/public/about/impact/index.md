# Results and Impact

Code.org is is a non-profit dedicated to expanding participation in computer science by making it available in more schools, and increasing participation by women and underrepresented students of color. From the beginning Code.org has partnered with [Outlier Research & Evaluation at the University of Chicago](http://outlier.uchicago.edu/), a third-party evaluator, to research and understand our impact and progress towards meeting our mission.

## Code.org Program Evaluation Report: 2014-15 School Year

This past school year 2014-15, Code.org prepared over 10,000 teachers across K-12, with over 6 million students engaged in our courses. Across all these students, **43% are female** and **37% are African-American or Hispanic**. By comparison, [the demographic breakdown of students taking the most recent AP Computer Science exam in high school](http://code.org/files/APCS-2014.pdf) was **20% females**, **17% African American, Hispanic, or other historically underrepresented students**.

This school year, our evaluation work with [Outlier Research and Evaluation](http://outlier.uchicago.edu/) focused on answering the following key questions:

### What impact does Code.org professional development have on teachers?

Through our professional development efforts, we are helping a large, diverse audience of K-12 educators (~1,600 MS+HS, ~10,000 K-5) feel more prepared to teach Computer Science using our resources. <br /><br/>

### How successful have our district partnerships been in driving short- and long-term outcomes in each region?

Through our district partnerships, we are helping districts increase the priority of Computer Science locally in the face of some big challenges. <br /><br/>

### What learning outcomes have Code.org students achieved?

Students are using Code Studio to learn about a number of key CS concepts at large scale. <br /><br/>

### Does learning Computer Science have impact on learning other subjects?

Although we are still early in terms of making a direct link between Computer Science course participation and learning gains in other subjects, a number of recent studies by our partners have shown interesting positive results connecting CS experience and Math performance.<br /><br/>

### Next Steps: Implications for the 2015-16 School Year
Our 2015-16 evaluation plan, developed in concert with [Outlier](http://outlier.uchicago.edu/), covers:

- Student outcomes on curricular (part of the course materials) and extra-curricular assessments (general CS concepts test) as well as pre/post attitudinal change. 
- Program improvement based on classroom implementation studies and teacher feedback.
- Teacher pre/post attitudinal and pedagogical outcomes.
- Effect of CS in Algebra and K-5 courses on Math/Science/Reading scores.
- Additionally, Outlier will work with our district partners to develop sustainability plans.

Internally, through participant surveys and data science projects, we will continue to study:

- Workshop satisfaction (including online components)
- Student outcomes measured through Code Studio

### Evaluation Design
We have gathered data from a number of sources -- internal data collected via Code Studio as well as external data collected by third parties -- in order to evaluate our impact and make decisions about future program direction. We are currently hiring for an internal evaluation manager and data scientist to work in collaboration with Outlier, in order to expand our ability to study student learning outcomes.
