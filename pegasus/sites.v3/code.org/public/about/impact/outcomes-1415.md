# [Results and Impact](/about/impact) > Student Learning Outcomes, 2014-15

## What learning outcomes have Code.org students achieved?

### Summary: Code Studio Course Outcomes
Students are using our learning platform, [Code Studio](http://studio.code.org) to learn about a number of key CS concepts at a scale previously unseen in K-12 education. Participation and completion are high, and basic measures of learning are encouraging. Early attempts to assess learning in HS have been piloted, but more rigorous design is needed to measure mastery learning and transfer. Student who are learning with the support of their teacher in a classroom setting complete courses more than those learning on their own, supporting Code.org’s focus on a mix of teacher development and self-guided material. 

Additionally, Code.org conducted a pilot evaluation of student learning outcomes in ECS using a tool developed with Outlier as well as a test developed independently on Code Studio. Results are promising.

### Detailed Findings: Code Studio Course Outcomes

Since Sept. 2014, **524,000 students** have solved puzzles that show they’ve demonstrated use of the basics of **sequencing**, and **394,000** have done the same with **debugging**. **Other concepts** (including loops, conditionals, event handlers, and functions) have been demonstrated by **between 50,000-100,000 students**. The reach of Code Studio has probably surpassed the reach of any other CS basics course in the US, especially in the lower grades.

**Table: Students and Concepts Demonstrated**
Here is the number of students who have demonstrated skill in  each concept by course (defined as having solved 80% of the puzzles in at least one stage that teaches that concept):


| Since 9/14 | Sequencing | Debugging | Loops | Conditionals | Nested Loops | Event handlers | Functions |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Course 1 | 524,776 | 394,986 | 161,185 | -  | -  |  124,559 | -  |
| Course 2 | 516,595 | 140,135 | 219,110 | 90,550 | 65,785 | 273,849 | -  |
| Course 3 | 114,250 | 18,937 | 114,250 | 27,736 | 25,008 | 24,716 | 45,878 |
*Note: If the same student did course 1 and 2, they are double counted for a concept. On the other hand, this does not account for learning the concept more deeply by repeating it in different contexts, or at more depth.*

- In looking at our completion data for Courses 1-3 versus our hour long tutorials, we see unsurprisingly **a higher completion rate** for shorter tutorials than we do for courses which require more time and expertise to complete. 
- However, the completion rate of our longer courses averages **around 10%**, which compares well with completion rates for other online learning courses such as Coursera and EdX. This is interesting given the fact that our courses target **a much younger audience**. Note: “completion” means solving every single puzzle in the entire course. We don’t believe this is as relevant as the table of concepts demonstrated.
- One potential explanation for our high completion rate among young learners is the impact of teachers. Students working on Code Studio courses 2-4 with a teacher’s guidance **are more likely to complete** the course than students working on their own, outside of a classroom setting. This shows the advantage for a student of having an adult ally in terms of their overall persistence in learning CS, as well as the benefit to Code.org of focusing on teacher support and professional development.

**Table: With Teacher vs. Without**
This table shows the "teacher advantage" for completing a given percentage of each course, where teacher advantage is the percent more likely you are to complete that much of the class if you have a teacher. Ex: 26 means you are 26% percent more likely to do 20% of course1 if you have a teacher.

| Course Name | 20% | 30% | 40% | 50% | 60% | 70% | 80% | 90% | 100%|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 20-hour | 2 | 2 | 6 | 3 | 0 | 0 | -7 | -17 | -44 |
| Course 1 | 26 | 28 | 22 | 22 | 17 | 11 | 0 | -15 |-25 |
| Course 2 | 100 | 86 | 82 | 78 | 63 | 67 | 60 |67  | 100 |
| Course 3 | 60 | 50 | 57 | 50 | 60 | 40 | 50 | 33 | 100 |
| Course 4 | 80 | 91 | 89 | 75 | 117 | 83 | 100 | 100 | 100|

### Summary: Exploring Computer Science (ECS) Learning Outcomes
Additionally, Code.org conducted a pilot evaluation of student learning outcomes in ECS using a tool developed with Outlier as well as a test developed independently on Code Studio. Results are promising.

### Detailed Findings: ECS Learning Outcomes

#### CS Concepts pilot test results: 
A pilot test assessing certain concepts in ECS was given to students in Broward County, FL (N = 365).

- Students did best on tracing conditional structures (56%) and binary numbers (51%). 
- Students performed acceptably on spanning trees (34%) and HTML (41%). 
- Students performed poorest on searching (16%), variables (25%), and loops (15%).
- Overall average student score was 29% correct.

#### CS Concepts programming test results:
A programming test was designed by Code.org and delivered to about 1,000 ECS students via Code Studio.

**Table: Programming test results (designed by Code.org, delivered through Code Studio) (N=~1000).** 

|Concept/Task | Success Rate|
|---|---|
|Repeat loop with a single command in it | 87%|
|Repeat loop with multiple commands in it | 95%|
|If-then statement | 94%|
|Multiple if-then statements | 93%|
|Draw geometric shapes using a repeat loop with multiple commands in it | 99%|
|Variables | 89%|
|For-loops with a variable (not explicitly taught in ECS) | 65%|
|Nested repeat loops (not explicitly taught in ECS) | 72%|
