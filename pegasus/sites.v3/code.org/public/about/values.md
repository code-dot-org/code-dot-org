# Our core values and how we talk about them:

## We believe computer science is foundational for all students
We believe that learning computer science is fundamental to active and informed participation in an increasingly digital society and provides all students with a critical lens for interpreting the world around them. Computer science offers life-changing and economic opportunities, whether they pursue careers in technology or not. We create high-quality, approachable experiences to engage all students in computer science.

## We are committed to equity, access, and opportunity
We believe every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, identity, family income, neighborhood, or where they are from. To achieve this goal, we work to identify and eliminate barriers that have prevented the inclusion and full participation of underrepresented groups in CS.

As an organization, Code.org is committed to providing an inclusive environment, with equitable access and opportunity for growth and advancement for all Code.org staff regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, age, marital status, sexual orientation, or identity.

## We believe in the power of a collaborative education community
We collaborate with teachers, facilitators, and [partners](/about/partners). We value, respect, and learn from the shared expertise of the growing professional computer science education community. We are committed to strengthening this community and we recognize, promote, and amplify the work of all members of this teacher-led movement.

## We’re agile and responsive to feedback
We act quickly but thoughtfully. We make decisions with available information, and actively collect new data to confirm understanding or inform change. We listen broadly and deeply to a diverse audience and are responsive to feedback.

## We act with integrity and transparency
We act in the best interest of our student-focused mission. In this work, we are accountable to and transparent with our team, Board, donors, facilitators, partners, teachers, and community. We believe in trying new ideas, openly sharing our mistakes, and growing and learning from them. We proactively share information, research, data, processes, decisions, and results. Our products and curriculum are purposefully open for anyone to use or contribute. 

## We believe broad impact requires thinking big and acting holistically
We are creating sustainable change in education systems through policies, products, services, and partnerships that impact all levels of education, from the individual student or classroom to entire schools, districts, states, or countries. We strategically use available resources to make long-term investments that will have a positive, lasting impact on students' lives.

# Messages our communications reflect

## "Anybody can learn" (whether you’re a student or teacher)
We believe in opportunity for every student in every school. Anybody can start with the ABCs and 123s of computer science, just like any other field. To go beyond the basics, you need hard work and perseverance. You’ll make mistakes, but that’s how one learns, especially in computer science.  

(Note: we do *not* say "anybody can teach." It takes a LOT to be a great teacher)

## It’s about "computer science," not “code,” and our focus is on schools
Our message is *every school should teach computer science.* Computer science is broader than just coding, just like English is broader than grammar. We picked the shortest name for simplicity. Only the tech-savvy know the difference between computer science, programming, computational thinking, or code. Because our name is "Code.org", we use “computer science” everywhere else to avoid the perception that we’re narrowly focused on coding.

## Computer science is foundational for every child
Even if you don’t want to become an electrician, you still learn about electricity in school. Computer science is the electricity of the 21st century. It’s relevant to every career. But of course, it helps that computer science leads to some of the best careers in the world. And by helping millions of girls or underrepresented minorities learn computer science, we’re not only preparing them for the 21st century, we’re addressing problems with inequality of opportunity or diversity in tech.

## Improving diversity is core to our mission
Computer science is now foundational knowledge for all 21st-century careers, making access to this field a critical equity issue. We embed a [focus on diversity throughout our work](/diversity) – from the Hour of Code, our curriculum design, our work with schools and teachers, to our government affairs. Stereotypes drive girls and students of color away from computer science; we balance this by showcasing diverse role models using computer science to change the world.

## This is a teacher-powered movement
Ours is a grassroots revolution that’s fueled by the passion and support of teachers. We believe in empowering educators, they are our most important agents of change. Many educators feel trapped by bureaucracy or administration. Code.org gives them an outlet to do something great for their students, and we help the administration catch up.

# Clarifying common misconceptions

* We’re about "computer science". (not just about “code”)
* We’re about foundational learning for *all* kids.  (not just about tech jobs)
* We’re about every *school* teaching computer science. (not about every student learning to code)
* We want *computer science* in every school. (not requiring *Code.org* in every school)
* Computer science should be a peer of biology or chemistry, and students should have a chance to learn all these things. (we’re not competing with other fields like math or science)
* We want schools to teach foundational computer science concepts that will stand the test of time. (we’re not about any one coding language or platform)
* We’re lucky to have the generous support of tech companies, but **[we make our own decisions](/about/donation-policy)**. (we’re not run by the tech industry, or by any of our donors)
