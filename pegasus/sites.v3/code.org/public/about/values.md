## We believe computer science is foundational for all students
We believe that learning computer science is fundamental to active and informed participation in an increasingly digital society and provides all students with a critical lens for interpreting the world around them. Computer science offers life-changing and economic opportunities, whether they pursue careers in technology or not. We create high-quality, approachable experiences to engage all students in computer science.

## We are committed to equity, access, and opportunity
We believe every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, identity, family income, neighborhood, or where they are from. To achieve this goal, we work to identify and eliminate barriers that have prevented the inclusion and full participation of underrepresented groups in CS.

As an organization, Code.org is committed to providing an inclusive environment, with equitable access and opportunity for growth and advancement for all Code.org staff regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, age, marital status, sexual orientation, or identity.

## We believe in the power of a collaborative education community
We collaborate with teachers, facilitators, and [partners](/about/partners). We value, respect, and learn from the shared expertise of the growing professional computer science education community. We are committed to strengthening this community and we recognize, promote, and amplify the work of all members of this teacher-led movement.

## We’re agile and responsive to feedback
We act quickly but thoughtfully. We make decisions with available information, and actively collect new data to confirm understanding or inform change. We listen broadly and deeply to a diverse audience and are responsive to feedback.

## We act with integrity and transparency
We act in the best interest of our student-focused mission. In this work, we are accountable to and transparent with our team, Board, donors, facilitators, partners, teachers, and community. We believe in trying new ideas, openly sharing our mistakes, and growing and learning from them. We proactively share information, research, data, processes, decisions, and results. Our products and curriculum are purposefully open for anyone to use or contribute. 

## We believe broad impact requires thinking big and acting holistically
We are creating sustainable change in education systems through policies, products, services, and partnerships that impact all levels of education, from the individual student or classroom to entire schools, districts, states, or countries. We strategically use available resources to make long-term investments that will have a positive, lasting impact on students' lives.
