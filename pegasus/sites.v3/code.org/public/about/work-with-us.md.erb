Code.org is a nonprofit organization dedicated to expanding participation in computer science by making it available in more schools, and increasing participation by women and underrepresented students of color. Our vision is that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science, just like biology, chemistry or algebra. Join our team to help make this vision a reality!
