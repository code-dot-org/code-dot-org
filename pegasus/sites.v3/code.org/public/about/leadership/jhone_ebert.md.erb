As the Superintendent of Public Instruction, Jhone Ebert is proud to lead Nevada’s education system. Her responsibility is to ensure that each of the 500,000 students at the state’s 750 schools has a pathway to thrive in school and life. Reappointed by Governor Joe Lombardo in January 2023, one of her proudest accomplishments is the successful revamp of the State’s 54-year-old funding formula to the more equitable Pupil Centered Funding Plan. The new formula is getting a $2 billion dollar boost from Governor Lombardo’s executive budget proposal. Jhone Ebert has expanded career and technical education opportunities to ensure students are college and career ready, spearheaded effective educator retention and recruitment efforts, and turned Nevada into a leader for computer science education. Jhone is the recipient of numerous professional honors and awards, including the UNLV College of Education Alumna of the Year, the International Society for Technology in Education’s 2020 Annual Impact Award, the National School Boards Association’s Technology Leadership Network 20 to Watch, the CCSD Excellence in Education Hall of Fame Award, and the Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics Teaching.
