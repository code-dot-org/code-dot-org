Anyone who has worked with her can attest that Jhone M. Ebert brings a heart for equity, a collaborative spirit, and transformative leadership to everything she does. She puts these qualities to work each day in her role as Superintendent of Public Instruction for Nevada, where she works tirelessly on behalf of Nevada’s nearly 500,000 students and its 750 schools.

An equity champion, Ms. Ebert has rooted her career in the belief that the work is unfinished until every single child has a clear pathway to thrive in school and life. As State Superintendent of Public Instruction, her proudest accomplishment is Nevada’s innovative and responsive COVID-19 recovery efforts, which enabled Nevada’s districts to successfully adapt to deliver distance education and prepare for safe school re-openings. She has also successfully revamped Nevada’s 54-year-old funding formula, replacing it with a formula that allocates resources in a more equitable, student-centered way.

Ms. Ebert is a life-long learner and her more than 30-year career has been fueled by her belief in the power of public education to change lives. Her honors include the International Society for Technology in Education’s 2020 Annual Impact Award, the National School Boards Association’s Technology Leadership Network 20 to Watch, the CCSD Excellence in Education Hall of Fame Award, and the Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics Teaching.

Ms. Ebert received her Master of Education in Instructional and Curricular Studies from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and her Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics from California State University Fresno.
