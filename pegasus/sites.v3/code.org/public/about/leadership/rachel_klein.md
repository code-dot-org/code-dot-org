Rachel has worked in public education for over 15 years, and believes strongly that learning to code is a basic civil right for young people today. As a district administrator, she worked to increase career awareness and college access for low-income and minority students. 

Rachel has worked as a grantmaker, an evaluator, a technology developer and a restaurant reviewer. At Code.org, she works to increase the number of skilled CS teachers in the country and make sure they feel connected to a community focused on quality, sustainability, and a passion for teaching.
