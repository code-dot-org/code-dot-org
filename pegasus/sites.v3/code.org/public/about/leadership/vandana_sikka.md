Vandana Sikka is a strong advocate of the universal right to education, especially for the disadvantaged. Serving as the chairperson of [Infosys Foundation USA](http://www.infosys.org/infosys-foundation-usa/pages/index.aspx), her passion to make computing education more widely and easily accessible is fueled by the principle that education is a great equalizer to help bridge inequality, develop the skill sets needed for the future, and open up new opportunities. With a master’s degree in computer science, Vandana is founder and CEO of a technology company. She also serves on the Board of Directors of Code.org. Her technology career has spanned product development and management for supply chain and enterprise software companies, including creating one of the first B2B online catalogs at a software startup later acquired by a public company. Vandana’s personal interests include volunteering at her children's schools, traveling, learning from people and different societies and cultures, and designing and making jewelry.Follow Vandana [@VTSikka](https://twitter.com/VTSikka)
