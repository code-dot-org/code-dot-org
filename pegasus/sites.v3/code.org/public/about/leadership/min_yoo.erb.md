Min Yoo is the Director of Marketing and Development at Code.org. Her teams are responsible for building awareness of the need for equitable computer science education, breaking stereotypes surrounding computer science, raising funds, and managing relationships with supporters who enable Code.org to work towards our mission.

Initially intending to become a writer, Min took her first computer science class during her sophomore year at Stanford and graduated two years later with a computer science degree in hand. She has spent over 25 years in roles spanning product management, marketing, and business development at enterprise companies like Oracle to tech startups to her own consulting business.

Min is an ardent believer in the foundational nature of computer science in education, regardless of eventual career path, and the need for equitable access, regardless of gender, race, or socioeconomic background.
