[Pat Yongpradit](http://patyongpradit.com/) is the Chief Academic Officer for Code.org, a non-profit dedicated to promoting computer
science education, and leader of [TeachAI](http://teachai.org/), an initiative to guide education leaders and policymakers in
transforming education in an age of AI. As an international voice on computer science education, Pat has
influenced each stage of the education system, from policy to practice, in the legislature, and in the
classroom. During his career as a computer science teacher, he inspired students to create games and
apps for social causes and broadened participation among underrepresented groups. He led the
development of the [K-12 Computer Science Framework](http://k12cs.org/), was featured in the book, “American Teacher:
Heroes in the Classroom”, was recognized as a Microsoft Worldwide Innovative Educator, and has been
certified in biology, physics, math, health, and technology education. Although Pat currently spends more
time focused on computer science and artificial intelligence from a global perspective, he still finds ways
to sneak into the classroom.
