Parisa Tabriz is a business executive, product and engineering leader, cybersecurity expert, and advocate for underrepresented and underserved people in tech. She is currently Vice President and General Manager of Google Chrome, responsible for the globally distributed organization that builds the world’s most popular web browser. Tabriz is affectionately known as Google's "Security Princess" (her former job title!), and has worked on information security at Google for over a decade, starting as a "hired hacker" software engineer for Google's security team, managing the Project Zero security research team for nearly a decade, finding and closing security holes in dozens of Google's web applications, and teaching others how to do the same.

Outside of Google, Parisa has served as a consultant to the White House U.S. Digital Service to enhance security of government technology, lectured at the Harvard Kennedy School, created and facilitated training for kids interested in learning about security and hacking in a fun and easy way, and consulted with multiple entertainment writers to help them understand the world of cybersecurity and technology so they can create and depict more accurate, diverse stories.

Ms. Tabriz has been featured in WIRED, Fortune, Forbes, Elle, NYTimes, and numerous other online and print publications, and is a character in the “Ara the Star Engineer” children’s book. She holds a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with publications in network security and privacy-preserving technologies.
