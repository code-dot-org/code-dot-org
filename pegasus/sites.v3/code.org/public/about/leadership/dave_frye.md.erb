Dave Frye, Ed.D. is Director of Programs at Code.org, leading the development and execution of our national education programs in support of teachers, students, facilitators and our Regional Partner network.

Dave has over 20 years experience developing strategic, broad-scale initiatives and next-generation education systems that will prepare students for the rapidly changing world in which they will live. Prior to join the Code.org team, Dave worked at the intersection of policy, research, and practice to expand opportunities and broaden participation in CS in North Carolina and nationally. He helped to create and grow the NC CS education initiative, led over $5M in CS education research projects, and partnered with CS education leaders throughout the country to inform solutions and prototype new ideas for reaching schools and students with relevant, compelling CS opportunities.

Dave was a member of the committee that developed the CSTA Standards for CS Teachers (2020), provided leadership for NC in the 23-state Expanding Computing Education Pathways (ECEP) Alliance (2017-20), and he is currently chair of the board of csedreserch.org. He holds an Ed.D. and M.Ed. in Higher Education Administration from NC State, a B.Mus. in Music Education from Youngstown State University (OH), and an A.A.S in Music from Onondaga Community College (NY).

Dave lives in beautiful Door County, WI where he likes to spend his energy exploring the natural world around him and the possibilities it holds with his son Max and wife Carrie.
