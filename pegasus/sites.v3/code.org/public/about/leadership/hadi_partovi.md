Hadi Partovi is a tech entrepreneur and investor, and CEO of the education nonprofit Code.org. 

Born in Tehran, Iran, Hadi grew up during the Iran-Iraq war. His school did not offer computer science classes, so he taught himself to code at home on a Commodore 64. After immigrating to the United States, he spent his summers working as a software engineer to help pay his way through high school and college. Upon graduating from Harvard University with a Masters degree in computer science, Hadi pursued a career in technology starting at Microsoft where he rose into the executive ranks. He founded two startups – the first was a huge success and the second a dismal failure – and he now invests and advises other technology startups.

In 2013 Hadi and his twin brother Ali launched the education nonprofit Code.org, which Hadi continues to lead full-time as CEO. Code.org has established computer science classes reaching 30% of US students, created the most broadly used curriculum platform for K-12 computer science, and launched the global [Hour of Code](http://hourofcode.com) movement that has reached over 100 million students spanning every country in the world.

Hadi has served as an early advisor or investor at many tech startups including [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com), [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com), [airbnb](http://www.airbnb.com), and [Uber](http://www.uber.com). He currently serves on the Board of Directors of [Axon](http://axon.com) and [Convoy](http://www.convoy.com).
