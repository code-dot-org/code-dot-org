Hadi Partovi is a tech entrepreneur and investor, and CEO of the education non-profit Code.org. 

Born in Tehran, Iran, Hadi grew up during the Iran-Iraq war. His school did not offer computer science classes, so he taught himself to code at home on a Commodore 64. After immigrating to the United States, he spent his summers working as a software engineer to help pay his way through high school and college. Upon graduating from Harvard University with a computer science degree, Hadi pursued a career as a technologist at Microsoft, then as an entrepreneur at two startups – one which succeeded and one which failed, and finally as a tech investor.

In 2013 Hadi and his twin brother Ali launched the education nonprofit Code.org, which Hadi continues to lead full-time as CEO. Code.org has established computer science classes in 15% of US classrooms, created the most broadly used curriculum platform for K-12 computer science, and launched the global [Hour of Code](http://hourofcode.com) movement that has reached over 100 million students.

Hadi has served as an early advisor to numerous startups including [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com) and [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com), and as a tech investor his portfolio also includes [airbnb](http://www.airbnb.com), [Uber](http://www.uber.com), [Zappos](http://www.zappos.com), [IndieGogo](http://www.indiegogo.com), [Change.org](http://change.org), and others. Hadi also serves as a Director on the boards of [TASER International](http://taser.com) and [Convoy](http://www.convoy.com).
