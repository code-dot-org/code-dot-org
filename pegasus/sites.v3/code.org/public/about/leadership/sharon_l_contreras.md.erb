Dr. Sharon L. Contreras is passionate about providing high-quality education to each
child with the goal that every student graduates college and career ready.
Sharon L. Contreras is a teacher at heart, a transformational leader and a passionate
advocate for children and education. Growing up in Uniondale, New York with nine
brothers and sisters, she learned early to advocate for her right to an excellent
education. At the age of 10 she was told by her teacher she didn’t belong in the new
gifted program that she knew included classmates she had tutored. After pleading her
case independently, then alongside her parents, she gained a seat in the accelerated
program which changed the trajectory of her life, while lighting a fire for achievement
and advocacy of others.

Years later, not even the gradual loss of 95% of her hearing stopped her from breaking
through barriers for herself and removing them for her students. Over the course of her
30-year education career, she has held two superintendencies – one urban and one in a
county-wide district serving urban, suburban and rural students. As superintendent of
Syracuse City School District, she became the first woman of color to lead one of New
York’s “Big 5” urban school systems and is the first Latina to lead Guilford County
Schools in North Carolina, one of the nation’s largest school districts, with 126 schools,
10,000 employees and 72,000 students.

A true warrior for equity, Contreras is celebrated for implementing policies aimed at
closing achievement gaps and improving life outcomes for all students. Since taking the
lead in Guilford County, she’s helped close the graduation rate gap and vastly
expanded career technical education and Advanced Placement programs, as well as
access to Dual enrollment programming to prepare students and their parents for the
workforce. In 2021, the GCS graduation rate increased to 91.5%.

Contreras was named Superintendent of the Year by the North Carolina PTA (2019), a
North Carolina Regional Superintendent of the Year (2020) by the Piedmont Triad
Educational Consortium and a Top 5 Finalist for the Green Garner Urban Education
Leadership Award by the Council of the Great City Schools (2020). She was among
Triad Business Journal’s Most Admired CEOs in 2020 and is the 2022 AASA Women in
School Leadership Award recipient. Sharon holds multiple degrees including: a Doctor
of Philosophy, Educational Leadership & Policy Analysis and a Master of Science from
the University of Wisconsin-Madison; a Master of Arts, English Literature; a Master of
Arts in Teaching and a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature from the State University of
New York at Binghamton.
