# About Us

Launched in 2013, Code.org&reg; is a non-profit dedicated to expanding access to computer science, and increasing participation by women and underrepresented students of color. Our vision is that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science. We believe computer science should be part of core curriculum, alongside other courses such as biology, chemistry or algebra.

Code.org increases diversity in computer science by reaching students of all backgrounds where they are — at their skill-level, in their schools, and in ways that inspire them to keep learning. Read  about [our efforts to increase diversity in computer science](/diversity).

## More information, history, and philosophy
In 2013, Code.org was launched by twin brothers Hadi and Ali Partovi with a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc) promoting computer science. This video became #1 on YouTube for a day, and 15,000 schools reached out to us for help. Since then, we've expanded from a bootstrapped staff of volunteers to build a full organization supporting a a worldwide movement. We believe that a quality computer science education should be available to every child, not just a lucky few.

To support our goal, we do work across the education spectrum: designing our own courses or partnering with others, training teachers, partnering with large school districts, helping change government policies, expanding internationally via partnerships, and marketing to break stereotypes.

Our work builds upon [decades of effort, by countless organizations and individuals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rdEUqAkYtKPMD4UeEmpZCAau4_AdIOGbZDqLkePAQrY/pub) who have helped establish, fund, and spread computer science education. We're thankful to benefit from the tireless help of the broader computer science education community.

## Donors
Code.org&reg; is a registered public 501c3 nonprofit, with support from the general public. We are grateful for the generous support we’ve received from [individuals and organizations](/about/donors) who support our vision.

Code’s accomplishments (above) demonstrate our ability to leverage those dollars into strong outcomes.  But given our nonprofit ambition that every child in every school should have access to computer science — to become literate citizens in today’s digital world and to test their interests in exploring CS further as a career — we have a long way to go to meet a fundraising goal that will support that vision.
