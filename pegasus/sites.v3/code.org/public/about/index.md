Code.org&reg; is a non-profit dedicated to expanding access to computer science and increasing participation by women and underrepresented minorities. Our vision is that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science, just like biology, chemistry or algebra. Code.org organizes the annual <a href="http://hourofcode.com"> Hour of Code</a> campaign which has engaged 10% of all students in the world and provides the leading curriculum for K-12 computer science in the largest school districts in the United States. Code.org is supported by generous donors including Microsoft, Facebook, the Infosys Foundation, Google, Omidyar Network, and <a href="/about/donors">many more</a>.

## Diversity of students in our courses</h2>

<img src="/images/infographics/fit-800/diversity-courses-updated-05-23.png" class ="col-95">

Code.org increases diversity in computer science by reaching students of all backgrounds where they are — at their skill-level, in their schools, and in ways that inspire them to keep learning. 

For the second year in a row, underrepresented minorities make up 48% of students in our courses. Increasing diversity in computer science is foundational to our work, and <a href="/diversity">we encourage you to read more about our efforts</a>.

## More information, history, and philosophy
In 2013, Code.org was launched by twin brothers [Hadi](/about/leadership/hadi_partovi) and [Ali Partovi](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/ali-partovi#/entity) with a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc) promoting computer science. This video became #1 on YouTube for a day, and 15,000 schools reached out to us for help. Since then, we've expanded from a bootstrapped staff of volunteers to build a full organization supporting a worldwide movement. We believe that a quality computer science education should be available to every child, not just a lucky few.

To support our goal, we do work across the education spectrum: designing our own courses or partnering with others, training teachers, partnering with large school districts, helping change government policies, expanding internationally via partnerships, and marketing to break stereotypes.

Our work builds upon [decades of effort, by countless organizations and individuals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rdEUqAkYtKPMD4UeEmpZCAau4_AdIOGbZDqLkePAQrY/pub) who have helped establish, fund, and spread computer science education. We're thankful to benefit from the tireless help of the broader computer science education community.

## Code.org Advocacy Coalition
The [Code.org Advocacy Coalition](/advocacy) is a bipartisan coalition of corporations and nonprofits that work together to help establish federal and state policies to expand and sustain access to K-12 computer science and to broaden participation and diversity in the field.

## K-12 Computer Science Framework
Code.org is a member of the steering committee that helped establish the [K-12 Computer Science Framework](http://k12cs.org) - a high-level guide for states, districts, and organizations implementing computer science education. The Framework has won the support of hundreds of academics, K-12 educators, software companies, nonprofits, and states.

## Code.org Donors
Code.org&reg; is a registered public 501c3 nonprofit, with support from the general public. We are grateful for the generous support we’ve received from [individuals and organizations](/about/donors) who support our vision.

Code’s accomplishments (above) demonstrate our ability to leverage those dollars into strong outcomes.  But given our nonprofit ambition that every child in every school should have access to computer science — to become literate citizens in today’s digital world and to test their interests in exploring CS further as a career — we have a long way to go to meet a fundraising goal that will support that vision.

Please [contact us](/contact) if you, your company, or your foundation is interested in talking with our leadership team further to better understand our program and to explore options for investing in our work.
