# About Us

Launched in 2013, Code.org&reg; is a non-profit dedicated to expanding participation in computer science by making it available in more schools, and increasing participation by women and underrepresented students of color. Our vision is that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science. We believe computer science and computer programming should be part of the core curriculum in education, alongside other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses, such as biology, physics, chemistry and algebra.

## More information, history, and philosophy
Code.org launched in 2013 as a hobby project of co-founders Ali and Hadi Partovi. Our initial work was a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc) that became #1 on YouTube for a day, and 15,000 schools reached out to us for help. Since then, we've worked to build a worldwide effort to help schools teach computer science. 

Our work builds upon [decades of effort, by countless organizations and individuals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rdEUqAkYtKPMD4UeEmpZCAau4_AdIOGbZDqLkePAQrY/pub) who have helped establish, fund, and spread computer science education. We're thankful to benefit from the tireless help of the broader computer science education community.

We believe that a quality computer science education should be available to every child, not just a lucky few.
