## Permission to use

The CODE® logo design is a registered trademark of Code.org. You may not use the Code.org trademarked logo or other Code.org brand assets without explicit written permission from Code.org. To request permission to use Code.org’s logo or any other brand assets, send an email to permissions@code.org with a description of intended usage and accompanying copy. For visual assets, you will be asked to submit a draft of how the asset will be incorporated.

With express permission from Code.org, you may use our brand assets within the approved scope in accordance to the following rules outlining allowed and prohibited usage. Code.org may require you to stop using our brand assets if we believe that your use falls outside these rules or the scope of any permission we give you.

If you already have a written agreement with Code.org that includes the use of our brand assets, you do not need to submit a request for the rights you already have under that agreement.
