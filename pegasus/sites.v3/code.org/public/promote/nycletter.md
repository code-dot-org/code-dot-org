# Letter to your teacher, principal or district administrator 


<br />

Dear teacher, principal or administrator,
 
Computer science opens more doors for students than any other discipline in today’s world. Learning even the basics will help students in virtually any career—from architecture to zoology. Just as we teach students how to dissect a frog, or how electricity works, it’s important for every 21st century student to have a chance to “dissect an app,” or learn how the Internet works.
 
### Will you help bring computer science to our classrooms?
 
We need to move beyond basic technology education and offer computer science to our students in elementary, middle and high school. One approach is to partner with Code.org, a national nonprofit expanding access to computer science. Their K-12 program consists of an innovative approach to professional development, curriculum, and promotional materials. You can watch their videos about the importance of  computer science at <http://code.org/videos>.

### A NYC-wide partnership with Code.org. No new staff needed

Code.org has partnered with the iZone division of the NYC Department of Education to bring high quality computer science classes to New York middle schools and high schools. 

This partnership provides the full curriculum, professional development, and supports needed for a NYC school to integrate computer science into the curriculum **without hiring new staff**. There are curriculum options for elementary school, middle school, and high school, all at no cost to your school.

Please take action in your classroom or school to make sure our students have access to high quality computer science education. 

You can learn about this opportunity at <http://code.org/nyc>.

Sincerely,

A parent 
<br />
