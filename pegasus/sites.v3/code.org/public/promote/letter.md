# Letter to your teacher, principal or district administrator 


<br />

Dear teacher, principal or administrator,
 
Computer science opens more doors for students than any other discipline in today’s world. Learning even the basics will help students in virtually any career—from architecture to zoology. Just as we teach students how to dissect a frog, or how electricity works, it’s important for every 21st century student to have a chance to “dissect an app,” or learn how the Internet works.

### 90% of parents want schools to teach computer science including computer programming.
A [2015 Gallup poll](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/searching-for-computer-science_report.pdf) sponsored by Google found that 9 out of 10 parents want schools to teach computer science - so our children grow up not just using technology but learning how to *create* it. Among low-income families, the majority of parents believe the computer science should be *required* for most students to learn. A [subsequent poll](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/horizon-media-study-reveals-americans-prioritize-stem-subjects-over-the-arts-science-is-cool-coding-is-new-literacy-300154137.html) shows that 50% of parents consider computer programming the most important subject for students to learn after reading, writing, and math.

 
### Will you help bring computer science  to our classrooms?
 
We need to move beyond basic technology education and offer computer science to our students in elementary, middle and high school. One approach is to partner with Code.org, a national nonprofit expanding access to computer science. Their K-12 program consists of an innovative approach to professional development, curriculum, and promotional materials. You can watch their videos about the importance of  computer science at <http://code.org/videos>.

### Computer science in elementary school
Code.org offers a unique approach to [preparing schools to teach computer science in grades K-5](http://code.org/educate/k5), offering high-quality 1-day workshops nationwide to prepare educators to introduce computer science basics in a format that's fun, accessible and relevant to the youngest learners. Students of all ages enjoy learning these fun and applicable skills.  Any elementary school teacher can sign up for the workshops. Just see <http://code.org/k5>.

### Beyond elementary school
Beyond elementary school, Code.org offers [curriculum](http://code.org/educate/curriculum) and [teacher professional development](https://code.org/educate/professional-development) for middle school and high school teachers. Although the Code.org professional development program for middle school and high school is only available via a [district-wide partnership](http://code.org/educate/districts), the curriculum is free for all to use. And Code.org offers a great list of 3rd party options as well at <http://code.org/educate/3rdparty>.

### Growing participation with an Hour of Code
In addition to supporting computer science courses, we can all help prepare our children for the 21st century by growing participation in this field, and to break the stereotype that coding is only for nerdy white teenage boys. The best way to do this is to have the entire school participate in the international [Hour of Code](http://hourofcode.com) campaign. 

Please take action in your classroom or school to make sure our students have access to high quality computer science education. You can find information about Code.org's entire K-12 program and other options at <http://code.org/educate>.  

Sincerely,

A parent 
<br />
