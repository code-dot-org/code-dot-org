# Letter to middle or high school principal or administrator
</a>

Dear principal or administrator,

Computer science opens more doors for students than any other discipline in today’s world. Learning even the basics will help students in virtually any career—from architecture to zoology. Just as we teach students how to dissect a frog, or how electricity works, it’s important for every 21st century student to have a chance to design an app or learn how the Internet works.

### 90% of parents want schools to teach computer programming, and students love it
A [2015 Gallup poll](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/searching-for-computer-science_report.pdf) found that 9 out of 10 parents want schools to teach computer science - so our children grow up not just using technology but learning how to *create* it. In fact, among low-income families, the majority of parents and teachers believe the computer science should be *required* for students to learn! 

A [survey of high school students shows](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-classes-do-students-like-most-hadi-partovi) that computer science ranks among students' favorite subjects, behind only graphic design and performing arts. Now that [computing is the #1 source of all new wages in the U.S.](blog.code.org/post/144206906013/computing-occupations-are-now-the-1-source-of-new), it's important that every child should have access to learn computer science in schools. 
 
### Will you help bring computer science to our classrooms?
 
We need to move beyond basic technology education and offer computer science to our students in elementary, middle and high school. 

One approach is to partner with Code.org, a national nonprofit expanding access to computer science. They've already partnered with over 120 school districts, and their local regional partner network can work with our schools to provide support, professional development, and currciulum.

We can start with their [resources for schools and districts.](https://code.org/yourschool>)

### Fantastic Code.org curriculum and workshops for teachers
We don't need to hire any new teachers to offer our students this opportunity. Math, science, art, history, and other teachers across the country are learning to teach computer science with Code.org's workshops.

Code.org's high quality [curriculum](http://code.org/educate/curriculum) includes semester or full year courses with all the supports our teachers need. They also have local [teacher professional learning programs](https://code.org/educate/professional-development).

### 3rd party options
Aside from its own programs, Code.org recommends a great list of 3rd party options as well at <http://code.org/educate/3rdparty>.

### Growing participation with an Hour of Code
In addition to supporting computer science courses, we can all help prepare our children for the 21st century by growing participation in this field, and to break the stereotype that coding is only for nerdy white teenage boys. The best way to do this is to have the entire school participate in the international [Hour of Code](http://hourofcode.com) movement. 

Please take action in our school to make sure our students have access to high quality computer science education. You can find information about Code.org's entire K-12 program and other options at <https://code.org/yourschool>.

Sincerely,

A parent

### Are you interested in learning and teaching computer science?
One approach is to work with Code.org, a national nonprofit, which offers [middle and high school curriculum](http://code.org/educate/curriculum) at no charge. They also have local regional partners that can help us with [resources and support for school and district administrators.](/administrators) 

### Apply now for Code.org's professional learning program
You don't need any background in computer science to get started. Code.org offers hands-on [professional learning workshops](/educate/professional-learning) across the country. You'll work with local art, history, math, English, history and other teachers to learn computer science and how to teach it. The majority of teachers who attend rank it the best professional development ever. 

The program also includes year-round support with quarterly 1-day workshops and online support for upcoming units. Our students would love to join you in our school's computer science class next year!

Applications for Code.org's middle and high school professional learning programs open winter/spring each year, but you can join the interest list any time of year. If you're interested you can [learn more and apply here](/educate/professional-learning).

And, to encourage girls and minorities in computer science, elementary school is the best time to start. Including computer science as part of the curriculum can inspire these students with lifelong skills and a interest to keep going in middle school and beyond.

 
### Will you help bring computer science to our classrooms?
 
We need to move beyond basic technology education and offer computer science to our students in elementary school. 

One approach is to partner with Code.org, a national nonprofit expanding access to computer science. They offer getting started [resources for schools and districts.](https://code.org/yourschool>)

### Fantastic Code.org curriculum and workshops for teachers (no cost)

We don't need to hire any new teachers. Our existing teachers can teach computer science once a week or every other week in their classes.

For elementary school teachers (Grades K-5), Code.org offers [high-quality curriculum and 1-day workshops](http://code.org/educate/k5) nationwide to prepare educators to introduce computer science basics in a format that's fun, accessible and relevant to the youngest learners. Students of all ages enjoy learning these fun and applicable skills.  Any elementary school teacher can sign up for the workshops - and both the curriculum and workshops are offered at no cost to our school. We can also contact their facilitators can come to our school for a PD day or a custom workshop for our teachers. Just see <http://code.org/k5>.
