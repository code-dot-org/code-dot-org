# Dig Deeper into AP Computer Science

The AP Computer Science exams are widely accepted by the computer science education community as one of the most reliable measures of high school computer science course-taking patterns. The College Board’s rigorous methodology and data gathering has enabled us to see trends in AP Computer Science A exam-taking over time, by state, by gender, and by ethnic group; as well as the impact of AP Computer Science Principles course, which launched in the 2016-17 school year. This page contains a summary of that data.

This data comes directly from the public spreadsheets available on a per-state basis from the [College Board](https://research.collegeboard.org/programs/ap/data).

_Change in ethnic group categories: In 2016, the College Board changed the ethnic group categories that they report. Prior to 2016, we considered the following to be underrepresented minority groups: American Indian, Black, Mexican American, Puerto Rican, and Other Hispanic. After 2016, we considered the following categories: American Indian/Alaska Native, Black, Hispanic/Latino, and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander._

* CS A: 24% of exams were taken by female students. This is an increase of 0.5% from 2017.
* CS P: 32% of exams were taken by female students. This is an increase of 2% from 2017.

### Underrepresented minority student participation

For 2018 College Board data, we consider the following ethnic group categories to be underrepresented minorities: American Indian/Alaska Native, Black, Hispanic/Latino, and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander. (Other categories reported by the College Board are Asian, White, Two or more races, Other, and No response.) Note that until 2016, the College Board reported demographics using different categories; for those years, the following ethnic group categories are considered to be underrepresented minorities: American Indian, Black, Mexican American, Puerto Rican, and Other Hispanic. (Other ethnic categories reported by the College Board include Asian, White, Other, and Not stated.) The majority is defined as White and Asian students.

#### _Underrepresented minority students <strong>comprised a low percent of AP CS exams</strong>:_
* CS A: 16% of exams were taken by underrepresented minority students. This is the same percent as 2017. CS A is the 8th lowest rate of participation for any AP exam (calculus, physics and languages have lower rates) and 3rd lowest in AP STEM exams.
* CS P: 27% of exams were taken by underrepresented minority students. This is an increase of 1% from 2017. CS P is the 2nd highest rate of underrepresented minority students participation across STEM AP exams (Environmental Science is higher at 28%). Same as 2017.
* All CS Exams: 22% of all CS exams were taken by underrepresented minority students. This is an increase of 2% from 2017.

#### _Underrepresented minority student <strong>passing rate was lower than the students in the majority</strong>:_
* CS A: underrepresented minority student passing rate was 44% of exams (lower than the students in the majority by -28% and the same as 2017).
* CS P: underrepresented minority student passing rate was 50% of exams (-3% less than the percent passing in 2017, and lower than the students in the majority by -29%).
* All CS Exams: underrepresented minority student passing rate of exams was 48% (-28% as compared to the students in the majority).
