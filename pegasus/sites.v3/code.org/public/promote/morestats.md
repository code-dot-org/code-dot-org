## International K-12 computer science
We are interested in seeing what's happening in computer science education internationally. [This](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H171Mu2RKzD9Qvp38sjKu1vuXX524XqdHtUf0BFzpWI/edit?usp=sharing) crowd-sourced document tracks what we know about current policy and in-progress efforts.


## Outside resources

### K-12 education

- The [K-12 Computer Science Framework](https://k12cs.org/) provides a vision for computer science education for all students, including concepts and practices by grade band.
- The [Pre-College Computer Science Education: A Survey of the Field] (https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/pre-college-computer-science-education-report.pdf) report from Google reviews the current state of the research into computer science education.
- [Arkansas has seen a major boost in computer science enrollment and diversity](http://amppob.com/nearly-4000-arkansas-students-enrolled-in-computer-science-in-fall-15/). Arkansas passed a law requiring (and funding) every high school to teach computer science. Months later, Arkansas saw a 260% increase in total CS enrollment, a 300% increase among female students, and a 600% increase among African American female students. This shows the massive impact of state policy on CS, and helps our advocacy efforts in other states.
- [Low-income](http://ecs.force.com/studies/rstempg?id=a0r0g000009TLeI) or [underrepresented minority students](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dls3NzoU8AAASYB.jpg:large) are less likely than other demographic groups to attend a school that offers computer science.
- 74% of women working in computing were [exposed to computing in junior high](https://www.accenture.com/t20170417T030444Z__w__/us-en/_acnmedia/Accenture/next-gen-3/girls-who-code/Accenture-Cracking-The-Gender-Code-Report.pdfla=en).
- The [Computational Thinking for a Computational World report] (http://digitalpromise.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/dp-comp-thinking-v1r5.pdf) from Digital Promise describes the role of computational thinking and provides recommendations for expanding it in K-12.
- The [Closing the STEM Gap](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE1UMWz) report from Microsoft explores why girls and women lose interest in STEM subjects and careers, and suggests strategies to reverse the trend.

### Computing skills across all jobs

- Half of the highest paying jobs in America require you to know how to code, according to [this report](http://burning-glass.com/research/coding-skills/) by Burning Glass.
- [Twice as many Americans](http://ecs.force.com/studies/rstempg?id=a0r0g000009TLfB) use computing in their jobs than previously reported, and half of those are in non-STEM fields. Outside of STEM fields, 40% of those doing complex computing work are women.
- A quarter of all jobs are now "highly digitalized" and they're the highest paying quartile of jobs (up from 5% of jobs in 2002), according to a [Brookings report](https://www.brookings.edu/research/digitalization-and-the-american-workforce/).
- Computer science skills are [increasingly valued] (https://blogs.oracle.com/certification/five-job-categories-increasingly-requiring-computer-science-skills) in marketing and design jobs.

### Jobs in computing

- [Projections](http://www.naceweb.org/job-market/compensation/the-top-paid-majors-for-the-class-of-2018/) for the graduating college class of 2018 shows that computer science is still one of the top-paying college degrees, coming in just under engineering.
- On average, a computer science degree from ANY university earns a [significantly higher](http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21646220-it-depends-what-you-study-not-where) financial return on investment than an arts & humanities degree from even the best schools.
- 91% of open software jobs are [outside Silicon Valley](http://www.inc.com/salvador-rodriguez/act-software-developers-map.html), and [mid-tech jobs are increasing](https://qz.com/1212875/the-american-midwest-is-quickly-becoming-a-blue-collar-version-of-silicon-valley/) in the midwest.  
- BSA released a report on the [economic impact of software](http://softwareimpact.bsa.org/).

	- Parents in lower-income households and teachers at schools with a greater percentage of free- or reduced-lunch-eligible students are most likely to value formal computer science education.
	- Many students, parents, teachers and school administrators do not properly distinguish between computer science activities and general computer literacy.
	- Observations from students and parents suggest that TV and film media portrayals, as well as personal perceptions among students, parents and educators, often reflect stereotypes about people who engage in computer science.
- [Searching for Computer Science: Access and Barriers in US K-12 Education] (https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/searching-for-computer-science_report.pdf) (Year 1):
	- Only 25% of schools across the country in 2015 offer a computer science class that includes coding or programming.
	- 90% of parents believe that offering computer science is a good use of resources at their child's school.
	- Principals and superintendents from schools and districts that do not offer computer science learning opportunities are most likely to say the main reason their schools do not offer computer science is the limited time they have to devote to classes that are not tied to testing requirements and the low availability and budget for computer science teachers. Few principals and superintendents mention a lack of computer equipment and software as the main reason their schools do not offer computer science.
- [Trends in the State of Computer Science in US K-12 Schools](http://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/trends-in-the-state-of-computer-science-report.pdf) (Year 2)

	- 84% of parents, 71% of teachers, 66% of principals, and 65% of superintendents say that offering CS is more important than or just as important as required courses like math, science, history and English. Further, A majority of educators feel that students should be required to take computer science in schools when it is available (60% of teachers, 62% of principals and 56% of superintendents).
	- 93% of parents believe that offering computer science is a good use of resources at their child's school.
- [Computer Science Learning: Closing the Gap - Girls](http://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/computer-science-learning-closing-the-gap-girls-brief.pdf)
	- Girls are less likely to have learned computer science outside of school: 31% of girls who learned computer science did so online (vs. 44%) and 41% learned it on their own (vs 54% of boys).
- [Computer Science Learning: Closing the Gap - Black Students](http://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/computer-science-learning-closing-the-gap-black-brief.pdf)
	- Black (31%) middle and high school students are more likely to be very interested in learning CS than White students (21%).

- [Computer Science Learning: Closing the Gap - Hispanic Students](http://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/computer-science-learning-closing-the-gap-hispanic-brief.pdf)
	- Hispanic (35%) middle and high school students are more likely to be very interested in learning CS than White students (21%), yet fewer Hispanic students have high confidence that they could learn computer science (51%, compared to 56% of White and 68% of Black students).
	- 92% of Hispanic parents whose children haven't learned computer science want their children to learn it (vs. 84% of White parents).

	- 83% of parents and 64% of principals in rural and small towns believe offering computer science is more or equally as important as any required course.
	- Principals in rural and small town schools say the biggest obstacles to increasing access to K-12 computer science are the lack of teachers with the necessary skills and funding to prepare or hire teachers.
- [Encouraging Students Toward Computer Science Learning](http://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/encouraging-students-toward-computer-science-learning-brief.pdf)
	- Students who have been told by parents or teachers that they would be good at computer science are 2.5-3 times more likely to be interested in learning it in the future; yet boys are more likely than girls to have been told by teachers (39% vs. 26%) and parents (46% vs. 27%) that they would be good at computer science.
	- Boys and girls have a similar level of interest in learning CS at age 12; however, girls' interest in learning CS decreases between ages 12 and 14 (27% to 12%) while boys’ increases (30% to 47%).
- [State-level reports] (http://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/cs-edu-state-reports-2017.pdf): Combined data from both Year 1 and Year 2 that summarizes the status of computer science in 43 US states.
