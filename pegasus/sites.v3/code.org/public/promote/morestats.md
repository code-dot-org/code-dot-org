# Other Advocacy Materials

This page contains numerous resources to assist in advocacy. You can find links to some of our popular blog posts, related documents, studies, and resources outside of Code.org.  


## Code.org blog posts
### Miscellaneous

* [16% of all new wages](http://blog.code.org/post/143085018748/16-of-all-new-wages-in-the-us-are-in-computer) in the U.S. are in computing occupations.
* Americans' perceptions of computer science are [changing](http://blog.code.org/post/139445414968).
* Computer science jobs account for the majority of "skilled worker" [immigration](http://blog.code.org/post/116568172243/with-all-the-national-debate-on-immigration-i) (H1B Visas).
* What [percent of STEM](http://blog.code.org/post/89267280803/stem) should be Computer Science?
* Is learning computer science linked to [improved learning](http://blog.code.org/post/125429946375/cs-other-subjects)  in other subjects?


### Diversity

* Students who learn computer science in high school are   [6 times](http://blog.code.org/post/143007230537/computer-science-the-impact-of-k-12-on-university) more likely to major in it. Women: 10x more likely
* [Maryland makes a simple policy change to boost diversity in computer science](http://blog.code.org/post/121123281798/md) 
* Reporting on [our efforts](http://blog.code.org/post/98856300118/diversity) to increase diversity in computer science
* Code.org's [team diversity](http://blog.code.org/post/98703117328/codeorgs-team-diversity-putting-our-money-where): putting our money where our mouth is

### Momentum

* Seeing our impact: A [record year](http://blog.code.org/post/91961669383/ap-computer-science) for computer science (2013-2014)
* The Hour of Code [reached](http://blog.code.org/post/70175643054/stats) 15 million users in 7 days (2014)
* [15,000](http://blog.code.org/post/128786388333/15000-new-computer-science-teachers) new computer science teachers (2015)




## International K-12 computer science
We are interested in seeing what's happening in computer science education internationally. [This](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H171Mu2RKzD9Qvp38sjKu1vuXX524XqdHtUf0BFzpWI/edit?usp=sharing) crowd-sourced document tracks what we know about current policy and in-progress efforts. 


## Outside resources

- [Landscape of K-12 Computer Science Education in the U.S.](http://csedu.gallup.com/home.aspx): A series of reports  from Gallup, commissioned by Google, including "Images of Computer Science: Perceptions Among Students, Parents and Educators in the U.S." and "Searching for Computer Science: Access and Barriers in U.S. K-12 Education"
- On average, a computer science degree from ANY university earns a [significantly higher](http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21646220-it-depends-what-you-study-not-where) financial return on investment than an arts & humanities degree from even the best schools
- [Arkansas has seen a major boost in CS enrollment and diversity](http://amppob.com/nearly-4000-arkansas-students-enrolled-in-computer-science-in-fall-15/). This spring, Arkansas passed a law requiring (and funding) every high school to teach CS. Months later, Arkansas has seen a 260% increase in total CS enrollment, a 300% increase among females, and a 600% increase among African American females. This shows the massive impact of state policy on CS, and helps our advocacy efforts in other states.
- [Twice as many Americans](http://changetheequation.org/blog/hidden-half) use computing in their jobs than previously reported, and half of those are in non-STEM fields. Outside of STEM fields, 40% of those doing complex computing work are [women](http://changetheequation.org/blog/grid-uncounted-women-computing). 
- Change the Equation has a [summary](http://changetheequation.org/blog/talent-hidden-plain-sight-addressing-gaps-computer-science) of untapped minority talent in computing.
- [Americans believe](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/horizon-media-study-reveals-americans-prioritize-stem-subjects-over-the-arts-science-is-cool-coding-is-new-literacy-300154137.html) computer science is cool and one of the most important subjects of study in school. 
- For each new high-tech job in a city, five jobs outside of tech are [ultimately created](http://eml.berkeley.edu//~moretti/book.htm).
