# More Data and Talking Points for Advocacy

Do you need to create a slide deck or one-pager to advocate for computer science in your state or city? The blog posts and links below contain resources and statistics that you can use to make your own custom materials!

## Code.org Policy Resources
* See [state-by-state data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSntgonHS7gQ-QI7hcwNq0ssLt99IcwoUZMRZ2uksOkdxlvPi5yuY3GjdxzfELwaOZC4eZoLLnhsSxE/pubhtml) on our 9 model policies for computer science education.
* Code.org partnered with CSTA and ECEP to create the annual [State of Computer Science Education](https://advocacy.code.org/stateofcs) report on state-level policies that support equitable K-12 computer science education and an analysis of implementation and participation data. You can download the reports from 2017-2020. The 2020 report found that states who adopt more state computer science policies show greater gender diversity in AP computer science exam-taking.
* [Computer science and ESSA](http://code.org/files/CS_and_ESSA.pdf): Read our recommendations for how states can add computer science to their state ESSA plans.
* Download a [master slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SUGh9QdyXoXPepD1vC5YXRnicxp-th_yWX8dNM_vywc/edit?usp=sharing) that you can use to create your own presentations.

## Why study computer science? 
[Six different studies](https://medium.com/@codeorg/cs-helps-students-outperform-in-school-college-and-workplace-66dd64a69536) show that studying computer science helps students outperform in school and college. Details on each of the studies follow.

* Code.org classrooms with resourceful teachers see [higher scores on English, math, and science standardized tests](https://medium.com/@codeorg/code-org-resourceful-teachers-higher-student-achievement-8be1efdec06e).
* Learning computer science [may be linked to](http://codeorg.tumblr.com/post/125429946375/cs-other-subjects) improved learning in math: AP computer science students receive better AP calculus scores than similiarly-situated peers.
* Students who take AP Computer Science Principles are [12% more likely to enroll in college](https://medium.com/@codeorg/study-computer-science-students-much-more-likely-to-enroll-in-college-faca65b1476d) compared to similiarly-situated peers, and students who take any AP computer science course are 17% more likely to attend college. Further, students who take AP exams are [more likely to graduate 4-year college](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED519365.pdf), even when they don't pass the exam.
* Learning to code on CS Fundamentals [helps students learn executive/planning problem-solving skills](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360131520300099?via%3Dihub) better than regular math and science. 
* University students who studied computer science [outperformed in problem solving](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3328778.3366808) compared to students who studied other subjects (both STEM and non-STEM). 
* [Research shows](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60661-8) that language skills are more important than math skills in predicting student CS performance.

### Diversity in computer science

* We compiled and analyzed data on student participation in CS by race/ethnicity and gender (in Code.org's courses, in AP CS, and in bachelor's degrees earned in CS).

	- Parents in lower-income households and teachers at schools with a greater percentage of free- or reduced-lunch-eligible students are most likely to value formal computer science education.
	- Many students, parents, teachers and school administrators do not properly distinguish between computer science activities and general computer literacy.
	- Observations from students and parents suggest that TV and film media portrayals, as well as personal perceptions among students, parents and educators, often reflect stereotypes about people who engage in computer science.
- [Searching for Computer Science: Access and Barriers in US K-12 Education] (https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/searching-for-computer-science_report.pdf) (Year 1):

	- 90% of parents believe that offering computer science is a good use of resources at their child's school.
	- Principals and superintendents from schools and districts that do not offer computer science learning opportunities are most likely to say the main reason their schools do not offer computer science is the limited time they have to devote to classes that are not tied to testing requirements and the low availability and budget for computer science teachers. Few principals and superintendents mention a lack of computer equipment and software as the main reason their schools do not offer computer science.
- [Trends in the State of Computer Science in US K-12 Schools](http://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/trends-in-the-state-of-computer-science-report.pdf) (Year 2)

	- 83% of parents and 64% of principals in rural and small towns believe offering computer science is more or equally as important as any required course.
	- Principals in rural and small town schools say the biggest obstacles to increasing access to K-12 computer science are the lack of teachers with the necessary skills and funding to prepare or hire teachers.
- [Encouraging Students Toward Computer Science Learning](http://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/encouraging-students-toward-computer-science-learning-brief.pdf)
	- Students who have been told by parents or teachers that they would be good at computer science are 2.5-3 times more likely to be interested in learning it in the future; yet boys are more likely than girls to have been told by teachers (39% vs. 26%) and parents (46% vs. 27%) that they would be good at computer science.
	- Boys and girls have a similar level of interest in learning CS at age 12; however, girls' interest in learning CS decreases between ages 12 and 14 (27% to 12%) while boys’ increases (30% to 47%).
