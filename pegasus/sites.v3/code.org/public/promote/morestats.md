	- Parents in lower-income households and teachers at schools with a greater percentage of free- or
reduced-lunch-eligible students are most likely to value formal computer science education. 
	- Many students, parents, teachers and school administrators do not properly distinguish between
computer science activities and general computer literacy. 
	- Observations from students and parents suggest that TV and film media portrayals, as well as personal perceptions among students, parents and educators, often reflect stereotypes about people who
engage in computer science.
- [Searching for Computer Science: Access and Barriers in U.S. K-12 Education] (https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/searching-for-computer-science_report.pdf) (Year 1):

	- 90% of parents believe that offering computer science is a good use of resources at their child's school.
	- Principals and superintendents from schools and districts that do not offer computer science learning
opportunities are most likely to say the main reason their schools do not offer computer science is
the limited time they have to devote to classes that are not tied to testing requirements and the low
availability and budget for computer science teachers. Few principals and superintendents mention a lack of computer equipment and software as the main reason their schools do not offer computer science.
- [Trends in the State of Computer Science in U.S. K-12 Schools](http://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/trends-in-the-state-of-computer-science-report.pdf) (Year 2)

	- 84% of parents, 71% of teachers, 66% of principals, and 65% of superintendents say that offering CS is more important than or just as important as required courses like math, science, history and English. Further, A majority of educators feel that students should be required to take computer science in schools when it is available (60% of teachers, 62% of principals and 56% of superintendents).
	- 93% of parents believe that offering computer science is a good use of resources at their child's school, and 
- [Computer Science Learning: Closing the Gap - Girls](http://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/computer-science-learning-closing-the-gap-girls-brief.pdf)
	- Girls are less likely to have learned computer science outside of school: 31% of girls who learned computer science did so online (vs. 44%) and 41% learned it on their own (vs 54% of boys). 
- [Computer Science Learning: Closing the Gap - Black Students](http://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/computer-science-learning-closing-the-gap-black-brief.pdf)

	- 83% of parents and 64% of principals in rural and small towns believe offering computer science is more or equally as important as any required course.
	- Principals in rural and small town schools say the biggest obstacles to increasing access to K-12 computer science are the lack of teachers with the necessary skills and funding to prepare or hire teachers. 
- [Encouraging Students Toward Computer Science Learning](http://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/encouraging-students-toward-computer-science-learning-brief.pdf)
	- Students who have been told by parents or teachers that they would be good at computer science are 2.5-3 times more likely to be interested in learning it in the future; yet boys are more likely than girls to have been told by teachers (39% vs. 26%) and parents (46% vs. 27%) that they would be good at computer science. 
	- Boys and girls have a similar level of interest in learning CS at age 12; however, girls' interest in learning CS decreases between ages 12 and 14 (27% to 12%) while boys’ increases (30% to 47%).
