# Make Your Own Advocacy Materials

Do you need to create a slide deck or one-pager to advocate for computer science in your state or city? The blog posts and links below contain resources and statistics that you can use to make your own custom materials! 


## Code.org blog posts
### Why computer science?

* Computing occupations are the [#1 source of new wages](http://codeorg.tumblr.com/post/144206906013/computing-occupations-are-now-the-1-source-of-new) in America (that's [16%](http://codeorg.tumblr.com/post/143085018748/16-of-all-new-wages-in-the-us-are-in-computer) of all new wages).
* The majority of Americans [want schools to teach computer science](http://codeorg.tumblr.com/post/139445414968).
* [More high school students](http://codeorg.tumblr.com/post/145705852158/the-class-students-like-the-most) like computer science classes than other academic subjects.
* Computer science jobs account for the majority of "skilled worker" [immigration](http://codeorg.tumblr.com/post/116568172243/with-all-the-national-debate-on-immigration-i) (H1B Visas).
* Computer science accounts for [the majority of new STEM jobs] (http://codeorg.tumblr.com/post/89267280803/stem).
* Learning computer science [may be linked to](http://codeorg.tumblr.com/post/125429946375/cs-other-subjects) improved learning in math.
* Computer science counts as a core requirement in [95% of BS degrees](https://medium.com/@codeorg/uc-data-confirms-computer-science-is-foundational-e8eb44038e48#.o0jvaeesg) in the University of California system.

### Diversity in computer science

* Women who learn computer science in high school are   [10 times](http://codeorg.tumblr.com/post/143007230537/computer-science-the-impact-of-k-12-on-university) more likely to study it in university.
* When CS counts for graduation, [diversity increases] (https://medium.com/@codeorg/does-making-cs-count-make-a-difference-7ab5ca6b8407). 
* 20% more high school girls like computer science [after an Hour of Code](https://medium.com/anybody-can-learn/study-shows-20-more-high-school-girls-like-computer-science-after-an-hour-of-code-2ebb704bf04). 
* Girls set AP Computer Science record: [skyrocketing growth](https://medium.com/@codeorg/girls-set-ap-computer-science-record-skyrocketing-growth-outpaces-boys-41b7c01373a5) outpaces boys. 
* [Maryland makes a simple policy change to boost diversity in computer science](http://codeorg.tumblr.com/post/121123281798/md). 
* Reporting on [our efforts](http://codeorg.tumblr.com/post/98856300118/diversity) to increase diversity in computer science (2014).
* [Representation of girls and underrepresented minorities in Code.org courses](https://medium.com/@codeorg/girls-and-underrepresented-minorities-are-represented-on-code-org-7fb32b7c4eba) (2017).
* Code.org's [team diversity](http://codeorg.tumblr.com/post/98703117328/codeorgs-team-diversity-putting-our-money-where): putting our money where our mouth is.


### Miscellaneous

* University computer science graduates [finally surpass](http://bit.ly/CS2003) the 2003 peak.
* AP Computer Science A is the [fastest-growing](http://codeorg.tumblr.com/post/150040749703/another-year-of-record-growth-for-ap-computer) AP course of the decade. 
* Code.org [updated our position](http://codeorg.tumblr.com/post/154518222573/computer-science-really-is-computer-science) on [Making Computer Science Count](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ksKYCmYVK7cNS6Pfc7OL9Cre2SsFsWWTyvW7faPPIZc/edit?usp=sharing).


## Other Code.org Resources
* See [state-by-state data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YtTVcpQXoZz0IchihwGOihaCNeqCz2HyLwaXYpyb2SQ/pubhtml) on our 9 model policies for computer science education.
* Code.org partnered with MassCAN, EDC, ECEP, SageFox, and ECS to create the [State of the States Landscape Report](http://code.org/files/State_of_the_states.pdf) on state-level policies that support equitable K-12 computer science education.


## International K-12 computer science
We are interested in seeing what's happening in computer science education internationally. [This](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H171Mu2RKzD9Qvp38sjKu1vuXX524XqdHtUf0BFzpWI/edit?usp=sharing) crowd-sourced document tracks what we know about current policy and in-progress efforts. 


## Outside resources

- The [K-12 Computer Science Framework](https://k12cs.org/) provides a vision for computer science education for all students, including concepts and practices by grade band. 
- [Landscape of K-12 Computer Science Education in the U.S.](http://csedu.gallup.com/home.aspx): A series of reports  from Gallup, commissioned by Google, including "Images of Computer Science: Perceptions Among Students, Parents and Educators in the U.S." and "Searching for Computer Science: Access and Barriers in U.S. K-12 Education."
- [Arkansas has seen a major boost in CS enrollment and diversity](http://amppob.com/nearly-4000-arkansas-students-enrolled-in-computer-science-in-fall-15/). Arkansas passed a law requiring (and funding) every high school to teach CS. Months later, Arkansas saw a 260% increase in total CS enrollment, a 300% increase among females, and a 600% increase among African American females. This shows the massive impact of state policy on CS, and helps our advocacy efforts in other states.
- Low-income or underrepresented minority students are [less likely](http://changetheequation.org/blog/new-data-bridging-computer-science-access-gap-0) than other demographic groups to attend a school that offers computer science. 
- [Half of the highest paying jobs](https://heatst.com/biz/half-of-the-highest-paying-jobs-in-america-now-require-you-to-know-how-to-code/) in America require you to know how to code. More information can be found in [the report](http://burning-glass.com/research/coding-skills/) by Burning Glass.
- On average, a computer science degree from ANY university earns a [significantly higher](http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21646220-it-depends-what-you-study-not-where) financial return on investment than an arts & humanities degree from even the best schools.
- [Twice as many Americans](http://changetheequation.org/blog/hidden-half) use computing in their jobs than previously reported, and half of those are in non-STEM fields. Outside of STEM fields, 40% of those doing complex computing work are [women](http://changetheequation.org/blog/grid-uncounted-women-computing). 
- A [new report](http://www.sreb.org/sites/main/files/file-attachments/cs_commission_2016_0.pdf) by the SREB recommends 5 policy actions states can take to expand access to computer science education.
- A [report](http://www.ecs.org/ec-content/uploads/09.13.2016_Computer-Science-in-High-School-Graduation-Requirements.pdf) by the Education Commission of the States provides details on computer science in high school graduation requirements.  
- 91% of open software jobs are [outside Silicon Valley](http://www.inc.com/salvador-rodriguez/act-software-developers-map.html). 
- BSA released a report on the [economic impact of software](http://softwareimpact.bsa.org/). 
- Change the Equation has a [summary](http://changetheequation.org/blog/talent-hidden-plain-sight-addressing-gaps-computer-science) of untapped minority talent in computing.
- [Americans believe](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/horizon-media-study-reveals-americans-prioritize-stem-subjects-over-the-arts-science-is-cool-coding-is-new-literacy-300154137.html) computer science is cool and one of the most important subjects of study in school. 
- For each new high-tech job in a city, five jobs outside of tech are [ultimately created](http://eml.berkeley.edu//~moretti/book.htm).
