# Saving Progress in Computer Science Fundamentals (December 3 - 11)

### For students
This week, millions of students are trying computer science for the Hour of Code. With so many students at the same time, our systems are overloaded!  This means we can’t save progress and mark the bubbles green as you solve new puzzles. Don’t worry - all your green bubbles and progress from before this week are still stored. You can’t see it now, but it will go back to normal next week. 


Ask your teacher if you should be working on something else this week instead.

### For teachers
Part of Code.org’s mission is to remove the obstacles that keep students all over the world from the opportunity to learn computer science. That’s why we offer tools, curriculum, and resources for teachers at no cost. We’re also thrilled that we’ve been able to introduce millions of students to computer science through the Hour of Code campaign. During Computer Science Education Week this year, our servers will be overloaded again as organizers across the globe lead their classrooms through activities.


It’s an exciting time of year, but our servers can’t handle it! We can’t store progress for this many students simultaneously.

**Due to this, we unfortunately will not be saving or reporting student progress on Course 1-4, our Accelerated Course or the Hour of Code tutorials from December 3-11.**

Given that your students have already gone beyond an Hour of Code, Computer Science Education Week provides an excellent opportunity for them to explore activities outside their normal curriculum. Here are some ideas teachers have recommended for great ways your classroom can celebrate the Hour of Code without student progress functionality:

**Try an Hour of Code with a new tool or activity**<br/>
Curriculum providers have created over 200 different activities you can do with your classroom.  You can find all the activities at [https://code.org/learn](https://code.org/learn). Encourage your students to try something different and new this week: learn to make music with code, build their own game or app, or solve interesting puzzles. All the activities are free and don’t require any sign up. You can also use any of Code.org’s Hour of Code activities and print out certificates your students can take home. (We just won’t be able to track your student’s progress in their summary view or your teacher dashboard.)

**Do an “unplugged” activity with your classroom**<br/>
Want to keep making progress on the Computer Science Fundamentals curriculum? The courses have dozens of [unplugged activities](https://code.org/curriculum/unplugged) that allow you to help students transfer their learning on the computer to real life activities.

Note, the middle school, high school, and teacher professional learning courses and resources on our site will save progress throughout the Hour of Code. These courses are lower volume and don’t create the same scale problems on our servers.

Thank you so much for leading the K–12 computer science movement in the US.  If you have any questions, please contact us at [http://code.org/contact](http://code.org/contact).
