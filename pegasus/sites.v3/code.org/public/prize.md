    <h2>Expand computer science at your school, win $10,000</h2>
    <p>To help more students access computer science (CS), especially students from underserved communities, we're partnering with DonorsChoose to award $1 million to U.S. schools — that’s right, a MILLION dollars. This CS Education Week, one middle and high school in every U.S. state and D.C. will be awarded the CS Leaders Prize of $10,000 to help establish computer science education for their students.</p>
