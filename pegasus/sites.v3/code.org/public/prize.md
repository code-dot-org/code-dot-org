    <h2>Schools win $10,000 for expanding computer science access</h2>
    <p>As part of the 10th Hour of Code, we partnered with DonorsChoose to award $1 million to U.S. schools to help more students get access to computer science — that’s right, a MILLION dollars.</p>
    <p>We wanted to recognize the schools who are working hard to recover from the challenges that our education system has gone through over the past two years and support their goals to establish or expand access to computer science not only for students in their own classrooms, but also in their districts.</p>

## Congratulations to the winners of the CS Leaders Prize!

102 winning schools have each been awarded the CS Leaders Prize of $10,000 to help establish computer science education for their students! These schools are all adding a new computer science course in the 2023–2024 school year. This will impact more than 55,000 students, many in underserved areas. The winning schools will also work within their districts to impact many more students in other schools in the coming years.
