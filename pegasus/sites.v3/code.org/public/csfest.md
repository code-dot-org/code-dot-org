## Join Ciara and Russell Wilson for a celebration of computer science on April 2

CSFest will bring together high school computer science students from Seattle area schools to celebrate the young adults who are learning this important 21st century subject and to help them imagine their future in computer science.

Although our whole world runs on technology, most schools don't teach computer science, and most students don't take the class. Young women and students of color are especially missing an opportunity to participate as creators in our increasingly digital society.

If you're learning computer science in Seattle high schools, we can't wait to see you on April 2. If you're outside Seattle, please consider taking a class in coding or computer science, to learn this foundational subject.

If your school doesn't teach computer science, [nominate a teacher](https://code.org/nominate) for a scholarship to learn how, because every student in every school should have this opportunity.

**Puget Sound teachers:** even if your school doesn’t offer computer science, you can still attend! Apply to the [Code.org Progressional Learning program.](https://code.org/educate/professional-learning/middle-high) Middle school and high school teachers who are participating in our 2020-21 Professional Learning program are invited to this exclusive event!

### **More event details**
The celebration will be held on the morning of April 2. Location information will be shared directly with schools. Lunch will be provided.

The main event on stage features Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson, award-winning singer-songwriter Ciara, members of Amazon's leadership team, and Code.org CEO Hadi Partovi. In addition, the celebration will also feature a career fair of local technology companies that offer job opportunities in computer science, and a university fair of local computer science learning opportunities for high school graduates.

### **How do I know if my school is participating?**
High school computer science classrooms from the Seattle, Highline, Federal Way, and Shoreline school districts are invited, as well as a handful of schools from the greater Puget Sound Area. A list of participating schools will be updated on this page below as they are confirmed.

If you are a computer science teacher or administrator at one of the high schools that teach computer science in these districts and have not yet talked to us, please contact us to confirm your school’s participation and logistical details.

If you’re a middle school or high school teacher in Puget Sound and your school doesn’t teach computer science, apply to the [Code.org Progressional Learning](https://code.org/educate/professional-learning) program to attend as an individual.

### **What if my school doesn’t teach computer science?**
If your school doesn't teach computer science, [nominate a teacher for a scholarship](https://code.org/nominate) to learn how, because every student in every school should have this opportunity.
