# CSFest has been postponed

We are sad to announce that out of an abundance of caution, we will be postponing the April 4 CSFest event.

 The health and safety of students, teachers and their families is extremely important to us. We are monitoring news about the Covid-19 daily, and in light of the recommendations from [King County Public Health](https://kingcounty.gov/depts/health/communicable-diseases/disease-control/novel-coronavirus.aspx), we have decided to err on the side of caution and postpone the event.

This was not an easy decision to make, and we do not have a new date for the event. We appreciate the excitement and eagerness that districts, administrators and teachers have shown us in trying to make this an amazing celebration for students, and we thank everyone for their understanding and patience. The health and safety of our community comes first, and we look forward to working with schools and districts in the future to make this a wonderful celebration of computer science!
