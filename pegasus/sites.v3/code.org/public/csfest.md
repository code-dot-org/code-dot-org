## Join Ciara and Russell Wilson for a celebration of computer science on April 2

CSFest will bring together computer science students from Seattle-area schools to celebrate the young adults who are learning this important 21st century subject and to help them imagine their future in computer science.

Although our whole world runs on technology, most schools don't teach computer science, and most students don't have the opportunity to take computer science classes. Young women and students of color in particular are missing opportunities to participate as creators in our increasingly digital society.

If you're learning computer science in Seattle high schools, we can't wait to see you on April 2. If you're outside Seattle, please consider taking a computer science class to learn this foundational subject.

If your school doesn't teach computer science, [nominate a teacher](https://code.org/nominate) for a scholarship to learn how, because every student in every school should have this opportunity.

**Puget Sound teachers:** even if your school doesn’t offer computer science, you can still attend! Apply to the [Code.org Progressional Learning program.](https://code.org/educate/professional-learning/middle-high) Middle school and high school teachers who are participating in our 2020-21 Professional Learning program are invited to this exclusive event!

### **More event details**
The celebration will be held on the morning of April 2 in downtown Seattle. Location information will be shared directly with schools. Lunch will be provided.

The main event on stage features Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson, award-winning singer-songwriter Ciara, members of Amazon's leadership team, and Code.org CEO Hadi Partovi. In addition, the celebration will also feature a career fair of local technology companies that offer job opportunities in computer science, and a university fair of local computer science learning opportunities for high school graduates.

### **Confirm your attendance by March 5th**
Invited schools must RSVP to this event no later than **March 5th**. The number of attendees from your school may be limited due to space. Note: If you were invited, you were sent an **RSVP password via email**.
