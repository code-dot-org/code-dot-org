A letter from Briana Morrison, Assistant Professor University of Nebraska Omaha

Dear Code.org CSP Teachers,

THANK YOU again for your continued interest in participating in the Subgoal Research Study. By participating in this study, you are helping Code.org to improve its resources for teachers like you and students like yours, and you are helping us to know more about how people learn computing. Thank you! This message will tell you what to expect as your class works through Unit 3.

This document is kind of long but contains all the info you need to get going with the study.  You can find and bookmark a copy of this at: code.org/research/subgoal-labels-study/letter

Ready to Go?
This email is primarily to let you know what to expect as you go through Unit 3 as part of the subgoals research study. At some point during the semester, we will also ask you complete a 5-minute questionnaire about your class. The questionnaire will come with a consent form that tells you how your responses will be used for research. It will not ask you for any identifying information, so your responses cannot be traced back to you. It will also only ask you for aggregate data about your students (e.g., what percentage of your students are female), no questions involving individual data about your students will be asked. While some of this data may already be collected by Code.org, we will use your responses to help calculate response rate errors as not all students self-report data.

If you would like to opt-out at this point or if you have questions, please contact Baker Franke (Code.org research and evaluation manager) through research@code.org.  You should also feel free to contact us, the researchers, ourselves. We’d be more than happy to answer your questions about the study, subgoals, or hear any suggestions that you have. Our contact info is at the bottom of this message. 

Thank you again for your participation in the research study.

Do this: Activate the Subgoals version of Unit 3!
When you “turn on” the research version of CSP Unit 3 it effectively swaps out the original version of unit 3 for the research version.  

Here’s how to enable it:

Log in to code studio with the account you use to teach


Once logged in, activate the research version of the study for you and your students by clicking this link:

https://studio.code.org/experiments/set_course_experiment/subgoals

After doing so you will see a green banner verifying that You have successfully joined the experiment ‘subgoals’.



Double-check. Verify that you see the subgoals version of unit 3

The green verification banner should be on your teacher dashboard page.  Scroll down and click the Edit button for one of you CSP sections.

In the Edit Section Details dialog make sure the course is set to Computer Science Principles.  In the Select Current Unit: verify in the pulldown menu that Unit 3 now says Unit 3: Intro Programming (Subgoals).

Note: it may take up to 60 seconds from the time you clicked the activation link for the subgoals version of unit 3 to show in pulldown menu. If you don’t see it at first, give it a minute, refresh the page and try again.
 
Assign it to your class when ready
	
You do not need to set Unit 3 as the current unit at this time and should not assign until October 20 or after (see below). This step is only to verify that you are enrolled in the research version of Unit 3.  Set it to the current unit when you are ready to start unit 3, and it will make the research version of Unit 3 appear for your students.

What you and your students will see

Once you have activated the subgoals version of Unit 3, it means that all of the typical navigation flows will direct your students to the subgoals version of Unit 3. In most places you and your students will only see references to “Unit 3” with no explicit mention of the subgoals study.  However, there are few signs you can look out for.

How do you know if you’re in the right place?
The research version of Unit 3 has a different URL from the original version.  To verify that you or your students are working in the right version, just glance at the URL on the top of the screen.  

The research study URLs take the form  …/csp3-research-abcxyz/…  where the abcxyz is going to be six random alpha-numeric characters (this is indented to make the url hard to guess for those not involved in the study):

As long as you see a URL of that form, you and your students are in the right place.

Starting with Lesson 4, the students will be introduced to some new vocabulary (subgoals) along with the specific comment-style blocks that are associated with each subgoal. 

For a definition of a subgoal, look at Lesson 4.1, and you’ll see “subgoal” in the Vocab section. You’ll also see that the new blocks are organized based on the subgoal that they achieve. 

In Lesson 4.3, your students will see a puzzle that shows them how to use the subgoal comment-style blocks. In the early levels (bubbles), subgoals will be pre-populated in the workspace. 

Your students will also occasionally see a “Goals” pallette in the coding toolbox.  They will be instructed how to use these as part of the course.  The subgoals are draggable comment blocks. Starting with Lesson 4.6, students will start dragging subgoals to the workspace. 

There will be a couple of new levels sprinkled throughout the unit that further explain subgoals and how to use them to solve problems. There will also be a couple of new assessment levels to measure the impact of subgoals on student knowledge and performance. We do not expect that these additions will significantly impact the time that your students will spend on Unit 3.

Starting before October 20?

The subgoals version of unit 3 will not be officially ready until October 20.  However, we are finalizing the lessons in order, so earlier lessons should be done a little before Oct. 20.  Note that the first lesson addressing subgoals is lesson 4 of the unit -- you can start the unplugged algorithms lessons earlier if you like.

If you want to start earlier please email research@code.org to verify what is in place and ready to go.  Please don’t assign the unit to a section before Oct. 20 without checking first.  You can track progress of development without assigning the unit by visiting the URL directly  https://studio.code.org/s/csp3-research-mxghyt/

Please respect the fact that we are exposing the subgoals version of unit 3 slightly ahead of time so you can take a look at what’s there now to get a lay of land, but the unit will not necessarily be stable. You should expect to see changes to the unit leading up to Oct. 20. 

If you have questions or suggestions while looking please contact us (see below).

Answers to other questions about joining the study

Are there any new lesson plans?

No. The goals and objectives of each lesson remain the same as the original version so preparing from the original lessons plans (on curriculum.code.org/csp/unit3) is all that is necessary.  However, you should know that the digital lesson plans WILL NOT reference subgoal levels.  Rather, they will still show the original set of levels in the “Code Studio Levels” section of the lesson plan. For the most part the sequence of student tasks remains the same, there will just be some additional subgoals support layered in.  For planning you should look at the actual levels on code studio.

What if I’ve already started “original” Unit 3 with my students? 

Student work isn’t lost, but you have to directly go to the original URL to see it, and your teacher dashboard will only show progress for the subgoals version of unit 3. 

Once you activate the subgoals version of Unit 3 it effectively switches you and any of your CSP students to using the subgoals version with a clean slate. Any student work in original unit 3 is preserved and students can see their work by entering the original unit 3 url directly:  https://studio.code.org/s/csp3  From there they can revisit any code, and even copy/paste into the subgoals version if they like.
 
As the teacher your teacher dashboard will always show student progress for the subgoals version only (unless you opt-out of the study, in which case you go back to using original unit 3).  If you need to look at student work that had been done previously in the original version of unit 3, you can visit the level directly via url at https://studio.code.org/s/csp3 and use the blue “teacher tray” to find an individual student’s work.

Can I talk about this study with other CSP teachers?

No.  To maintain the integrity of the research study please do not discuss anything about subgoals with other CSP teachers in person, or on the forums.   Once we are confident that everyone in the study group is done with Unit 3 we’ll let you know and you can discuss freely after that point.

Please remember that if you are participating in Code.org Professional Development (PD) this year, please DO NOT talk about subgoal labels during any PD sessions or on the forums. The PD agenda for the non-subgoal version of Unit 3 is still good preparation to teach the unit. The PD facilitators are aware the study is going on (many are participating themselves).


How should I Communicate Bugs and Errors?

If you come across any bugs or errors while your students are working in the new subgoal Unit 3, please contact Briana Morrison (bbmorrison@unomaha.edu) directly.  Please communicate the exact lesson containing the error (lesson number, bubble number), what the error is, and whether more than one student is having the error. You should also indicate if the error is preventing students from continuing to the next lesson. Feel free to communicate suggestions on making lessons better as well!  

Note on privacy: presently the participant contact list is completely hidden from the research team.  While emailing Briana Morrison directly will expose your email address and name to her, she will never have access to data that allows her to tie that email address to you or your students’ activity on code studio. You can email her from a different account than your code studio account as well.  It doesn’t matter.  Your relative anonymity will be preserved.  We encourage you to contact her directly for quick action and response.  However, if you are not comfortable emailing her directly you can always send email to research@code.org and put “Subgoals” somewhere in the subject.  Those emails go directly to Baker Franke at Code.org who will route the message to Briana on your behalf.

Data, your privacy, and security

Code.org is acting as a third party data collector and implementation partner for this study.  Part of our agreement with Code.org is that we will never be able to identify you or your students. Specifically:

Your email address will never be shared with us – all communication will come through Code.org’s email system (like this letter), though you are free to contact us if you like.
We will only get de-identified data back from Code.org. We will not know whose students belong to whom or in any way be able to identify the teacher of those students.
 As a further protection Code.org will not share data about students where there is a risk of identification such as classrooms with very few (typically < 5) students.
 The data being shared with us is primarily student responses to multi-choice assessment questions and textual analysis of student code (namely, looking for subgoal labels).  Code.org will not share any student code with us, or any free-response text submitted by students as it may contain personally identifiable info. 
Code.org will also share aggregated code studio activity data so that we can chart the entire study group’s progress through the unit.
  


THANK YOU again, for your continued interest in participating in the Subgoal Research Study.
