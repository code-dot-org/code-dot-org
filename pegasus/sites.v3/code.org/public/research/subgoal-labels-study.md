# Invitation: Subgoal Labels Study

## CS Principles teachers -- we want YOU to join us
* Teachers who use Code.org Computer Science Principles curriculum are invited to participate in a research study * The curriculum team at Code.org have partnered with researchers to create a version of **Unit 3 of the CSP curriculum that uses a learning mechanism called "subgoal labels"** 
* **Subgoal labels** have been shown to be an effective method for novices learning computer programming.  
* If you would like to try this version of the unit please consider participating in the study that will help us verify the method really works! [<button>Excited? Click here to participate in the Subgoal Labels Study</button>](https://studio.code.org/s/subgoal-labels-opt-in/stage/1/puzzle/1)

## Benefits for your students:
Besides helping inform best practices in computer science education, **your participation may improve your students’ performance**.  In preliminary research in computing classes, students who learn using subgoal labels have been shown to:
* Perform 10-15% better on problem solving tasks (this is the equivalent of a letter grade on a test)
* Retain more knowledge over time
* Because of more efficient learning, complete problem solving tasks in less time

Prior research across a variety of disciplines such as statistics, algebra and chemistry suggests that using *subgoal labels* improves students’ problem solving abilities by helping to break down problems into manageable parts. 
By participating you can help to verify these initial results with a wide range of students.

[Sign me up! I want to participate in the Subgoal Labels study](https://studio.code.org/s/subgoal-labels-opt-in/stage/1/puzzle/1)## What will you have to do to participate?Very little! 
* **There is NO different** or additional teacher prep required - if you prepped for Unit 3 already, fantastic.
* **There is NO difference** in the Unit 3 structure, lesson sequence, learning objectives, or projects
* The *only* differences students will see are (1) how some material is presented to them through the App Lab programming environment (2) some assessment questionsYou may be asked to provide feedback on how you perceive your students are doing with unit 3, and we may ask you additional demographic data about your class.

## How does the study work?

Code.org, in collaboration with the researchers, are conducting a scientific study about how effective subgoal labels are for students learning how to program.
* For teachers who opt in to participate in the study, a number of those teachers will be randomly selected to receive the subgoal "intervention". Others will receive a redesigned version of the unit without the intervention. This type of blind experiment is important for scientific rigor. 
* All students in all your classes will see the same thing – your students won’t be split between different versions of the study. 
* Your students will be automatically routed to a "research" version of CSP Unit 3 which will have a different URL that might look something like https://studio.code.org/s/csp3-research-MXGHYT.
* Simply follow along with that version of unit 3, and that's it!## Data collection and protection
* Code.org does not store student contact information on its servers. All student activity data collected by Code.org is **anonymized** with randomly generated student and teacher IDs and further stripped of any identifying information before sharing it for research purposes. * Results will **never** be tied back to any individual student, teacher or school.  
* Any data collected directly by the researchers will have **no identifying information** 
* The researchers will **never have direct access to any student generated data** – only aggregated data prepared and cleaned by Code.org. An example of this might be how many students per class get a specific question correct on the first try. While data might be aggregated and generalized based on class groupings, there will be no way to know the identity of a student who got the question right or wrong, nor the identity of the class they were part of, nor the identity of their teacher.
## The Researchers:
