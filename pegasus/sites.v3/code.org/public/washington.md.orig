Dear Chairpersons Hunter and Hill,


Thank you for your leadership on the important issue of computer science education in Washington.

We the undersigned business executives, educators and nonprofit leaders enthusiastically support passing and funding House Bill 1813 to expand access to computer science in Washington’s K-12 public schools. 

It was in Washington that Microsoft led the world in establishing a market for personal computers, and our state is now home to dozens of public tech companies — from Amazon to Zulily — and countless startups. Washington is the first state where Silicon Valley companies such as Google, Apple, Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Salesforce expand to grow their engineering workforce, bringing jobs to our region. 

In 36 states, the most common jobs are truck drivers, farmers or secretaries. In Washington, the most common jobs are software developers. These jobs aren’t only in tech &mdash; in fact two-thirds of the nation’s computing jobs are in other industries, at places like Starbucks, Boeing, Nordstrom, Costco or WSDOT. 

But we’re not doing enough to prepare our students for these opportunities. There are currently 20,000 open computing jobs across all industries in Washington, and these jobs are growing at three times the state average. In 2014, there were only 1,200 computer science graduates at the university level, and among high school AP Computer Science test takers, only 260 were female. Only 48 were black or Hispanic. We compare that to 20,000 open jobs and wonder: why is this course only offered in 7 percent of our high schools?

Besides the jobs, computer science is foundational for all students. Every student learns about photosynthesis and electricity, without pursuing careers as botanists or electricians. For today’s students, it’s equally relevant to know what an algorithm is or how the Internet works.

<<<<<<< HEAD
House Bill 1813 offers a comprehensive solution: it establishes education standards for computer science and matches private funding to train teachers, who are critical to expanding access to this field — and prioritizes investments to reach underrepresented students first. Nine out of ten Washington voters support these proposals. We encourage you to commit $1 million per year to support the computer science education grant program. The 1:1 private match requirement means your investment would be doubled, enabling every Washington school to teach computer science by 2025.

Many of the undersigned have donated significant funds to support computer science education. Matched with your commitment, let’s give a united answer to the parent who asks, “Why doesn’t my child’s school teach computer science?”

Signed, 

<br />
