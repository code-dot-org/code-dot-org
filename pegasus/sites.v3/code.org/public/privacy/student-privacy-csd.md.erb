# Code.org courses in Computer Science

## Bringing computer science into our classroom

In today’s world where software and technology are everywhere - in our computers, pockets, cars, and homes - computer science has become essential for a strong educational foundation, but unfortunately most schools don’t teach it. So, we’re proud and excited to introduce some of the basics of computer science into your child’s classroom this year using Code.org! 

Regardless of who they are, where they come from, or what careers or opportunities they pursue in the future, students will be better prepared and informed citizens of the digital age by learning computer science. Encourage your child as they take the course, helping them to get beyond CS stereotypes and feel empowered. Students of color and female students are among underrepresented groups in this field of study and can especially benefit from your encouragement!

## What is Code.org?

Code.org offers a fun, creative platform for learning basic coding and computer science! Using a blended learning model, Computer Science Fundamentals courses blend online and "unplugged" non-computer activities to teach students computational thinking, problem solving, programming concepts and digital citizenship.

Most importantly, students will learn skills that extend beyond CS and have a blast doing it! Research shows that students give computer science and the arts the highest ratings out of all their subjects. [View more stats about CS.](/stats)
 
### Students will study topics such as:
- Impacts of computing and digital citizenship
- Logic, problem solving and creativity
- How the Internet and computers work
- Basic computer programming
- Creating simple apps, animations, and “code art”

### Student login - for access outside the classroom 
For our classroom to participate in this course, we have created Code.org accounts for each student. Because the coursework is done online on the Code.org platform, students can log in from outside the classroom - from a computer or tablet at home, or in the library.
 
Students are disappointed when class ends while they’re still working on their Code.org projects, so encourage your child to log on and nurture that budding interest in computer science. Make screen time about creating, not consuming.

## Protecting student privacy
Code.org assigns utmost importance to student safety and security.  Code.org has signed the [Student Privacy Pledge](https://studentprivacypledge.org/signatories/) and their privacy practices have received [one of the highest overall scores from Common Sense Media](https://medium.com/@codeorg/code-orgs-commitment-to-student-privacy-earns-accolades-cae1cca35632). Personal information is kept secure and is never sold or shared.
The list below summarizes what student data is stored and protected by Code.org, and how it is used. You can find further details by viewing Code.org’s [Privacy Policy](https://code.org/privacy).

### Data that Code.org collects from students participating in the course:
- Student display name (e.g. “John S” or “Cool coder”) - Display names are not necessarily real names.
- Age (to protect the privacy of the youngest learners)
- Progress in the course (to display reports for students and teachers)
- Login date/time and other technical information (for debugging purposes)

### Data optionally or potentially stored:
- Scrambled “hash” of email address. If a student creates an account directly (without a parent or teacher), they will login using their email address, but Code.org will never receive the actual email address, only a scrambled “hash” that can’t be converted back to the original.
- Parent email address if parent creates the child’s account
- Gender or race (to anonymously summarize aggregate participation in computer science, to track progress towards increasing diversity in the field).
- Student projects created in course progression or standalone.
- Student-uploaded images, sounds, or videos for their creations.
- Student-provided responses to surveys
