# Data Privacy Addendum

Code.org® is an education innovation nonprofit dedicated to the vision that every student in every school has the opportunity to learn computer science as part of their core K-12 education. We expand access to computer science in schools, with a focus on increasing participation by young women and students from other underrepresented groups.We provide high-quality K-12 [elementary, middle and high school](https://studio.code.org/courses) courses for any student or teacher under a creative commons no cost license.

We take students’ privacy very seriously. We [are transparent](/privacy) about what data we collect, why we collect it, and what we do with it if we have it. And Code.org has signed the [Student Privacy Pledge](https://studentprivacypledge.org/) to demonstrate our commitment to privacy.

We know that districts often seek to enter into Data Privacy Agreements with education providers. If you are a school administrator in a K-12 school in the United States that uses or wishes to use Code.org, then in addition to accepting our [Terms of Service](/tos) and [Privacy Policy](/privacy), you may choose to add this Student Data Privacy Addendum (DPA) to our agreement which is designed to address compliance with applicable laws and best privacy practices in the industry.
