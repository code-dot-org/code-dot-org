# Data Privacy Addendum - Montana

Code.org® is a nonprofit dedicated to expanding participation in computer science by making it available in more schools, and increasing participation by women and students from marginalized racial and ethnic groups underrepresented in computer science. We provide high-quality K-12 [elementary, middle and high school](https://studio.code.org/courses) courses for any student or teacher under a creative commons no cost licence.

We take students’ privacy very seriously. We [are transparent](/privacy) about what data we collect, why we collect it, and what we do with it if we have it. We’ve also [received top marks](https://privacy.commonsense.org/evaluation/code.org) from a Common Sense Media’s review of our [Privacy Policy](/privacy) and practices. And Code.org has signed the [Student Privacy Pledge](https://studentprivacypledge.org/) to demonstrate our commitment to privacy.

We know that districts often seek to enter into Data Privacy Agreements with education providers. If you are a school administrator in a K-12 school in Montana that uses or wishes to use Code.org, then in addition to accepting our [Terms of Service](/tos) and [Privacy Policy](/privacy), you may choose to add this Student Data Privacy Addendum (DPA) to our agreement. This DPA aligns with the provisions of the [National Data Privacy Agreement Template](https://privacy.a4l.org/national-dpa/) developed by the Student Data Privacy Consortium, and has been designed to address compliance with applicable laws, including the Montana Pupil Online Personal Information Protection Act (HB745).
