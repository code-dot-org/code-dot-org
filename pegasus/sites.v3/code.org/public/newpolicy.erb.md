## Congratulations Alabama, Maryland and Wisconsin!

In the last week, 3 U.S. states - [Alabama](http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2013/12/want_to_learn_computer_coding.html), Maryland and [Wisconsin](http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/viewart/20131211/GPG0101/312110246/State-high-school-students-will-need-more-math-science-credits) - all passed legislation to allow rigorous computer science courses to satisfy a math or science credit for high school graduation.

Thanks to your support and our advocacy, this legislative change means 6 U.S. states have changed policy to allow computer science courses to satisfy existing high school graduation requirements in 2013 alone. In states that do make computer science count, enrollment in computer science is higher (particularly among women and students of color), compared to the other states [(see this short document for more info)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4dp0kfdfdrke9e3/Code_CinC_state_one_pager_%28new%29.pdf).

### Please, share the news.

And help spread this change to all American schools by [signing our petition](http://code.org).
