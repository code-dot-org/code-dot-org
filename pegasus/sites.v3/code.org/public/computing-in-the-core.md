# Computing in the Core is now the Code.org Advocacy Coalition
Computing in the Core has merged with the [Code.org Advocacy Coalition](http://code.org/advocacy). 

The Code.org Advocacy Coalition continues Computing in the Core's work as a non-partisan group that believes computer science should be part of the core curriculum in education, and that we must increase participation and access for girls and underrepresented students of color. It shares the same principles, recommendations and goals as Computing in the Core did.

The founders of Computing in the Core -- Association for Computing Machinery, Computer Science Teachers Association, Microsoft, Google, National Center for Women and Information Technology, SAS, Computing Research Association, Anita Borg Institute -- are all members of Code.org's Advocacy Coalition. A huge thanks goes out to these members for their leadership and support in elevating the discussion of K-12 computer science.

Please visit the [Code.org Advocacy Coalition](http://code.org/advocacy) to view our list of partners and policy agenda. 

Thank you for supporting Computing in the Core. If you have questions, email us: [advocacy@code.org](mailto:advocacy@code.org).
