The Circuit Playground is family of small microcontroller boards with LEDs, buttons, and sensors built in. Designed specifically for novice programmers, the Circuit Playground enables students to get up and running quickly with physical computing without worrying about many of the traditional barriers to entry. Developed by our friends at <a href="//adafruit.com">Adafruit</a>, the Circuit Playground is the core tool used in <a href="//studio.code.org/s/csd6">CS Discoveries Unit 6, Physical Computing</a>.

<h2><a name="how"></a>Programming with the Circuit Playground</h2>

Code.org has developed a special set of commands for <a href="/applab/">App Lab</a>, our block-to-text app development environment, called the Maker Toolkit. Using App Lab and the Maker Toolkit, students can quickly build apps that communicate with external hardware using the same language and environment they've already become comfortable with.

## <a name="requirements"></a>Software Requirements

One of our primary goals in integrating the Circuit Playground into CS Discoveries is to reduce the barriers that teachers often encounter attempting to teach physical computing. To that end, we've developed a system that requires only minimal software installation and wide platform compatibility. If using Chromebooks, we've provided a browser extension to install. For all other platforms, we've created a standalone app that allows the programming tools on our website to communicate with the Circuit Playground over USB. Visit the [Maker Toolkit setup page](//studio.code.org/maker/setup) for more details on how to get your computers set up.

### <a name="difference"></a>Whatâ€™s the difference between App Lab, Circuit Playground, and Maker Toolkit?

**App Lab** is a web-based programming environment for building apps using Javascript with either blocks or text. App Lab features prominently in both CS Principles and CS Discoveries

The **Circuit Playground** is an series of circuit boards produced by Adafruit with a variety of sensors and ouputs built in. There are two variants of the Circuit Playground, both compatible with CS Discoveries:

* The Circuit Playground Classic - the first version of this board which can be programmed with either Maker Toolkit or the Arduino IDE
* The Circuit Playground Express - the newer version of this board which can be programmed with the Maker Toolkit, Microsoft Makecode, Scratch 3.0, Circuit Python, and more .

_Wondering which version you have? Check out [Adafruit's guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-circuit-playground/classic-vs-express)._

The **Maker Toolkit** is an additional set of commands in App Lab that allow you to communicate with and control a Circuit Playground plugged into USB. You can enable the Maker Toolkit in any App Lab project by clicking the settings gear above the toolbox and selecting "Enable Maker Toolkit."

The **Maker App** is a standalone app that allows the Circuit Playground to communicate with the App Lab and the Maker Toolkit.

## <a name="classroom"></a>Getting Circuit Playgrounds for your Classroom

<div class="col-66", style="margin-top:15px">

<p>Code.org has partnered with Adafruit to create a <a href="//www.adafruit.com/product/3399", target="_blank">classroom kit</a> of Circuit Playground boards and accessories necessary for implementing CS Discoveries Unit 6, Physical Computing. The kit contains 15 Circuit Playground boards, 15 Micro USB cables to connect the board to a computer, and a few other accessories. The curriculum is designed for a 2:1 student to board ratio, so a single classroom kit supports a classroom of 30 students.</p>
 
<p>For smaller classrooms, we recommend investing in a set of <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3795", target=_"blank">Circuit Playground Individual Kits</a>. The individual kit is designed for a single student or share-pair and costs $29.96.</p>

### Budgeting for the Circuit Playground classroom kit

The full cost of the Circuit Playground classroom kit is $350. All educators receive a 10% discount when they apply the code **ADAEDU** at checkout, which reduces the price of the kit to approximately $315. *Note: The ADAEDU code only applies to orders of $250 or greater.* 

Many teachers are able to request funding from their school's technology budget to cover the full cost. 

However, we understand that the expense of the classroom kit can be a barrier to implementing the full course, especially in low-income schools. Code.org is able to fully subsidize a limited number of classroom kits for teachers in the 2019-20 CS Discoveries Professional Learning Program who are unable to secure funding. Please read below for the full eligiblility requirements for this subsidy.

### <a name="subsidy"></a> Circuit Playground classroom kit subsidy program

**Available starting January 2020**

If you are participating in the 2019-20 CS Discoveries Professional Learning Program, implementing the full-year version of the course, and are not able to secure funding for the classroom kit locally, we may be able to fully subsidize a single classroom kit for you. To qualify for a fully subsidized kit, you must meet **all** of the following requirements:

- Teach at a school with 50% or greater free/reduced price meals, according to data from the <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/", target=_"blank">National Center for Education Statistics</a>.
- Be a participant in the 2019-20 Code.org Professional Learning Program for CS Discoveries (i.e. attended a 5-day summer workshop for CS Discoveries), OR be a participant in the 2019-20 Facilitator development program as a novice CS Discoveries facilitator.
- Completed the first semester of the CS Discoveries course with at least one section of 10 or more students who have made measurable progress in Units 2 **and** 3 of CS Discoveries on Code.org. *Note: Content learned in Unit 3 is a prerequisite for Unit 6.*
- Committed to attending Academic Year Workshop 4, covering Unit 6 (for in-person Professional Learning Program participants) or the last 2 modules (for virtual Professional Learning Program participants).
- Will teach Unit 6 by the end of the 2020-21 school year. When the program launches in January 2020, we will ask interested teachers to fill out a Unit 6 implementation plan template in the semester they will be teaching Unit 6 and submit it to us at <a href="mailto:teacher@code.org">teacher@code.org</a>

**By the end of January 2020,** teachers in the 2019-20 CS Discoveries Professional Learning Program will receive an email from us with more information about how to request a subsidy for the Adafruit Circuit Playground classroom kit on our website if they are unable to secure funding and are otherwise qualified.

### <a name="subsidy"></a> For teachers in Code.org's 2018-19 CS Discoveries Professional Learning Program
For teachers participating in the 2018-19 CS Discoveries Professional Learning Program and implementing the full-year version of the course, we're happy to announce that we
will be subsidizing the cost of a single classroom kit for each teacher.

To receive a fully subsidized circuit playground, teachers must meet **all** of the following requirements:

* Be a "qualified teacher" in the 2018-19 Code.org Professional Learning Program for CS Discoveries. Qualified teachers must have either: attended a 5-day summer workshop for CS Discoveries in 2018 as a participant, OR are participating in the 2018-19 Facilitator Development Program as a new CS Discoveries facilitator.
* Completed the first semester of the CS Discoveries curriculum with students. Qualified teachers must have at least one section of CS Discoveries on Code.org with at least 10 students who have made measurable progress in Units 2 **and** 3. (Note: content learned in Unit 3 is a prerequisite for Unit 6)
* Will teach Unit 6 by the end of the 2019-20 school year.

If you meet **all** of the eligibility requirements, you will qualify for a subsidy based on the free and reduced price meal rates at your school (based on data from the <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/", target="_blank">National Center for Education Statistics</a>):

* **For teachers in schools with 40% or greater free/reduced price meals,** the classroom kit will be 100% subsidized, resulting in no cost to the teacher/school, including shipping.
* **For teachers at schools with less than 40% free/reduced price meals,** the classroom kit will not be subsidized. Teachers will be expected to pay for the full cost of the kit (approx. $350), though this price will be reduced by a 10% discount for educators to an approximate total of $315. To get the educator discount, teachers must apply the code ADAEDU at checkout.

If a teacher has a smaller class size and does not qualify for or need a full 15 board kit (which supports 30 students), they may purchase a <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3795", target=_"blank">Code.org Circuit Playground Individual Kit</a>. The Individual Kit is designed for a single student or share-pair and costs $29.95.

**By the end of January 2019,** teachers will receive an email from us with more information about how to request a subsidy for the Adafruit Circuit Playground classroom kit on our website. In the meantime, qualified teachers should make sure they're on track in the 2018-19 school year to complete the first semester of CS Discoveries (Units 1-3) with their students.
