# Native American and Indigenous Peoples Initiative

Native American communities have unique experiences, barriers, and challenges in offering and fully engaging in computer science (CS) education in their K-12 systems. Data gathered in the <a href="https://code.org/yourschool/about" target=_blank>K-12 Computer Science Access Report</a> shows that Native American students are far less likely to attend a school that offers computer science (51% as opposed to the next lowest access group, Black students at 70%). This is even more significant than it seems since many students attending schools with access are likely attending schools in or near urban centers. Therefore, the disparity is even larger for Native American students attending school within rural and majority native communities. 

To close these access gaps, Code.org and others across the CS education landscape must: 

1) better understand the specific reasons why Native American schools and students do not have access to CS education, and 

2) take strategic and intentional approaches to increase participation by Native American K-12 students and the engagement of their teachers.


## What Code.org is doing

Code.org is actively learning from students, teachers, and administrators and developing new relationships to learn how to better support Native communities.  As we learn more, Code.org will take on specific activities, programs, and partnerships to help make computer science more accessible in indigenous communities.  

## CS Teachers in Native Communities Affinity Group

Monthly, 3rd Tuesdays of the month

Code.org is gathering a teacher affinity group // professional learning community of fellow CS teachers serving mostly Native American students.  These monthly virtual gatherings are a space for teachers to connect with one another, share resources, offer collective problem-solving, and more.  

Please have any interested teachers reach out to sung[at]code.org to be added to the calendar invite and sent the zoom link information for the next gathering.
