# How to Help

## Ask your school to teach computer science
Encourage your local school to start teaching computer science. To make it easier, Code.org offers [courses for every grade level](https://studio.code.org/courses?view=teacher) from kindergarten through high school at no cost. And, teachers can enroll in our [hands-on professional learning workshops](/educate/professional-learning) offered locally across the United States.

## Help us spread the word
Follow us [on Facebook](http://facebook.com/Code.org) or [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/codeorg) and re-share our posts.  Or stay in touch with our [quarterly email updates](http://go.pardot.com/l/153401/2018-01-12/k555vp).

Petition your state to allow computer science to count towards math or science high school graduation credits. And promote computer science in your area with these [stats, quotes and videos](/promote).

## Learn about our advocacy efforts in your state
Learn more about [Code.org's advocacy work](https://advocacy.code.org) across the U.S. and the nine policies we recommend states adopt to make computer science foundational for all students. And, find out how you can drive change in your state.

## Host an Hour of Code - at work, in your community, or local school
Millions of people of all ages have learned an [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com), a one-hour introductory course designed to demystify computer science and show that anybody can learn the basics. Anybody, anywhere, anytime can learn an Hour of Code.

## Buy a CODE hat or t-shirt
Support our work and wear the movement with pride. Our hats have been worn by President Obama and celebrities too.

## Make a generous donation or have Amazon do it for you
We're working to give *every* student the opportunity to learn computer science — online and in schools where we’ll establish permanent courses and train teachers. One child learns for every dollar you donate. If you shop on Amazon, use [AmazonSmile](/donate/amazonsmile) and choose Code.org as your charity to donate a percent of all your purchases to Code.org.

## Translate our tutorials
Volunteers have translated our tutorials in over 40 languages. Help us continue to expand our tutorials for students around the world!

## Teach an online course to your child, or in any classroom
Code.org's online platform [Code Studio](https://studio.code.org/courses?view=teacher) enables students to learn the basic concepts of computer science as early as kindergarten. You don't need any prior experience to get started - you can learn along with your children. If you do know some programming, try [App Lab](/educate/applab), a JavaScript programming environment for high school students to create apps.
