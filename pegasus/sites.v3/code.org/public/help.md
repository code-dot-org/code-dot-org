# How to Help

## Make a generous donation
We're working to give every student the opportunity to learn computer science — online and in schools where we’ll establish permanent courses and train teachers. For every dollar you donate, one child will be introduced to computer science.

[<button>Donate now</button>](https://donate.code.org/give/172233/#!/donation/checkout)     [<button>Start a fundraiser</button>](https://donate.code.org/campaign/computer-science-education/c142257)

## Have Amazon make a donation for you
If you shop on Amazon, use [AmazonSmile](/donate/amazonsmile) and choose Code.org as your charity to donate a percent of all your purchases to Code.org.

## Ask your school to teach computer science
Encourage your local school to start teaching computer science. To make it easier, Code.org offers [courses for every grade level](https://studio.code.org/courses?view=teacher) from kindergarten through high school at no cost. And, teachers can enroll in our [hands-on professional learning workshops](/educate/professional-learning) offered locally across the United States.

## Help us spread the word
Follow us [on Facebook](http://facebook.com/Code.org) or [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/codeorg) and re-share our posts.  Or stay in touch with our [quarterly email updates](http://go.pardot.com/l/153401/2018-01-12/k555vp).

Petition your state to allow computer science to count towards math or science high school graduation credits. And promote computer science in your area with these [stats, quotes and videos](/promote).

## Teach an online course to your child, or in any classroom
Code.org's online platform [Code Studio](https://studio.code.org/courses?view=teacher) enables students to learn the basic concepts of computer science as early as kindergarten. You don't need any prior experience to get started - you can learn along with your children. If you do know some programming, try [App Lab](/educate/applab), a JavaScript programming environment for high school students to create apps.
