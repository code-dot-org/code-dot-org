# How to Help

## Make a generous donation
We're working to give every student the opportunity to learn computer science — online and in schools where we’ll establish permanent courses and train teachers. For every dollar you donate, one child will be introduced to computer science.

<a class="link-button" href="https://donate.code.org/give/172233/#!/donation/checkout">Donate now</a> <a class="link-button" href="https://donate.code.org/campaign/computer-science-education/c142257">Start a fundraiser</a>


## Donate through DAF Direct
Donate through your donor advised fund with Fidelity Charitable, Schwab Charitable or BNY Mellon and make your grant recommendation to Code.org through the DAF Direct online form.

## Ask your school to teach computer science
Encourage your local school to start teaching computer science. To make it easier, Code.org offers [courses for every grade level](https://studio.code.org/catalog) from kindergarten through high school at no cost. And, teachers can enroll in our [hands-on professional learning workshops](/educate/professional-learning) offered locally across the United States.

## Help us spread the word
Follow us [on Facebook](http://facebook.com/Code.org) or [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/codeorg) and re-share our posts.  Or stay in touch with our [quarterly email updates](http://go.pardot.com/l/153401/2018-01-12/k555vp).

Petition your state to allow computer science to count towards math or science high school graduation credits. And promote computer science in your area with these [stats, quotes and videos](/promote).

## Teach an online course to your child, or in any classroom
Code.org's online platform [Code Studio](https://code.org/teach) enables students to learn the basic concepts of computer science as early as kindergarten. You don't need any prior experience to get started - you can learn along with your children. If you do know some programming, try [App Lab](/educate/applab), a JavaScript programming environment for high school students to create apps.
