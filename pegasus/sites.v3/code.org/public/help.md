# How to Help
## Host an Hour of Code - at work, in your community, or local school
Millions of people of all ages have learned an [Hour of Code](http://hourofcode.com), a one-hour introductory course designed to demystify computer science and show that anybody can learn the basics.

## Make a generous donation
We're working to give *every* student the opportunity to learn computer science — online and in schools where we’ll establish permanent courses and train teachers. One child learns for every dollar you donate.

[<button>Please consider a donation</button>](/donate)

## Ask your school to teach computer science
Encourage local elementary schools to teach our [elementary curriculum](/k5) or recruit teachers to attend a [one-day workshop](/professional-development-workshops)- at no cost. Or [partner with Code.org](/educate/districts) to bring permanent courses into middle and high schools.

## Advocate for computer science locally
Petition your state to allow computer science to count towards math or science high school graduation credits. And promote computer science in your area with these [stats, quotes and videos](/promote).

### Or become a volunteer teacher yourself with one of these organizations:

- [CoderDojo](http://www.coderdojo.com) - Start a Dojo in your neighborhood, mentor children to learn to code.
- [TEALS](http://www.tealsk12.org) - Volunteer to teach Intro and AP CS classes 2 days a week in local high schools.
- [Citizen Schools](http://www.citizenschools.org/curriculum-category/science-technology/) - Volunteer to teach computer programming in extended-day programs at schools.


## Teach an online course to your child, or in any classroom
Code.org's online platform [Code Studio](http://studio.code.org) enables students to learn the basic concepts of computer science as early as kindergarten. Within Code Studio, a new Play Lab has been developed where elementary students can create and send apps or animations directly to a cell phone, just by typing in the phone number.
