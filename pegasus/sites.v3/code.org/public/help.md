# How to Help

## Make a generous donation
We're working to give *every* student the opportunity to learn computer science — online and in schools where we’ll establish permanent courses and train teachers. One child learns for every dollar you donate.

[<button>Please consider a donation</button>](/donate)

## Ask your school to teach computer science
Encourage local elementary schools to teach our [elementary curriculum](/k5) or recruit teachers to attend a [one-day workshop](/professional-development-workshops)- at no cost. Or [partner with Code.org](/educate/districts) to bring permanent courses into middle and high schools.

## Advocate for computer science locally
Petition your state to allow computer science to count towards math or science high school graduation credits. And promote computer science in your area with these [stats, quotes and videos](/promote).

[<button>Add your support</button>](/promote)

## Translate our tutorials
Volunteers have translated our tutorials in over 40 languages. Help us continue to expand our tutorials for students around the world!

## Buy a CODE hat or t-shirt
Support our work and wear the movement with pride. Our hats have been worn by President Obama and celebrities too.

## Host an Hour of Code - at work, in your community, or local school
Millions of people of all ages have learned an [Hour of Code](http://code.org/learn), a one-hour introductory course designed to demystify computer science and show that anybody can learn the basics. Anybody, anywhere, anytime can learn an Hour of Code.

## Teach an online course to your child, or in any classroom
Code.org's online platform [Code Studio](https://studio.code.org) enables students to learn the basic concepts of computer science as early as kindergarten. Try [Play Lab](/playlab), a tool developed for elementary students to create games and stories. Or try [App Lab](/educate/applab), a JavaScript programming environment for high school students to create apps.
