# How to Help

## Ask your school to teach computer science
Encourage local elementary schools to teach our [elementary curriculum](/k5) or recruit teachers to attend a [one-day workshop](/professional-development-workshops)- at no cost. Or [partner with Code.org](/educate/districts) to bring permanent courses into middle and high schools.

## Host an Hour of Code - at work, in your community, or local school
Millions of people of all ages have learned an [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com), a one-hour introductory course designed to demystify computer science and show that anybody can learn the basics. Anybody, anywhere, anytime can learn an Hour of Code.

## Want to inspire students? Offer help to local teachers
Volunteer to teach the Hour of Code or our [Code Studio courses](http://studio.code.org) to local students. Sign up to hear about volunteer opportunities near you.

## Make a generous donation or have Amazon do it for you
We're working to give *every* student the opportunity to learn computer science — online and in schools where we’ll establish permanent courses and train teachers. One child learns for every dollar you donate. If you shop on Amazon, use [AmazonSmile](/donate/amazonsmile) and choose Code.org as your charity to donate a percent of all your purchases to Code.org.

## Translate our tutorials
Volunteers have translated our tutorials in over 40 languages. Help us continue to expand our tutorials for students around the world!

## Teach an online course to your child, or in any classroom
Code.org's online platform [Code Studio](https://studio.code.org/courses?view=teacher) enables students to learn the basic concepts of computer science as early as kindergarten. Try [Play Lab](/playlab), a tool developed for elementary students to create games and stories. Or try [App Lab](/educate/applab), a JavaScript programming environment for high school students to create apps.
