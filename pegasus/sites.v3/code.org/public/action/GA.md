# Help AP Computer Science count for graduation in YOUR school

The College Board, Code.org, CSTA, and a coalition of partners spent the last year helping states revise or enact policies to allow computer science to count towards a high school science graduation requirement. Research has shown that students are more likely to try computer science when it is part of the academic pathway rather than an elective. And computer science teachers have told us their work is valued more as well when it’s categorized this way. 

Through the Board of Regents, the <a href="http://www.gadoe.org/Curriculum-Instruction-and-Assessment/CTAE/Documents/Fourth-Science-Options-2013.pdf" target="_blank">Georgia Department of Education</a> now recognizes Advanced Placement Computer Science A as a fourth science course towards graduation. This policy indicates that districts can and should count AP Computer Science A towards the required science graduation standards. 

To ensure all students have access to computer science education, **please use the sample letter below to urge your principal or district superintendent to implement this change.**

Dear Administrator, 

I’m writing to urge you to implement a district-wide change to allow computer science to count as a science graduation credit in our district. 

Computer science drives job growth and innovation throughout our economy and society. More than half of projected jobs in STEM fields are in computing occupations; computing occupations dominate “help wanted” ads; and computer science is one of the most in-demand degrees for new college graduates. However, computer science education is offered sparingly and underrepresented groups --especially girls and students of color-- report barriers to entry in the field and in accessing academic courses.   

To make computer science more accessible for all students, the <a href="http://www.gadoe.org/Curriculum-Instruction-and-Assessment/CTAE/Documents/Fourth-Science-Options-2013.pdf" target="_blank">Georgia Board of Regents</a> now recognizes AP Computer Science A as a fourth course option to count towards a science graduation requirement. This policy does not require students to study computer science; it simply allows students who choose to take computer science courses to satisfy a requirement that already exists. Research shows that students are more likely to try computer science when it is part of the academic pathway rather than an elective. Also, teachers are more likely to seek certification in the computer science pathway or professional development opportunities when structured this way. 

Thank you for making our district a leader in computer science education by fully implementing this policy passed by the Board of Regents to allow AP Computer Science A as a science graduation credit. Your efforts surrounding this matter will help prepare students for the 21st century workforce.  

Sincerely, 

Your name



## Frequently Asked Questions

Where can I find more information about adding computer science courses at my school? 

+ Resources, including curriculum and professional development opportunities, are available [here](/educate/districts). Additionally, learn more about Code.org’s district partnerships and how over 60 schools districts across the U.S. are expanding computer science education. 
+ An inventory of computer science education resources and tools are also available [here](/educate/3rdparty). 
Share these resources with your K-5 partner schools and encourage elementary schools to expose students to computer science early! A number of videos and resources are available [here](/educate/inspire) to help get students started in or outside of the classroom.

What’s a good way to get kids excited about computer science?

+ Try the [Hour of Code](http://hourofcode.com)! Or one of the [other tutorials](/learn/beyond) from Code.org and our many partners. Students have written over 5 billion lines of code, 1 billion of which was written in January 2015. Students of all ages love learning how to code and about computer science through fun and interactive curriculum.

How can our district get more girls and underrepresented students of color taking computer science?

+ Research shows that underrepresented students—especially girls—are more likely to take computer science if it counts as academic credit (in this case, science).
+ The Hour of Code is a great way to de-mystify computer science. In 2014 alone, of the 60 million students who tried the Hour of Code nearly 48% were female (among all participants) and 36% were African American, Hispanic American, or Native American (among the US participants). 
Show students [videos](http://hourofcode.com/us/resources#videos) on the importance of computer science education from special messengers, such as Chris Bosh, Bill Gates, Susan Wojcicki, President Obama, among others! 

My school district does not currently count computer science as a science credit. How can I help my district implement this policy?  

+ Use the above letter to send to your district superintendent or administrator. This letter is tailored to your state and outlines where the Georgia Department of Education counts AP Computer Science A as a science graduation credit. 
+ Urge your school board to send a memo to all principals and guidance counselors clarifying that computer science will now count as a science graduation requirement in accordance with Georgia Department of Education. 
+ Ask your school board pass a proclamation to recognize the new graduation requirements. 
+ Share this letter and information with computer science students and parents and urge them to contact your school board.
