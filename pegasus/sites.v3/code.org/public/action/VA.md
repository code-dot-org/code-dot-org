# Help AP Computer Science count for graduation in YOUR school

The College Board, Code.org, CSTA, and a coalition of partners spent the last year helping states revise or enact policies to allow computer science to count towards high school math or science graduation requirements. Research has shown that students are more likely to try computer science when it is part of the academic pathway rather than an elective. And computer science teachers have told us their work is valued more as well when it’s categorized this way. 

Passing the Virginia State Legislature in 2014, <a href="https://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?141+ful+CHAP0590"_blank">HB 1054</a> allows computer science courses to count as a mathematics, science, or career technical education (CTE) graduation credit. Accordingly, the Virginia State Board of Education recently passed the  <a href="http://www.doe.virginia.gov/boe/meetings/2015/01_jan/agenda_items/item_h.pdf">graduation standards</a> for computer science courses.   

This law and Board-approved standards indicate that districts can and should count computer science towards a graduation requirement in the mathematics, science, or CTE fields. To ensure all students have access to computer science education, **please use the sample letter below to urge your principal or district superintendent to implement this change.**

Dear Administrator, 

I’m writing to urge you to implement a district-wide change to allow computer science to count as a mathematics, science or CTE graduation credit in our district, and communicate the change to all students. 

Computer science drives job growth and innovation throughout our economy and society. More than half of projected jobs in STEM fields are in computing occupations; computing occupations dominate “help wanted” ads; and computer science is one of the most in-demand degrees for new college graduates. However, computer science education is offered sparingly and underrepresented groups --especially girls and students of color-- report barriers to entry in the field and in accessing academic courses.   


To make computer science more accessible for all students, the Virginia State Legislature passed <a href="https://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?141+ful+CHAP0590"_blank">HB 1054</a> in 2014 to direct school districts to allow computer science courses to count towards high school math, science, or Career Technical Education (CTE) graduation requirements. Accordingly, the Virginia State Board of Education recently passed the  <a href="http://www.doe.virginia.gov/boe/meetings/2015/01_jan/agenda_items/item_h.pdf">graduation standards</a> for computer science courses. 

This policy does not require students to study computer science; it simply allows students who choose to take computer science courses to satisfy a requirement that already exists. Research shows that students are more likely to try computer science when it is part of the academic pathway rather than an elective. Also, teachers are more likely to seek certification in the computer science pathway or professional development opportunities when structured this way. 

Thank you for making our district a leader in computer science education by fully implementing HB 1054 to allow computer science to count as a mathematics, science, or CTE graduation requirement. Your efforts surrounding this matter will help prepare students for the 21st century workforce.  


Sincerely, 

Your name



## Frequently Asked Questions

Where can I find more information about adding computer science courses at my school? 

+ Resources, including curriculum and professional development opportunities, are available [here](/educate/districts). Additionally, learn more about Code.org’s district partnerships and how over 60 schools districts across the U.S. are expanding computer science education. 
+ An inventory of computer science education resources and tools are also available [here](/educate/3rdparty). 
Share these resources with your K-5 partner schools and encourage elementary schools to expose students to computer science early! A number of videos and resources are available [here](/educate/inspire) to help get students started in or outside of the classroom.

What’s a good way to get kids excited about computer science?

+ Try the [Hour of Code](http://hourofcode.com)! Or one of the [other tutorials](/learn/beyond) from Code.org and our many partners. Students have written over 5 billion lines of code, 1 billion of which was written in January 2015. Students of all ages love learning how to code and about computer science through fun and interactive curriculum.

How can our district get more girls and underrepresented minorities taking computer science?

+ Research shows that underrepresented students—especially girls—are more likely to take computer science if it counts as academic credit (in this case, mathematics, science and CTE).
+ The Hour of Code is a great way to de-mystify computer science. In 2014 alone, of the 60 million students who tried the Hour of Code nearly 48% were female (among all participants) and 36% were African American, Hispanic American, or Native American (among the US participants). 
Show students [videos](http://hourofcode.com/us/resources#videos) on the importance of computer science education from special messengers, such as Chris Bosh, Bill Gates, Susan Wojcicki, President Obama, among others! 


My school district does not currently count computer science as a mathematics, science, or CTE credit. How can I help my district implement this policy?  

+ Use the above letter to send to your district superintendent or administrator. This letter is tailored to your state and outlines the Virginia State Statute and Board of Education graduation standards that explicitly state that computer science counts towards a graduation credit.  
+ Urge your school board to send a memo to all principals and guidance counselors clarifying that computer science will now count as a graduation credit in accordance with HB 1054. 
+ Ask your school board to pass a proclamation to recognize the new graduation requirement. 
+ Share this letter and information with computer science students and parents and urge them to contact your school board. 

How will state universities count AP Computer Science and how will this affect the admissions process? 

+ While many universities defer to local and state graduation requirements and will accept qualifying AP scores as college credit, college admissions requirements completely depend on the state higher education system, and at times, the specific institution itself. Code.org recommends visiting the specific college or unversity website or speaking with an admissions officer to confirm how they count computer science courses. 

While computer science counts as a mathematics and/or science graduation credit for my state or school district, my state university system does not count it as such. How can I help my state higher education system implement this policy? 

+ In some states, a higher education governing body may have the authority to change public institution admissions requirements, while in others the State Legislature has the authority. Using the above letter as a starting point, send a letter to your higher education governing board and state representatives, highlighting the discrepancies of how computer science is treated at the high school graduation level and the university admissions level.  

How will the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) count AP Computer Science and how will this affect eligibility for athletic scholarships and recruitment? 

+ The NCAA recognizes the local and state high school graduation requirements for computer science. For example, if a school counts computer science as a mathematics or natural/ physical science graduation requirement, the NCAA will respect the graduation requirements set by the district and will also count a completed computer science course towards a mathematics and/or science credit. The NCAA policy on graduation credit eligibility can be found <a href="http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/eligibility_center/CoreCourseInfo/Common_Core_Course_Questions/engage.html"_blank">here</a>.
