# Code.org partners with ACM, grows team

**Code.org merges with Computing in the Core and Technically Learning, and grows executive team.**

SEATTLE, July 31, 2013 - Code.org, a non-profit dedicated to growing K-12 computer science education in America, announced today partnerships with the Association for Computing Machinery(ACM), mergers with advocacy coalition Computing in the Core and nonprofit Technically Learning, and a new hire, former PopCap Games senior executive, James Gwertzman.

“Our goal is to ensure that every K-12 student in the US has the opportunity to study computer science,” said Hadi Partovi, CEO and founder of Code.org. “ACM is a known leader of the computer science community and has made a major contribution by partnering with Code.org, lending key staffing support, and supporting our merger with Computing in the Core. We’re excited to be working together to change education policies and grow cultural awareness in support of widespread computer science education.”

Computing in the Core, a non-partisan advocacy coalition, was founded in 2010 by the ACM with support from several other partners, including the Computer Science Teachers Association, Microsoft, Google, and the National Center for Women and Information Technology. ACM’s new partnership with Code.org includes the interim assignment of Cameron Wilson, ACM Director of Public Policy, to be the Chief Operating Officer of Code.org.

“ACM is proud to have Cameron at the forefront of such an important issue,” said John White, CEO of the ACM. “Few careers offer as many opportunities as computer science to solve challenging issues facing the global economy. It’s vitally important that we continue to advocate for strong computer science education programs to ensure that the nation has the skilled workforce it desperately needs.”

Going forward, Code.org and Computing in the Core will assume responsibility for organizing the annual national Computer Science Education Week, held this year December 8-14. CSEdWeek was first launched by ACM in 2009 and has been held each year since.

Coinciding with the Computing in the Core merger, Seattle-based nonprofit Technically Learning is merging with Code.org to help fulfill the organization’s bigger mission to bring computer science to every school. “We’re very excited to bring our background in teacher professional development and curriculum to help Code.org scale their program nationally, to integrate computer science in all schools and equip all students with the skills to succeed in the 21st Century,” remarked Technically Learning Board President, Rebecca Deutsch.

Lastly, Code.org has expanded its executive team by hiring James Gwertzman, a long-time game industry executive and recent senior executive at PopCap Games, as its Chief Evangelist. “It’s hard to believe that there are fewer students studying computer science in America today than 10 years ago,” commented Mr. Gwertzman. “I recently returned from living and working in China, where 100% of K-12 students study computer programming. Here in the US it’s less than 5%. I’m thrilled to join Code.org, and help start turning this around.”  Other additions to the Code.org team include curriculum researcher Nan Li, Ph.D.  from Carnegie Mellon University, and Director of Education Pat Yongpradit.
