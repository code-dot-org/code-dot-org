# Saving Progress in Hour of Code Tutorials (December 3 - 11)

### For students
We’re so excited that you’re trying out an Hour of Code!  You might be wondering why your bubbles are gray and aren’t turning green like you may be used to.  


This week, millions of students are trying computer science for the Hour of Code. With so many students at the same time, our systems are overloaded!  This means we can’t save progress and mark the bubbles green as you solve new puzzles. 


But, keep going! You can still do the full Hour of Code tutorial and get your certificate of completion at the end.

### For teachers
Part of Code.org’s mission is to remove the obstacles that keep students all over the world from the opportunity to learn computer science. That’s why we offer tools, curriculum, and resources for teachers at no cost. We’re also thrilled that we’ve been able to introduce millions of students to computer science through the Hour of Code campaign. During Computer Science Education Week this year, our servers will be overloaded again as organizers across the globe lead their classrooms through activities.


It’s an exciting time of year, but our servers can’t handle it! We can’t store progress for this many students simultaneously.

**Due to this, we unfortunately will not be saving or reporting student progress on the Hour of Code tutorials from December 3-11.**

Everything else in the Hour of Code tutorials will continue to work as expected. Your students can fully participate in Hour of Code this year - the only difference is that their bubbles won’t turn green if they are signed in. Your students will still be able to get their certificate of completion.   


We are thrilled that you are trying out the Hour of Code this week with your students. Thank you so much for supporting the K–12 computer science movement in the US. If you have any questions, please contact us at [http://code.org/contact](http://code.org/contact).
