        Photos from Code.org workshops are commonly posted to social media by other workshop attendees,

        %strong
          If you do not wish to have your photo taken and potentially used for this purpose, click "No" below.
          It is then your responsibility to communicate this to your workshop facilitator in advance.

        photographs of me and my personal property during the duration of this and any future professional
        development workshops provided by Code.org, for the sole purpose of posting to social media and
        other similar digital marketing. I further acknowledge that participation is voluntary and that
        neither I or nor Code.org will receive financial compensation of any type associated with the
        publication of these photographs, and that publication of said photos confers no rights of ownership
        or royalties whatsoever. I hereby release Code.org, its contractors, its employees and any third
