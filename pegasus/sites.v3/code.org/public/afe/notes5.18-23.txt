Cherry picking stats
Focus on recruiting men
Needed to step back - emotional response inappropriate
Didn't listen
Centered on Hadi as victim
Name dropping people as examples
No retaliation - zoom chats and people bringing up stuff and questions
Unclear about where the message coming from.
Negotiation over value and tactics
Everyone in the org as best intentions
Passions overflow
Meg- just profound sadness both for Hadi and the team of the letter.
Newest face - didn't phase me at all
Appreciate all of the team so much.
