Computer science is a foundational subject for a 21st century education. Students who study CS [perform better in other subjects, excel at problem solving, and are 17% more likely to attend college](https://medium.com/@codeorg/cs-helps-students-outperform-in-school-college-and-workplace-66dd64a69536). By offering CS to more students, we’re helping create new opportunities for them.

Code.org has partnered with Amazon Future Engineer in India to reach students from underserved and underrepresented communities. Amazon Future Engineer is a comprehensive childhood-to-career community program providing students early exposure and access to CS education through online and blended learning formats.

## A deep partner network

Code.org and Amazon have partnered with multiple education-focused organizations to provide high-quality CS education to students in government schools across the states of Karnataka, Delhi, Haryana, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, and Telangana. The initiative will primarily focus on students in grades 6-12, and will also train teachers and educators to teach computer science in a more engaging way. Here are the specific partners that will be using Code.org materials as part of their programs:

* [American India Foundation](https://aif.org/)
* [Educational Initiatives](https://www.ei-india.com/)
* [Learning Links Foundation](https://www.learninglinksindia.org/)
* [Leadership for Equity](https://www.leadershipforequity.org/) and [Pi Jam Foundation](https://www.thepijam.org/)
* [Peepul](https://www.peepulindia.org/)

## The Code.org program
Code.org provides a complete CS program designed around our [open source curriculum](https://studio.code.org/courses?view=teacher).
