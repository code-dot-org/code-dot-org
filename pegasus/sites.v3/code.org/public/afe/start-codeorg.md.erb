## The Code.org program for middle schools and high schools
Code.org provides a complete CS program combining [open source K-12 curriculum](https://studio.code.org/courses?view=teacher) with [professional learning](https://code.org/educate/professional-learning/middle-high).

### Engaging curriculum designed to support beginners and challenge students of all levels
Our team designed our courses to support students and teachers new to the discipline, and to engage and challenge students of all levels. Every lesson plan and activity is tested by a diverse mix of classrooms around the country to make sure it’s appropriate and engaging for all students. Both courses we offer for middle and high school students are mapped to the newly revised 2017 CSTA standards.

**Our curriculum and platform are free for anyone, anywhere, to use - always.**

Being a Title I school, a lot of our students don't have access to personal computers or laptops, so they can end up falling behind in terms of technology. We do our best to keep them motivated and show them the potential that learning how to code has on their future.”</p>
