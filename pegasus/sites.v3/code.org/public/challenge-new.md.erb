## How to win the classroom chat

Teachers or students: Do this activity with your classroom and enter as one to be eligible to win the classroom chat with Band. Submit your entry (see above), and if you are selected, we will work with you to set up a time when the band can call into your class for a 10-15 minute video chat.<p>

## How do I increase my chances of winning?
Code.org will select winners from the posted Dance Party projects on social media and submitted via the entry form. Increase your chances to win with photos or videos of yourself or your class.

The posts that have the most cool stuff will have a great chance of being selected, so include a link to the choreography you made with Dance Party, and/or a video of you dancing along with your creation. Have fun!

Posts with more likes, shares, and retweets will also have a higher likelihood of winning. 

And since you can post as many entries as you want, across Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Tiktok, feel free to make multiple posts to increase your chances. The idea isn't to spam the internet and annoy your friends, it's to celebrate computer science. So please try to make the content you post worthwhile for all of us.

## How do you get the project link to share?
When you're done with any of our activities, click "Finish" on the last level, and you'll receive a share link. You can also take a video of you or your students demo-ing their project and share that.
