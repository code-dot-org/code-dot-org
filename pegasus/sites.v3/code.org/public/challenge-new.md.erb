# Join the Band Dance Party!

Band and Code.org believe in the power of computer science education for every student, in every classroom around the world. That’s why we’re teaming up to inspire students everywhere to code and dance — let’s celebrate the magic of computer science and music! 

Join the party by using Code.org’s Dance Party activity to code your own choreography to Band's “Song.” Get creative with classic moves, and have fun with new album-inspired visuals and dancer formations!

Post or submit your creations for Band and Code.org to see, and we’ll share the best ones on social media. Plus, you’ll get a chance to win tickets to see Band on tour, or a chance for your classroom to video chat with the band.

We can’t wait to see and share what you create! 


## How to join the fun — code, dance, and share!
<ol>
<li>Start <a href="https://code.org/dance">Dance Party</a></li>
<li>Learn to code your own dance in a short 10-step tutorial</li>
<li>On the final level, code an awesome dance to Band's song, “Song.” (Don’t forget to try out the special “Song” background effect!)</li>
<li>Click “Finish” to get a share link to your project.</li>
<li>For extra fun, make a video of yourself dancing along with your code!</li>
</ol>

## Share your creations for Code.org and Band to see!

We’d love to see what classrooms and students create — whether it’s dance moves in code, or a video of students dancing along. Band and Code.org will re-share or comment on the most creative stuff we see. There are two ways to share:
<p>
### Post on social media:
<a href="#howtowin"><img src="/images/marketing/promo/entry_graphic2.png" style="max-width: 50%"></a>
<ol><strong>
<li>Tell us your concert city. <a href="https://www.coldplay.com/tour/">See list of tour cities here.</a> Available tickets are for the first night of each city.</li>
<li>Tag Code.org and use #codeplay</li>
<li>Show us your "Song" Dance Party creation!</li></strong>
</ol>
<p>
<em>If you post to social media, make sure to follow Code.org so we can message you.</em>
<p>
### Submit your entry via form:
If you want to make certain we see what you create, OR if you’re not comfortable posting to social media, you can also submit your creation <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScEEkMIZfMiXtceBndz0cRbPVzLxbR2XcwmxY7qqSH6nP_0cA/viewform?usp=sf_link">via this form</a>. 

<em>Note: In most countries, use of social media is not permitted for underage students. Do not post videos or photos of students without the permission of a parent or guardian.</em>

## Make the coolest dance and win concert tickets, or even meet Band!

In every city on the <a href="https://www.coldplay.com/tour/">tour</a> we will pick two students and two chaperones to receive free tickets to the concert — we will pick from projects posted or submitted by individual/single students. We will also select at least one lucky classroom globally to have a video call with the band, and we will pick among the projects that feature entire classrooms dancing.

## How will Code.org pick who gets to see the band?

We’ll be looking first and foremost for creativity and fun — code a “Song” dance that really wows, and ideally pair it up with some actual dancing. For example, check out this (unfinished) choreography made by a former Code.org engineer — feel free to remix, change, and complete it. For extra fun, record a video of yourself and/or friends dancing to your creation! If you use TikTok, consider recording a duet format like this: 

Grab attention with entries that get lots of likes, comments, or re-shares on social media — across Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, or Facebook.  And Band and Code.org will share, favorite, or comment on especially awesome posts. 

Code.org will select winners from the posted Dance Party projects on social media and submitted <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScEEkMIZfMiXtceBndz0cRbPVzLxbR2XcwmxY7qqSH6nP_0cA/viewform?usp=sf_link">via the entry form</a>. 


And of course, if you want to get selected, make sure to:
<ol>
<li>Follow the instructions above on how to post, to make sure we have everything we need </li>
<li>Do it early, because we need to give the tickets out well before the shows. In Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, and the United States you need to post or or submit your creations by March 4, 2022, to be eligible for tickets. The deadline for Europe and South America is June 10, 2022.</li>
</ol>
You can post multiple projects across Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Tiktok to impress us with your creativity.
