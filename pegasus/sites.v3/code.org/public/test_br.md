# 4 Ways to Recruit Girls to Try Computer Science
Computer science is foundational to many fields, but not enough girls are choosing to study it. Here are some proven methods for encouraging girls to take interest:[*](#notes)

## 1. Recruit girls with their friends
Reach out to other teachers, clubs, teams, or groups of friends at your school. Some girls may need a nudge to consider computer science, and will feel more comfortable trying it with friends, so they won’t be the only girl in the class.

## 2. Inspire with examples
Share how young women are thriving in computer science. Show them [inspirational videos](http://code.org/educate/inspire), especially [this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc&feature=c4-overview-vl&list=PLzdnOPI1iJNe1WmdkMG-Ca8cLQpdEAL7Q). Or invite female computer scientists a few years older than your students to share how they got into the field (Ask the local university CS department for help).

## 3. Fight stereotypes
Highlight women from all walks of life who code [(See some examples)](http://www.dotdiva.org/). [Studies](http://faculty.washington.edu/scheryan/research.htm) show decor matters: instead of posters of Star Trek or 1s and 0s, decorate the classroom with [posters of role models](http://code.org/educate/inspire#posters), or diverse groups of students.

## 4. Show how computer science can help [in every field](https://www.dropbox.com/s/o1mafeosi0xuwb0/What_is_CS_and_Careers.pdf) - from medicine to law to business
Computer science is about making a difference in the world, creating new things, and helping others. It’ll help you succeed, whether you want to be a doctor, a lawyer, a journalist, or even the next President.
