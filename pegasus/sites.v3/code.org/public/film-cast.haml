      Bronwen Grimes is half-artist, half-programmer and has been making video games for over a decade. She enjoys being part of the tight-knit technical art community, a small (but growing) collection of other artist-programmers who work in games. Growing up in Ottawa, the capital of Canada, she had an idyllic science nerd childhood. Her first experience with programming happened during a summer camp at Carleton University, where kids also got to synthesize nylon, extract cow DNA, and do the time warp again. Although Bronwen has a diploma in Digital Media Arts from Seneca College, she would say her education was mostly self-designed. She has taken classes in art, programming, and math from a half-dozen different schools to suit her unusual discipline. For the past 5 years she’s been at

His mom, Freida, was a systems analyst for a small computer company in Dallas.When it came time to choose a major at Georgia Tech, Chris planned to go with computer science but instead picked management when he was told the comp-sci course load might be too difficult for a freshman basketball player. For the time being, Chris has no plans to finish his degree, but he has used his computer knowledge to found a company, Max Deal Technologies, that provides tech solutions for a high-end clientele.
