    %h1 Code.org in Farsi
    %p There are over 110 million Farsi speakers worldwide. While the majority of native speakers live in Iran, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan, there are millions living as immigrants, migrants, and refugees around the world. With the Code.org in Farsi initiative, Farsi-speaking students will have the same access to our curricula that is already available to students in all other major languages of the world.

    %p Talent is everywhere, but opportunity is not. Code.org in Farsi opens a door to an opportunity that would otherwise be closed.

    %h2 Iran and Computer Science
    %p When you think of an algorithm, you may assume it's something new, but the concept of an algorithm was discovered in Iran over 1300 years ago. “Algorithm” is named after its inventor, the mathematician Al Khwarizmi, who lived in the land formerly known as Persia and now known as Iran. Once the epicenter of mathematics, science, philosophy, and medicine, Iran has made profound advances and impacts in technology.
    %p We invite you to celebrate Iranian contributions in technology by supporting Code.org and computer science education so that every kid in every school has the opportunity to learn how to code.

    %h2 Our Founders' Story

    %p Born in Iran, Hadi and Ali Partovi grew up during the Iran-Iraq war. Their neighborhood in Tehran was regularly bombed by Iraqi fighter jets. When they were 9 years old, their father, a physics professor, brought home a Commodore 64 computer. This computer was their escape from their surroundings – they learned how to code and create apps, games, and music. They immigrated to the United States at age 11. Soon after they turned 15, they spent their summers working as software engineers to help pay their way through high school and college. Upon graduating from Harvard University with Masters degrees in computer science, Hadi and Ali pursued careers in technology. They found success in the tech world and achieved the “American dream.” They became prolific angel investors, backing Facebook, Uber, Airbnb, and Dropbox, among others. In 2013, Hadi and Ali launched the education nonprofit Code.org, which Hadi continues to lead as CEO. Since its inception, Code.org has started a massive movement to teach computer science and coding to K-12 students globally. It is also the largest provider of computer science curricula in the world, with over 80 million student users in 180 countries.

    %h2.heading-sm Compliance In Support Of Farsi Translations
    %p.body-two As a U.S. nonprofit, Code.org is subject to laws regarding sanctions with Iran. After consulting with U.S. legal counsel experienced in the Iranian Sanctions and Translations Regulations (ITSR), Code.org believes that it may fund, prepare, and distribute the Farsi Translations of CS Curriculum in the United States and elsewhere around the world, including within Iran. The ITSR provides an exemption for “information and informational materials” (the IIM Exemption) and Code.org believes that this exemption will fully shield its funding, preparation, and distribution of the Farsi Translations and thus enable its Farsi Translations effort to proceed in full compliance with U.S. economic sanctions requirements.
