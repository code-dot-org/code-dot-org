# Guide for CS Fundamentals teachers during school closures

As more schools close in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many Code.org classrooms are moving to using our CS Fundamentals courses in a virtual setting or giving their students activities to keep learning at home.

## Resources to keep learning

Computer science is a great way to add some fun to extended time at home. However, the learning will take a different form when some kids are engaged regularly, some have only a little time, some have computers, and some don’t. 

Rather than trying to teach a synchronous class remotely, many teachers will be giving elementary school students activities they can do to maintain their interest as well as providing structure during their time at home.

<strong>We are compiling a list of activities on [code.org/athome](https://code.org/athome)</strong> that are ideal to share with students or families interested in doing some computer science on their own. This list includes activities for students with no computers or internet access. 

## Teaching CS Fundamentals Remotely

If your school is asking you to continue to teach virtually and you’re part way through CS Fundamentals, we recommend you have students continue their existing courses at home, but skip the unplugged lessons.

We designed the lessons in CS Fundamentals for use in a classroom with an actively engaged teacher, but many lessons can adapt well to at-home learning. Learning with CS Fundamentals does require an internet-connected device with a modern browser, something we realize not all students can access right now. 

You can track your [students’ progress](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/115000693231-Viewing-student-progress) to see where they are. You may be able to use resources like video conferencing or email to assist students and provide feedback.

## Where can I get help?

You are highly encouraged to share any questions or insights on our [CS Fundamentals Forum](https://forum.code.org/t/supporting-cs-fundamentals-students-during-school-closures/32456) where you can connect with other teachers. You can also email us at [support@code.org](mailto:support@code.org). We are here to help!

We also recommend you consider [CSTA's Resources to Support Teaching During COVID-19](https://csteachers.org/page/csta-compiled-resources-to-support-teaching-during-covid-19/) for an extensive set of options for continuing to teach computer science during school closures.
