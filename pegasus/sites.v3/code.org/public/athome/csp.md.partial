# Guide for CS Principles teachers during school closures

With schools closed around the country and around the world, many Code.org classrooms are moving to using our CS Principles curriculum in a virtual setting. This page is where we will be sharing updates, resources, and guidance on how to continue to support your students in that context.

If you are a teacher or parent interested in starting to teach a new course during a school closure, we do not recommend starting CS Principles virtually. Instead, choose from [our recommendations for learning at home](http://code.org/athome).

The primary resources we’ve put together here include:

* Recommendations for preparing your classroom for the Performance Tasks in a virtual setting
* Recommendations for modifying our CS Principles curriculum to a virtual setting if you are still teaching units in the course
* Recommendations for using Code.org tools virtually
* Links to outside resources

We know that teaching in a virtual setting is a new challenge for many. We also know that many of our students lack access to technology that would allow them to participate in virtual learning. We are working quickly to address this rapidly developing situation and will continue to update this page with resources and recommendations as we have them.

## Share on the Forum

You are highly encouraged to share any questions or insights on our [CS Principles Forum](http://forum.code.org/c/csp) where you'll find many other teachers working together to navigate the transition to virtual instruction.

## College Board Announcements and AP Testing

The College Board is updating [collegeboard.org/ap-covid19-updates](https://collegeboard.org/ap-covid19-updates) as they continue to announce their response to this rapidly changing situation. As of April 7th, when this page was last updated, these announcements included:

* Students will still submit their Create PT (60% of score) and Explore PT (40% of score) but there will be no multiple choice exam
* Both Performance Tasks will be due May 26th
* Students lacking laptop access at home should visit [cb.org/tech](http://cb.org/tech) for information on how to access a laptop
* The College Board is releasing video lessons explaining the task directions and showing how to complete the task.
 
## Performance Task Prep

We know many classrooms just started or have not yet started Create Performance Task. Our team has created a number of resources to help classrooms now teaching CSP virtually:

* [Virtual Create PT Survival Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16QwbnPFJl8u0fcsnu9ws2nuwJRMMu9F3aVRzLUNgaTI/edit#) and [Virtual Explore PT Survival Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eZFFp_tzn_MBz0FJaYcwFOX2trb0yBDDmDNo0zujA-E/edit) that compile all the resources normally found in our Create PT Prep and Explore PT Prep units into single documents that are easier to share and assign. Activities have also been modified to be better suited for a virtual and independent format.
* [Video Walkthrough: The Create PT in App Lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNlNFYJ9Spc) showing the different steps involved in actually programming a Create PT in App Lab
 
## Virtualization Plan - Unit by Unit
The recommendations below are for classrooms in which students will primarily be working independently and will have few opportunities to meet virtually with you or their classmates.

* **Unit 1 - The Internet** 
    * If students need to review this content assign the [Computers](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/ap-computer-science-principles/computers-101) and [Internet](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/ap-computer-science-principles/the-internet) units in the Khan Academy course
* **Unit 2 - Digital Information**
    * If students need to review this content assign the [Computers](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/ap-computer-science-principles/computers-101) and [Internet](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/ap-computer-science-principles/the-internet) units in the Khan Academy course
* **Unit 3 - Intro to Programming**
    * If students are still in this unit we recommend they complete only lessons 4 - 10 of this unit which teach turtle programming and top-down-design.
* **Unit 4 - Big Data and Privacy**
    * If students need to review this content assign the [TLS: Secure data transport](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/ap-computer-science-principles/the-internet#tls-secure-data-transport), [Cybercrime and prevention](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/ap-computer-science-principles/the-internet#cybercrime-and-prevention), [The digital divide](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/ap-computer-science-principles/global-impact-of-computing/the-digital-divide/a/the-global-digital-divide) and [Big data](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/ap-computer-science-principles/data-analysis-101#big-data) resources from the Khan Academy course 
* **Unit 5 - Building Apps:** Many of our teachers are in this unit right now and so we're offering more detailed recommendations. Most programming lessons in this unit can be completed independently if students have access to a computer and internet at home. Notable exceptions are highlighted below. Further down this document we have notes on how best to support students in a virtual setting and options for students with limited technology access.
As a reminder students have learned every concept necessary for the Create PT at the end of Unit 5 Chapter 1. Unit 5 Chapter 2 content is only important covered on the AP exam. 
    * **Lesson 3 - Building an App: Multi-screen App:** Do not complete the peer review as part of this project.
    * **Lesson 5: Building an App: Clicker Game:** Do not complete the peer review as part of this project.
    * **Lesson 7 - If-statements Unplugged:** This lesson is fully unplugged. The main activity could be assigned for students to complete independently and submit. It can also be skipped as these concepts are covered in the following lesson.
    * **Lesson 10 - Building and App: Color Sleuth:** Skip the Getting Started activity in the lesson plan which is designed around a full class discussion. Students should complete the full activity on Code studio. Communicate in advance with students so they understand this lesson is significantly different from others in the unit and is designed to highlight the steps of completing the Create Task.
    * **Lesson 11 - While Loops:** Skip the unplugged Getting Started activity and optional activity (Flowcharts with While Loops) that follows. Instruct students to complete the full lesson on Code Studio. 
    * **Lesson 12 - Loops and Simulations:** Skip the unplugged Getting Started activity. Students should complete the full lesson in Code Studio.
    * **Lesson 15 - Processing Arrays:** Skip the Getting Started Activity and Wrap up.
    * **Lesson 16 - Functions with Return Values:** - Skip the unplugged Getting Started activity.
    * **Lesson 17 - Building an App: Canvas Painter:** Students do not need to complete this project in order to prepare for the AP exam or Create PT. We recommend you save this for after the AP.
* **Post AP - Data Tools**
    * Chapter 1 content is not well-suited for students to complete independently. Consider using the [Data analysis](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/ap-computer-science-principles/data-analysis-101)  unit from Khan Academy to cover these learning objectives.
    * Chapter 2 content does not have lesson plans associated with it and can be completed asynchronously by students following the completion of the course

## Supporting Student Learning - Your role as the teacher

While the directions above will help you get content to your students in a virtual environment, it is also important to consider how you can support your students through this learning.  Doing this asynchronously means that students won’t have easy access to peers to collaborate with or a teacher to ask questions of.  We also know that not every student will have access to an adult who can help them with the content at home.  Your role is important in supporting student learning more than ever. 

Below are some ideas that you may be able to utilize depending on your own capacity and your district policies.

* Have dedicated office hours where you are on a  video call that students can drop into the call and ask questions. ([Zoom](https://zoom.us/docs/en-us/covid19.html), [Google Meet](https://gsuite.google.com/products/meet/), and [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/03/11/helping-teachers-students-switch-remote-learning/) all have free accounts available to schools during school closures)
* Use a scheduling system where students can sign-up for 5-10 minute calls with you during a limited section of time. 
* Set-up dedicated “programming buddies” or “groups” where they check in with one another each day. 
* Suggest students explain their problem to other siblings or family members - lots of times talking through it, even with someone who doesn’t know what you are talking about can be helpful.
* Have students fill out a daily reflection about what they did and what they are struggling with via google form or other technology tool.  Review the responses and reach out to students who need help.
* Set up a Google Voice account where students can text or call you.
* Set clear expectations for how students can contact you and what your response time is. 

Again, depending on your capacity and your district policies, these options may or may not work for your context. Consider what will work best for you and your students.

## Managing a Virtual Classroom on Code.org

The Code.org Teacher Dashboard allows you to view student progress, review student projects, and provide feedback. The following articles will be useful to review as you move to a virtual setting.

* [Viewing Student Progress](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/115000693231-Viewing-student-progress)
* [Assessing and checking student understanding in CS Discoveries and CS Principles](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/115002656691-Assessing-and-checking-student-understanding-in-CS-Discoveries-and-CS-Principles)
* [How do I leave feedback for my students?](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035582612-How-do-I-leave-feedback-for-my-students-CS-Discoveries-and-CS-Principles-only-)

## Supporting Instruction in Non-AP Classrooms

If you are using our CS Principles curriculum in a non-AP context many of the same recommendations should still help you teach our courses in a virtual environment. Many classrooms even assign the Create and Explore PTs as end-of-year projects. Consider whether virtual options for these projects will work in your classroom setting. You may also consider any number of virtual options listed at [code.org/athome](http://code.org/athome).

We also recommend you consider [CSTA's Resources to Support Teaching During COVID-19](https://csteachers.org/page/csta-compiled-resources-to-support-teaching-during-covid-19/) for an extensive set of options for continuing to teach computer science during school closures.

## Supporting Students with Limited Technology Access

We know many of our CS Principles students lack access to the internet or a laptop at home. The following resources are available for students lacking internet access, a laptop, or both, while they are continuing to study CS Principles from home.

* [Khan Academy's CS Principles course](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/ap-computer-science-principles) can be used on a smartphone. It can also be downloaded to a phone through a partnership with Learning Equality. More information [here](https://khanacademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202487370-How-can-I-use-Khan-Academy-without-an-internet-connection-).
* [Code.org's Video Library](https://code.org/educate/resources/videos) is viewable on a smartphone
* [Abstracting CS](https://www.abstractingcs.com/bits-bytes-resources-page/) has created a fully unplugged activity packet for CS Principles students
* The College Board has asked the community to help compile a list of resources, including [this list of non-programming resources](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WHtvxinAt_A-ld2FCopcrmZvFSqFG9sOiW6SvjOsRcE/edit?fbclid=IwAR2Li0vAIx_ziaqQP31TQMKTUYId-FIe_scORDcZxQEb26YL_RC10FJ0OAg#gid=0), some of which are also unplugged
