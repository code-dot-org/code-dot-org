# Volunteer Opportunities

Thank you for your interest in volunteering to inspire students about computer science! Below are the current volunteer opportunities:

- **[Volunteer in a Classroom during the Hour of Code](#hocvolunteer)**
	- Although most popular during Computer Science Education week in December, this is a year round opportunity
- **[Volunteer at TEALS](#teals)**

## <a name="hocvolunteer"></a>Sign up to volunteer
Anyone passionate about computer science education and careers in tech can be a volunteer. We want volunteers of all ages, backgrounds and experience levels who have a passion for increasing diversity in tech. The Hour of Code has a large variety of tutorials for all ages and skill levels so you don’t need to be an expert to volunteer!

Volunteers are most needed during the Hour of Code, but if you're also interested in a year-round commitment teachers are constantly looking for professionals and students alike to inspire their students. Sign up to volunteer at [code.org/volunteer](/volunteer).

The more information you provide, the more likely a teacher will contact you. It's also helpful if you:

* Add your company and use your company email. Your email address will never be shared.
* Select the checkbox to "I’m interested in volunteering year-round" if you want to volunteer throughout the year, outside of the Hour of Code. If you do not select this checkbox, you will only be displayed on the map during September-December for the Hour of Code.
* All professionals are welcome to volunteer! We want students to learn about all career paths in tech. Please provide a short description at the bottom of the form about your connection to computer science and careers in tech.

## Why volunteer?
Check out some testimony from past volunteers:

* “The best part of my experience was that the entire class were women and people of color. It bodes well for the future of our industry to have a chance to reach and excite these kids.”
* “Especially enjoyed getting to encourage young girls in technology. Felt like I was helping the next generation in my local area.”
* “I LOVED seeing how excited the kids were. One amazing thing was that the teachers noticed that some of the students who didn’t do as well academically were excelling at thinking like a developer and helping others are them - giving them a place to feel confident.”


## How you get selected:
* Teachers will be searching for volunteers on our [volunteer map](/volunteer/local) 
* Teachers will be reviewing your profiles on the map, so try to make your profile as complete as possible to increase the chance that a teacher will select you.
* A teacher will contact you through this form (your email address will never be shared with the teacher). 
	* If you are receiving too many requests from teachers, you can always update your preferences by clicking the link to edit your information or unsubscribe, provided at the bottom of any email from a teacher. 

## How to prepare: 
Try out tutorials before heading to the classroom by going to https://code.org/learn
Prepare an intro:
Get the students excited! Pick out a video to show to help focus the class and get them excited to do an Hour of Code.

* Watch this year's Volunteer Training [webinar](https://plus.google.com/events/ct1vlm9btosksrvlt7kggdoo0mk) and [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-SRpceNbw3c-BtGYXKC3tTw3JSJ-5OZg6Ay4XFh7h50/edit?usp=sharing)
* Check out the [Hour of Code Volunteer Toolkit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PcrOW44tq_leRIAUWeUDy-gdrLJGIUNBB_feXF8b9w0/edit?usp=sharing)
  * Includes an overview, timeline, preparation material, and marketing material. Everything you need to be ready for your volunteer experience!
* If you're going to be doing a tutorial during your session, spend 30 minutes trying at least one [Hour of Code tutorial](/learn)
* If you're visiting a school, complete any background checks or required paperwork
* [Review these tips](https://code.org/files/CSTT_Volunteers.pdf) about how to interact with students
* Prepare an intro:
	* Share an inspirational story: How you got involved in a career in tech or why tech is important to you
	* Get the students excited! Pick out a video to show to help focus the class and get them excited to do an Hour of Code.
* Join the conversation on FB, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr with #Hourofcode
* Connect with the teacher to discuss what you plan to speak about during your session
* If you are a virtual volunteer, test A/V and screen sharing capabilities beforehand

### **Day-of Hour of Code Event:**
* Sign into the school and greet the teacher. Confirm the agreed schedule for the day and discuss any talking points.
* Spend 5 minutes talking about yourself, who inspired you to pursue a career in tech and/or computer science.
	* Introduce yourself: who you are and what you do
	* Choose one inspirational video and show it to the entire classroom together. Answer any questions from students.
	* Share a short story about how you got interested in computer science. What or who inspired you? What do you love most about your job? Keep it short! ;) The point is to let the kids do the coding, leave time for more questions at the end.
	* Share how computer science has broad, worldwide impact.
* Let the students dive into the tutorials. Walk around the classroom answering any questions and guiding them through tough puzzles. Try not to give students the solution outright, instead try asking them questions so they can answer themselves what went wrong.
* Encourage students to ask each other if they have questions. Learning from each other is a great learning opportunity. Often kids can solve the problems themselves and through teamwork. 
* At the completion of their Hour of Code, hand out your company swag (stickers are awesome) and answer any remaining questions.
* Also important to mention that if you do take pictures/videos during the event -- especially with students -- that you get teacher/parent permission if you would like to post your stories on social media.
