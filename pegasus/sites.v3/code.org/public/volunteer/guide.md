# Volunteer Guide

Thank you for volunteering to inspire students about computer science. Here are some steps you can take in preparation for volunteering.

## How to prepare before you volunteer

1. Spend 30 minutes trying at least one [Hour of Code tutorial](/learn) to familiarize yourself with the material
1. If you're visiting a school, complete any background checks or required paperwork
1. [Review these tips](https://code.org/files/CSTT_Volunteers.pdf) about how to interact with students during your visit
1. Prepare a personal story about how you became passionate about computer science

## How to coordinate with a teacher in your area

1. Complete the sign up form at code.org/volunteer. The more information you provide, the more likely a teacher will contact you from the volunteer map.
1. When contacted by a teacher, reply to the email and share the following information:
	* Your name/company/job description 
	* Days and times you are available to volunteer
  * Why you chose to volunteer to inspire students
1. Ask if there is any paperwork you need to fill out before volunteering
1. Haven’t been contacted by a teacher yet? Search for local schools and call the principal/teacher/front office and ask how you can help.
1. It is your responsibility to work with the teacher to find a day/time to volunteer and to complete all necessary school paperwork. Code.org does not have capacity to handle these requests. 
1. Before arriving at the school, you should:
  * Complete all school forms, including a background check, necessary for outside volunteers
  * Confirm with your teacher the day and time you will be at the school
  * Establish clear expectations with the teacher how you will support their classroom’s Hour of Code. Emphasize your role as an inspirational mentor, not just technical help for the classroom.

## What to do during your classroom visit, step-by-step
1. Sign into the school and greet the teacher. Confirm the agreed schedule for the day and discuss any talking points.
1. Spend 5 minutes talking about computer science.
1. Introduce yourself: who you are and what you do
1. Choose [one inspirational video](/inspire) and show it to the entire classroom together. Answer any questions from students.
1. Share a short story about how you got interested in computer science. What or who inspired you? What do you love most about your job? Keep it short! ;) The point is to let the kids do the coding, leave time for more questions at the end. Share how computer science has broad, worldwide impact.
1. Let the students dive into the tutorials. Walk around the classroom answering any questions and guiding them through tough puzzles. Try not to give students the solution outright, instead try asking them questions so they can answer themselves what went wrong.
1. Encourage students to ask each other if they have questions. Learning from each other is a great learning opportunity.
1. At the completion of their Hour of Code, hand out your company swag (stickers are awesome) and answer any remaining questions.
1. Also important to mention that if you do take pictures/videos during the event -- especially with students -- that you get teacher/parent permission if you would like to post your stories on social media.
