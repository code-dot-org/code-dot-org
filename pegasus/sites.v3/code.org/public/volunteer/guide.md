# Volunteer Guide

Thank you for your interest in volunteering to inspire students about computer science. Here are some steps you can take in preparation for volunteering.

## 1. Sign up to volunteer
If you are a software engineer, CS student, or just someone passionate about CS education, join the more than 12,000 volunteers who have signed up to volunteer with Code.org. Volunteers are most needed during the Hour of Code, but if you're also interested in a year-round commitment teachers are constantly looking for professionals and students alike to inspire their students. Sign up to volunteer at [code.org/volunteer](/volunteer).

The more information you provide, the more likely a teacher will contact you. It's also helpful if you:

* Add your company and use your company email. Your email address will never be shared.
* Select the checkbox to "I’m interested in volunteering year-round" if you want to volunteer throughout the year, outside of the Hour of Code. If you do not select this checkbox, you will only be displayed on the map during September-December for the Hour of Code.
* All professionals are welcome to volunteer! We want students to learn about all career paths in tech. Please provide a short description at the bottom of the form about your connection to computer science and careers in tech.

### Volunteer at TEALS

If you are a software engineer who is available for a bigger commitment, consider volunteering with TEALS. [TEALS](http://c.tealsk12.org/l/667) (Technology Education and Literacy in Schools) brings together hundreds of software engineers and teachers to help build sustainable CS classes across the country. You can make an impact in local schools by helping teachers teach Intro and AP CS classes 2 days a week.

## 2. Connect with a teacher and confirm
Teachers will search for volunteers through our [volunteer map](/volunteer/local). When you get an email from a teacher, reply to the email and share the following information:

* Your name/company/job description 
* Days and times you are available to volunteer
* Why you chose to volunteer to inspire students
* Ask if there is any paperwork you need to fill out before volunteering

## 3. How to prepare before you volunteer

* Listen to a pre-recorded Volunteer Training webinar

* [Review these tips](https://code.org/files/CSTT_Volunteers.pdf) about how to interact with students
