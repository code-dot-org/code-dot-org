# Volunteer Guide

Thank you for your interest in volunteering to inspire students about computer science. Here are some steps you can take in preparation for volunteering.

## 1. Sign up to volunteer
Sign up at [code.org/volunteer](/volunteer). The more information you provide, the more likely a teacher will contact you. It's also helpful if you:

* Add your company and use your company email. Your email address will never be shared.
* Select the checkbox to "Iâ€™m interested in volunteering year-round" if you want to volunteer throughout the year, outside of the Hour of Code. If you do not select this checkbox, you will only be displayed on the map during September-December for the Hour of Code.
* All professionals are welcome to volunteer! We want students to learn about all career paths in tech. Please provide a short description at the bottom of the form about your connection to computer science and careers in tech.

## 2. Connect with a teacher and confirm
Teachers will search for volunteers through our [volunteer map](/volunteer/local). When you get an email from a teacher, reply to the email and share the following information:

* Your name/company/job description 
* Days and times you are available to volunteer
* Why you chose to volunteer to inspire students
* Ask if there is any paperwork you need to fill out before volunteering

## 3. How to prepare before you volunteer

* Listen to a pre-recorded Volunteer Training webinar

* [Review these tips](https://code.org/files/CSTT_Volunteers.pdf) about how to interact with students
