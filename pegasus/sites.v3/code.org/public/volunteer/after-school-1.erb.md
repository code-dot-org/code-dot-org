# Start a computer science club!

Do you enjoy learning new technology and want to volunteer to help bring computer science to students in your local area? If your school doesn't offer computer science yet, you can start an after school club by partnering with your local Boys and Girls Club, school, community center or other organization. 

We provide all the curriculum, lesson plans, and materials at no cost. You will need a meeting space, an internet connection and access to computers or tablets for the students. [Read more](/volunteer/after-school-3) about what you'll need to run your club.
