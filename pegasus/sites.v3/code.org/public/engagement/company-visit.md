Help break stereotypes about computer science careers by inspiring students with the opportunities in your own company. Work with a local high school teacher to plan a field trip for students to visit your company.

## Steps:

1. **Connect with a local high school.** If your office is located [near one of our regional partners](https://code.org/educate/regional-partner/partners), we can put you in touch - contact donate@code.org. Companies have also found that employees may want to arrange these activities with their children’s school - check out this [suggested messaging](#messaging).
1. **Recruit volunteers.** Find a diverse group of enthusiastic volunteers who can help show high school students different options for tech careers. They do not all have to be engineers! In fact, it’s great to show all the ways people can use computer science backgrounds in design, usability testing, product management, and other fields.
1. **Plan the visit.** You’ll want to give the students a chance to see what technical careers look like from day to day and participate in a hands on project. See our [suggested itinerary](#itinerary).
1. **Celebrate.** Students love stickers, swag, or other handouts. Give them opportunities to take photos to share with their friends. Share your Careers in Tech experience with your employees and on social media to inspire others. (Note: Check with the school first to see if you can take and/or share photos of students.)

## Suggested itinerary

The best career visits allow students to participate in an interactive project that gives them a sense of something you do in the office. Having a chance to meet engineers and ask questions is interesting, but just listening to talks from adults won’t hold their attention as well as an activity will. We recommend planning a half day at your office so they can see a variety of activities. Don’t forget to offer food! Students love pizza, cookies, and other treats.

| Duration | Description |
|-------- | -------- |
| 15-30 min | **Tour of the office.** Some students think all computer scientists work by themselves. Make sure to point out collaborative spaces and how people in your organization work together.  |
| 50 min | **Interactive activity related to something you work on.** <br>Examples: <ul><li>A product manager can explain how you do customer research and ask the students to brainstorm new feature ideas and describe the customer / scenario for each</li><li>An engineer can explain how they think about testing and have the students help brainstorm interesting test cases for a new feature you’re shipping</li><li>A designer can explain how they made style decisions while creating a mock-up or graphic with the students</li></ul> |
| 10 min | **Break.** Give students a quick break to grab some water, use the restroom, and talk among themselves about the activity they just did.  |
| 60 min | **Lightning talks from different employees.** This is a great way to increase participation and have lots of different people who work at your organization join the event. A number of short talks will also be more engaging for the students and lets them see the diversity of opportunities. Employees can each share for 5 minutes: <ul><li>What’s the most exciting thing they are working on?</li><li>How do they use computer science in their job?</li><li>What’s a challenge they had to overcome?</li></ul> |
| 60 min | **Lunch!** Let the students socialize informally with the employees they met, ask questions, and learn more about what a career in tech looks like. |
| 15 min | **Celebrate.** Hand out stickers, t-shirts, or other company swag. Give the students an opportunity to take photos of the office and employees they met.  |

Subject: [Company] is hosting a career day!

Dear [Name],

Software and technology are everywhere - in our computers, pockets, cars, and used in agriculture, communications, entertainment, transportation, and science. But very few students are learning how to actually create technology.

[Company] is dedicated to giving back to our local communities and believes computer science education is crucial in order to succeed in a 21st century job market. We would love to offer your students the opportunity to visit our office to see how having a tech background can help in any field--not just engineering. Our employees are passionate about the work they do and can provide your students with insights into how computer science is used in their diverse career fields.

I would love to set up a meeting to discuss this opportunity for your students. Please let me know if there is a time in the next week to connect.

Thank you for considering bringing these life-changing skills to our children! I look forward to hearing from you.

Best,
<br>SIGNED
