## I'm a teacher...
### How can I bring computer science to my school?
The easiest way to start is to try our 20-hour [K-8 Intro to Computer Science course](http://code.org/educate/20hr) with your students. It’s 100% free, self-serve, and combines online and group activities. Or, [ask your district to partner](http://code.org/educate/districts) with us to bring computer science classes to your school. Professional development for teachers is coming soon.

### You Tube Education is blocked at my school. How can I access the videos? 
We’ve made all our videos available for download. You can download ALL the videos in one fell swoop [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/aax85b3850olxcx/mso9d17QtH), to project on a shared screen.

Or, integrated into our tutorials, we’ve added a green download link for each video, allowing students to download individual tutorials. If all fails, there is a “Show Notes” tab that provides a storyboard equivalent of the video.

### I need help teaching Code.org’s 20-hour curriculum.
Code.org will be hosting free, online professional development sessions for our [K-8 Intro to Computer Science course](http://code.org/educate/20hr) via Google Hangout on Air. The first set of sessions will be in January 2014, and we will host similar sessions in the following weeks. Visit <http://code.org/educate/20hr> for list of future sessions or view past sessions.

### Why don’t you award classroom funding prizes to private schools?
We would love to help teachers in public and private schools alike, but at this time, it comes down to logistics. We have partnered with DonorsChoose.org to administer classroom funding prizes, which only works with public, U.S. K-12 schools. According to DonorsChoose.org, the organization is better able to access consistent and accurate data that's available for public schools.

### Why does Code.org use DonorsChoose.org for prizes?
Due to a small full-time staff, Code.org is unable to administer a secure class rewards systems ourselves. We outsource our prize money through DonorsChoose.org due to their efficient, secure and transparent school verification process and allotment of funding.

<a id="outside_us"></a>
## I'm outside the US...
### How do I bring computer science to my country? 
The easiest way to start is to [try an Hour of Code](http://code.org/educate/hoc) in your community or local school. Then, go onto our 20-hour [K-8 Intro to Computer Science course](http://code.org/educate/20hr) with students. It’s 100% free, self-serve, and combines online and group activities. 

### Can I help translate your materials into a foreign language?
All of our translations have been crowdsourced by volunteers. Please [sign up here](http://eepurl.com/Im_In) to volunteer as a translator. You can also visit [this page](http://code.org/translate) for tips on submitting quality translations and a demo video of how to use the CrowdIn platform. You can get started right away by creating an account at CrowdIn and submitting translations to our [Code.org project](http://crowdin.net/project/codeorg/invite).

### Are your videos/curriculum available in other languages?
We have made subtitles available for videos/curriculum in many languages. If you mouse over the video while it plays, click on the "CC" in the lower right corner, you can activate subtitles by selecting a language. In the footer of Code.org’s website, you will also find a menu to change our site to one of over 30 languages. 

### Will the K-8 Intro to Computer Science course be available in non-English languages?
For now, only the online portion of the K-8 course is available in non-English languages. It is currently available in over 30 languages. Unplugged, teacher-led activities are available only in English, but we may translate them in the future.

### How do I sign up my students?
Sign up your students by doing one of these two options:

**Option A:** Create a section for your classroom on the [“Add Section” page](http://learn.code.org/sections/new), and once you click "Create Section" you'll be able to see the section-code. Tell all students in that section to visit the [“Join” page](http://learn.code.org/join) and enter the section-code. Then each student will sign up by creating a username and password. **Students do NOT need an email address for this sign-up option.**

**Option B:** Students can create their own account at the [“Student sign up” page](http://learn.code.org/users/sign_up). Once students are signed in, they can enter a teacher’s email address or section-code (see instructions above on creating a section-code). **Students MUST have an email address for this sign-up option.**

### I accidentally signed up for a student account. How do I change it to a teacher account?
We're working on a solution to this, but in the meantime here's what you could do: 

1. Change your account's email to a secondary email address. If you have gmail or your email uses gmail apps, you can add "+1" to the username for example katie+1@gmail.com to create unique email addresses.
2. Create a new teacher account at the [teacher sign-up page](http://learn.code.org/users/sign_up?user%5Buser_type%5D=teacher) using the desired email address.

### When did the Donorschoose.org Prize Promotion end?

The Donorschoose.org Prize Promotion ended of June 15, 2014. We’ve given away all of our Donorschoose.org prizes to teachers who successfully lead 15 or more students through our K-8 Intro to Computer Science Course. We hope it served as a “Thank you” to teachers who were early adopters to trying out our new course.

This was a one-time campaign to see if rewards can help grow the pool of C.S. teachers and increase total enrollment (especially by girls). Our expectation was that teachers who have a good experience integrating this course into the classroom will offer it on an ongoing basis.

We’ve had a great partnership with Donorschoose.org for this promotion, but we do not have any similar promotions planned at this time. Donorschoose.org has played an important role in helping Code.org’s mission of bringing Computer Science to K-12 public schools. While Code.org’s [mission](http://code.org/about) is focused on K-12 public schools, we do support everyone learning more about computer science, which is why we offer all of our materials (in 35+ languages) for free on our website under [Creative Commons license](http://code.org/tos).

We thank you so much for your interest in our materials, and we hope you continue to enjoy using them!

### How do I delete a student from my teacher view?
Click “Remove Student” under the “Manage Students” link. This does not delete their profile, but removes them as your teacher. 

###  Why does the "password reset" link appear next to some student names in teacher view, but is missing from others?
If your students signed up through code.org/join (which is the sign-up option that does not require an email address) you are able to edit their passwords in your teacher account under the “Manage Students” link: http://learn.code.org/followers/manage

If your students signed up with their own email addresses or signed up through code.org/join and then added their email address in account settings, then you're not able to reset their password.

We're working on changing this so that a teacher is able to edit a student's password no matter if there is an email associated with that student account or not.

### Am I supposed to use the same course for all grades K-8?
For now, we only have one offering for grades K-8. Later in 2014, we will have offerings specified for grades K-2, 3-5, and 6-8.

### Why doesn’t it display the right answer when you get a puzzle wrong? 
We’re going to be improving our error messages, but part of learning to program is being able to identify the mistakes you’ve made. This is an important skill that we want students to get practice with.

### One of my students forgot their username. Is there a way for me to get their username?
Go to "manage students" and click on the student's name who forgot their username. Scroll down to the bottom of that page, and you'll be able to see their username. 

### How do I suggest changes you should make to your materials?
Please suggest changes at our [support center](http://support.code.org/). Please specify your device, operating system, and browser with version number. For example, Dell Laptop, Windows 7, Internet Explorer 9.
