Either encourage all your teachers to attend and start teaching, or we can set up a workshop for librarians and tech teachers. (If you only have one or two teachers, encourage them to join a local workshop in your area.)</br>

* Our CS Fundamentals courses are designed to be taught once a week in elementary schools. They align to ISTE, Common Core and CSTA standards.

### Professional Learning
