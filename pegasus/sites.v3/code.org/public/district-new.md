## Get started with curriculum and professional learning

<div class="col-50" style="padding-right: 20px">

<strong><h3>Grades K-5</h3></strong>
<br>
<a href="/educate/professional-learning/cs-fundamentals-directory"><button>Contact a Facilitator</button></a>

<br>
<br>
Contact our local K5 Facilitators to run a free workshops for for elementary school teachers in your district. Either encourage all your teachers to attend and start teaching, or we can set up a workshop for librarians and tech teachers. (If you only have one or two teachers, encourage them to join a local workshop in your area.)

<br>
<br>
Our CS Fundamentals courses are designed to be taught once a week in elementary schools. They align to ISTE, Common Core and CSTA standards.

### Free Curriculum

Implement stand alone computer science courses in middle and high school.  These high quality, full year, courses (including daily lesson plans, detailed instructions, activity guides, assessments, and standards mappings) are free for any school or teacher to use.

Have a teacher who’s taught computer science before? Have them pick-up the curriculum and start teaching the course today!

### Professional Learning

Our network of regional partners work directly with teachers new to computer science to prepare them to successfully lead computer science classrooms.  Sign up to connect with your local partner and learn more!

## Start Planning Now 

### Identify a district lead for computer science

- Show that your district is serious about computer science by identifying or appointing a district lead.
- Often Math, Science or CTE departments have staff who are already working on computer science education and programs. 
- If there is enough momentum behind computer science in your district or if there is not already an owner you should consider adding a dedicated position.
- This person will lead the district's work on computer science and be your point of contact with Code.org’s Regional Partner.

### Make computer science courses count!

- How you credit computer science can dramatically impact [who enrolls in computer science courses](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://blog.code.org/post/121123281798/md&sa=D&ust=1503429211525000&usg=AFQjCNGbt8TOF423vE4k2IeeeLdM__wZuw).
- 33 states allow computer science [to satisfy graduation requirements](/promote).
- If possible, we recommend allowing computer science courses to satisfy graduation requirements and exist as both an Academic and CTE course.

### Understand teacher certification requirements 

- Identify teachers who will lead CS classes in your district next year.
- Our curriculum and professional development is designed for teachers from other subjects to become computer science teachers.  As you identify potential future computer science teachers in your district, it’s important to understand what, if any, requirements your state has in place for computer science teachers.
- 29 States have some guidance around certification for computer science teachers, [find your state here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YtTVcpQXoZz0IchihwGOihaCNeqCz2HyLwaXYpyb2SQ/pubhtml#).

### Spread the word!

- Highlight the importance of all students learning CS! Use these [sample emails and announcements](https://code.org/educate/resources/recruit#blurbs) to let your community know about your new CS programs.
- Add [these recruitment videos](/educate/resources/recruit#videos) to websites and school updates.
- Provide guidance to school counselors and schedulers on why computer science is important for all students.

### Allocate funding

- Thanks to the generous support of our funders, all curricular resources from Code.org are free for anyone to use.  However, there are still costs to consider when starting a computer science program.  You should begin thinking about how you’ll support:
	- **Professional development costs** - Our courses are designed to be taught by teachers new to computer science. This means you do not have to increase your FTE budget or hire additional teachers to support computer science, but may have to cover costs for professional development.
	- **Computers and internet access** - In order to teach our 6-12 courses students will need to be in a 1:1 computing environment every class period.
	- **Classroom supplies** -  Our courses are hands on, and standard classroom materials.  We estimate these costs to be less than $100 per 30 students.
	- **Administrative support** - As your computer science program grows, there will need to be additional administrative support. We recommend dedicating at least .15 FTE to this initiative to start, and growing up to 1 FTE per 30 teachers offering computer science in the district.

## Curriculum Options

### Code.org Programs
Code.org has curriculum and professional learning for grades K-12. The three courses offerred are: 

- Computer Science Fudamentals
- Computer Science Discoveries
- Computer Science Principles

### AP Computer Science A Resources
There are two AP computer science offerings, and students can take either course in any order. The AP Computer Science A course and exam focuses on computing skills related to programming in Java. The new AP Computer Science Principles course complements AP Computer Science A as it aims to broaden participation in the study of computer science.

While Code.org does not have an AP Computer Science A curriculum, we have recommendations for a number of great curricula and programs available to teacher and students.
