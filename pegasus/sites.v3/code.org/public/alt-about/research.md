<p>A growing body of evidence supports the idea that learning computer science helps students far beyond the direct benefits of digital literacy or careers in tech. Recent research demonstrates that a good computer science education can increase reading comprehension and improve students’ problem-solving and planning skills. Students who take CS in high school are likelier to enroll in college, and students who major in CS are among the highest paying university graduates, earning <a href="http://www.hamiltonproject.org/charts/career_earnings_by_college_major/">40% more than average university graduates</a>.</p>
<p>The research, program evaluations, and case studies listed on this page measure and evaluate the effectiveness of Code.org programs, including course content, student progress, professional development for teachers, district implementation, and the Hour of Code.</p>

<h3><strong><a href="http://www.westcoastanalytics.com/uploads/6/9/6/7/69675515/longitudinal_study_-_combined_report_final_3_10_20__jgq_.pdf">The Effect of Advanced Placement Computer Science Course Taking on College Enrollment</a></strong></h3>
<p>This study provides estimates of the impact of AP Computer Science course taking on students’ college enrollment, relative to students not participating in the program from the same schools, controlling for student academic achievement and background characteristics. We find that taking AP computer science courses has a positive and significant effect on increasing the likelihood of enrolling in college, despite the fact that very few students in either district took an AP Computer Science course in high school.</p>

<p>In a cluster-randomized controlled trial, Arfé, Vardanega, and Ronconi examined how 1st-grade children's gains in coding skills that follow instructional intervention transfer to two important executive functions (EFs): planning and response inhibition. The results show that practice with coding through Code.org not only improved measurably children's ability to solve coding problems, but also their EFs, increasing the time children spent planning, their ability to solve standardized planning tasks, and to inhibit prepotent responses.</p>

<p>Findings show that after completing one Hour of Code activity students report liking computer science more, feel that they are better able to learn computer science, and are better at computer science than their peers. These study results suggest that simple exposure to computer science, with the right activity, may be a critical first step to engage more students—especially girls, in computer science.</p>

<h3><strong><a href="https://code.org/files/EvaluationReport2015-16.pdf">Evaluation Summary Report 2015-2016</a></strong></h3>
<p>Code.org’s elementary, middle, and high School programs for teachers and students are evaluated with the following three questions in mind: What impact does Code.org professional development and use of Code.org curricula have on teachers? What impact does Code.org curriculum have on student proficiency and learning of computer science? Is teacher and student participation in Code.org programs associated with changes in their attitudes toward and self-efficacy with computer science?</p>

How successful have our district partnerships been in driving short- and long-term outcomes in each region? What learning outcomes have Code.org students achieved? How much do Code.org programs cost? How does learning Computer Science impact learning other subjects? What next steps can Code.org take to improve our programs?</p>

## Case Studies
<p>Code.org has partnered with a number of districts across the US to develop implementation plans for bringing CS to schools district-wide and to offer professional development to teachers. Although we no longer partner directly with school districts, we do offer partnerships through our Regional Partners. Regional Partners are K-12 computer science hubs for their regions, offering professional learning opportunities for teachers, collaborating on implementation plans, and building strong local communities. To learn more, visit our <a href="https://code.org/educate/regional-partner">Regional Partner Program page</a> or <a href="https://code.org/educate/professional-learning/contact-regional-partner">connect directly with your local Regional Partner</a>.</p>
