# Translating Sports Tutorials
This page outlines how to translate the [Make a basketball game](https://studio.code.org/s/basketball) and [Mix and match across sports](https://studio.code.org/s/sports) tutorials.

They are both free to join and any volunteer can immediately start translating on either platform.
