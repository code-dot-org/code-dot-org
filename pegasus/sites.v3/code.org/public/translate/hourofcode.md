# Translating the Hour of Code
The majority of our translations are done through CrowdIn, a localization management platform. It is free to join and any volunteer can immediately contribute to the project by providing translations. There are currently three projects open for translations:

* [Code.org Project](https://crowdin.com/project/codeorg) - For the Code.org site and all Code Studio tutorials. Learn more [here](https://code.org/translate/tutorials).
* [Hour of Code Project](https://crowdin.com/project/hour-of-code) - For the HourofCode.com site. Learn more below.
* [Curriculum Project](https://crowdin.com/project/lesson-plans) - For teacher lesson plans that accompany our courses. Learn more [here](https://code.org/translate/curriculum).

Please complete translations for these projects in the above order of priority. If you have completed translations (at least 75% of the project is complete) and do not see your language in the drop down menu, please send a report to translations@code.org.

## What do I translate first?
1. hourofcode.com homepage
2. resources.md
3. all markdown files in /resources folder
4. remaining markdown files
5. 2015 Signup Email in /emails folder
6. Posters and brochures in /files folder


## Where can I find context for translations?
All of the markdown files are the same as the URL path. For example, you can find the context for resources.md at [hourofcode.com/resources](https://hourofcode.com/resources). Also, you can find anything in the resources tab, like the stats page, at: [hourofcode.com/resources/stats](https://hourofcode.com/resources/stats). The country resources page will only be visible for all non-US sites, i.e. [hourofcode.com/uk/resources/country-resources](https://hourofcode.com/uk/resources/country-resources).

The files folder contains the text for the [one pager](https://hourofcode.com/files/hoc-one-pager.pdf), [brochure](https://hourofcode.com/files/schools-handout.pdf), and [posters](hourofcode.com/resources#posters).

## Strings that may still change

As we prepare for the Hour of Code, we may change messaging every few weeks. For example, we will focus on gathering signups for the first few months, then during the Hour of Code direct people to the tutorials. Please complete the project and check in every week for small changes to strings that may need re-translating.


## How translations are selected

Members of the project are either a translator or proofreader. A translator can provide translations, while a proofreader can both provide translations as well as select the best translation to be used on the site.

The final translation that appears on our site is selected as follows:

1. A proofreader selects the best translation.
2. If there is no translation selected by a proofreader, translators vote on the best translation and the translation with the most votes is selected.
3. if votes are tied, the most recent translation will be selected.
