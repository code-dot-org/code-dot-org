# Translating the Hour of Code
The majority of our translations are done through CrowdIn, a localization management platform. It is free to join and any volunteer can immediately contribute to the project by providing translations. There are currently three projects open for translations:

* [Code.org Project](https://crowdin.com/project/codeorg) - For the Code.org site and all Code Studio tutorials. Learn more [here](https://code.org/translate/tutorials).
* [Hour of Code Project](https://crowdin.com/project/hour-of-code) - For the HourofCode.com site. Learn more below.
* [Curriculum Project](https://crowdin.com/project/lesson-plans) - For teacher lesson plans that accompany our courses. Learn more [here](https://code.org/translate/curriculum).

Please complete translations for these projects in the above order of priority. If you have completed translations (at least 75% of the project is complete) and do not see your language in the drop down menu, please send a report to translations@code.org.

## What do I translate first?
1. Please translate our [Star Wars tutorial](/translate/starwars) and our [Minecraft tutorial](/translate/mc) first.
1. Then in the [Hour of Code Project](https://crowdin.com/project/hour-of-code), complete in the following order:
  * hourofcode.com homepage
  * thanks.md
  * everything in how-to folder
  * everything in prizes folder
  * everything in promote folder

## Where can I find context for translations?
All of the markdown files are the same as the URL path. For example, you can find the context for promote/index.md at [hourofcode.com/promote](https://hourofcode.com/promote). The country resources page will only be visible for all non-US sites, i.e. [hourofcode.com/uk/promote/country-resources](https://hourofcode.com/uk/promote/country-resources).

The files folder contains the text for handouts and posters. The pdfs are not automatically generated, we are only collecting translations and hope to convert into pdfs soon. If you can manually localize and create these resources, please email translations@code.org for the complete assets.

## Strings that may still change

As we prepare for the Hour of Code, we may change messaging every few weeks. For example, we will focus on gathering signups for the first few months, then during the Hour of Code direct people to the tutorials. Please complete the project and check in every week for small changes to strings that may need re-translating.


## How translations are selected

Members of the project are either a translator or proofreader. A translator can provide translations, while a proofreader can both provide translations as well as select the best translation to be used on the site.

The final translation that appears on our site is selected as follows:

1. A proofreader selects the best translation.
2. If there is no translation selected by a proofreader, translators vote on the best translation and the translation with the most votes is selected.
3. if votes are tied, the most recent translation will be selected.
