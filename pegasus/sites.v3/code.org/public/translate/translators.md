## Be a Lead Translator
If you'd like to be a lead translator, please e-mail translations@code.org with your name, language, and credentials. A lead translator will be the first point of contact when we need something translated immediately. We ask that you translate regularly, as we update the site constantly. The commitment is about 5-10 hours per week.
