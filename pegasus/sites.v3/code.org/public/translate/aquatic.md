1. [Video notes](https://crowdin.com/translate/codeorg/all/enus-af#q=https%3A%2F%2Fstudio.code.org%2Fs%2Fcoursee-2019%2Fstage%2F3%2Fpuzzle%2F) - These notes are basically a copy of the video captions. They are shown on the second tab, alongside screenshots from the video. These are intended for slow internet users. Since it is very close to the captions, we suggest completing the translation for the video captions on Amara (see below) and then reusing those translations here.

## Translating the video captions

1. To use Amara, first click on a video link below.
1. On the left, you'll see a list of languages. If you don't see your language listed, click "Add a new language". A language with a yellow dot means it's been started but incomplete; please go ahead and complete the translation. A language with a green dot means it's been completed and published.
1. When you begin you'll see the English track on the left and you can enter your translations on the right. Feel free to edit the timing if necessary. When complete, click the Publish button in the top right.
1. The links for the videos are below:
