Alternatives to the College Pathway

[/solid-block-header]

Heading straight to university isn’t for everyone. If you aren’t planning on attending college, there are still ways to begin a meaningful career in computer science. 

###  Continue your learning with these partners:
- [Lambda school](https://lambdaschool.com/code-org/?clickid=WwT36g1nlxyJR4n0EkzjZTwgUklzL-X9W1lFWE0&irgwc=1&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=1409860&utm_source=impact)  trains people online to be software engineers at no up-front cost. Instead of paying tuition, students can agree to pay a percentage of their income after they're employed, and only if they're making more than $50k per year. If you don't find a job, or don't reach that level of income, you'll never pay a cent.
- [Take a 12-week course at a local university](https://www.trilogyed.com/)  through Trilogy. Dozens of Universities such as University of Washington, UCLA, or UPenn offer 12-week full-time or part-time courses in web development, data, design, or cybersecurity.
- Based in San Francisco, [MAKE School](https://www.makeschool.com/) is designed in partnership with top tech companies and offers a degree program that is regionally accredited by WASC. Make School teaches a combination of liberal arts, civics, and computer science, and students can choose to pay tuition as a percent of earnings once they get a job. Tuition for the full two-year program is $70,000.
- [CodePath.org](http://codepath.org/) provides college students from underrepresented backgrounds with industry-relevant technical training, along with the mentoring and networking support needed to not only land jobs, but to thrive at leading tech companies. This summer, students pursuing CS majors are invited to join their free, 12-week, [Technical Interview Prep Course](https://codepath.org/classes/interviewprep?utm_source=email&utm_campaign=codeorg). Students will learn how to ace the technical interview and land their dream job!


### Offerings available from our donors:
- [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/). Use this summer to continue your learning with Pluralsight One’s course library, available for [free to Code.org classroom students](https://code.org/pluralsight) for a year if they sign up by **June 30th**. Curated by expert technologists, the library features over 150 courses totaling over 500 hours of content across four major areas: IT/OPs, software development, design/creative, and product management. A personal plan begins at $35/month. 
- [AWS Educate Cloud Skills Badges](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/code-org/).
