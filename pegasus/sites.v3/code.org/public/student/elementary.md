## CS Fundamentals: Courses A-F

Try learning an introduction to computer science with our CS Fundamentals courses. You can use any of these courses without a teacher. Start with the course based on your grade level. If it's too challenging, try the earlier course or if you want even more practice try the next course.

Lessons also teach students to collaborate with others meaningfully, investigate different problem-solving techniques, persist in the face of difficult tasks, and learn about internet safety. At the end of this course, students create their very own custom game or story they can share.

Covers the basics of programming, collaboration techniques, investigation and critical thinking skills, persistence in the face of difficulty, and internet safety. At the end of this course, students create their very own custom game they can share.'%>

They will translate their initials into binary, investigate different problem-solving techniques, and discuss how to respond to cyberbullying. By the end of the course, students will create interactive games that they can share.'%>

CS Fundamentals Express combines the best of Courses A-F into a single condensed course (with a simpler option for pre-readers). We recommend Courses A-F for most classrooms, but if your school only offers one computer science course or you want to have your students work through multiple courses in a single year, the Express course is a better choice. By removing the ramp up between years, the express course provides a smoother path and doesnâ€™t repeat concepts for students. This is also our recommended option for students studying computer science on their own, outside of a classroom.

## Looking for courses in other languages?

We are working on translating Courses A-F and the Express Course to languages beyond English. In the meantime, we recommend using [Courses 1-4 and the Accelerated Course](/educate/curriculum/cs-fundamentals-international). These courses cover the same basic concepts and have already been translated into 25+ languages.
