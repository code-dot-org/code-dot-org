CS Fundamentals Express combines the best of Courses A-F into a single condensed course (with a simpler option for pre-readers). We recommend Courses A-F for most classrooms, but if your school only offers one computer science course or you want to have your students work through multiple courses in a single year, the Express course is a better choice. By removing the ramp up between years, the express course provides a smoother path and doesnâ€™t repeat concepts for students. This is also our recommended option for students studying computer science on their own, outside of a classroom.

## Create apps, animations, games, or websites

In addition to our courses, teachers can use tools to teach students how to create apps, animations, games, or websites. We also have lessons and widgets to teach encryption, text compression, and other computer science concepts. Browse our other resources to inspire students with posters, videos, or by inviting guest speakers.
