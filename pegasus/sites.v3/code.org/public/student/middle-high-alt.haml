%h2 Discovering Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
%br/
The CS Discoveries curriculum features a <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/csd7-2021" target="_blank">standalone module</a> on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), which can be taught on its own or as a part of your CS curriculum. As these technologies touch more and more of our daily lives, they have become an essential part of foundational computer science education. The module focuses on AI ethics, examines issues of bias, and explores and explains fundamental concepts through a number of online and unplugged activities and full-group discussions.
