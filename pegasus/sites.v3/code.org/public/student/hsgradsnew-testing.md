#  Computer Science Beyond High School

While Code.org doesn’t offer post-secondary courses, we encourage students to consider opportunities our partners and generous donors are providing to take your love of computer science beyond graduation.



Choosing your career path and program



<a id="careerpath"></a>
**Choosing a career path** <br>
You can jumpstart your career in tech by majoring in a field of computer science at college or finishing a certificate program. Look at programs such as computer science, information technology, information systems, data science, application programming, etc. 

- [Tech Prep by Facebook](https://techprep.org/why/): Explore careers in programming through interviews, industry comparisons, and more
- [Careers in Tech](https://code.org/careers-in-tech): Learn more through video interviews with professionals working at some of the leading tech companies
- Review [salary and job prospects for different careers](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/home.htm) at the US Bureau of Labor Statistics
- Learn more about [which degree programs can set up you for the job you want](https://www.ncwit.org/resources/university-pathway-it-and-computing-careers/university-pathway-it-and-computing-careers) with this study from The National Center for Women & Informational Technology (NCWIT) and connect with college students on [College Confidential](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/college-majors/) to ask questions about college majors.
- If you’re interested in applying CS in another field, there are lots of opportunities for blended career paths. Look at options such as computational biology, business and tech, or CS and design (Human Computer Interaction majors) Get your questions, about any role or industry, answered by real professionals on Career Village

Not sure about studying computer science? Try a course! No matter what you end up studying, CS is a useful skill to have these days. If you’re in college learn more about what your school offers by signing up for an introductory course in computer science. Or, if you’re not in school, take a [free online course](#).



Alternatives to the College Pathway



<a id="alternatives"></a>
Heading straight to university isn’t for everyone. If you aren’t planning on attending college, there are still ways to begin a meaningful career in computer science. 

###  Continue your learning with these partners:
- [Lambda school](https://lambdaschool.com/code-org/?clickid=WwT36g1nlxyJR4n0EkzjZTwgUklzL-X9W1lFWE0&irgwc=1&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=1409860&utm_source=impact) trains people online to be software engineers at no up-front cost. Instead of paying tuition, students can agree to pay a percentage of their income after they're employed, and only if they're making more than $50k per year. If you don't find a job, or don't reach that level of income, you'll never pay a cent.
- [Enroll in a skills-based boot camp](https://www.trilogyed.com/students/?utm_source=mkt-partnership&utm_campaign=trilogyed-students&utm_term=codeorg&utm_content=hsgrads) powered by Trilogy Education.
