A great option for students getting started on their own. You'll learn the fundamentals of computer science with drag & drop blocks. Create your own drawings and games. Note: Express courses are currently only available in English, Hindi, Italian, and Spanish. For other languages, we recommend our 20-hour
%a{href: CDO.studio_url('/s/20-hour')} Accelerated Course.
