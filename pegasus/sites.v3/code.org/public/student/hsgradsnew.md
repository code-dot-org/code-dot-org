Choosing your career path and program

[/solid-block-header]

### Choosing a career path
You can jumpstart your career in tech by majoring in a field of computer science at college or finishing a certificate program. Look at programs such as computer science, information technology, information systems, data science, application programming, etc. <br>

Alternatives to the college pathway

[/solid-block-header]

Heading straight to university isn’t for everyone. If you aren’t planning on attending college, there are still ways to begin a meaningful career in computer science. 

###  Continue your learning with these partners:
- [Lambda school](https://lambdaschool.com/code-org/?clickid=WwT36g1nlxyJR4n0EkzjZTwgUklzL-X9W1lFWE0&irgwc=1&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=1409860&utm_source=impact) trains people online to be software engineers at no up-front cost. Instead of paying tuition, students can agree to pay a percentage of their income after they're employed, and only if they're making more than $50k per year. If you don't find a job, or don't reach that level of income, you'll never pay a cent.
- [Enroll in a skills-based boot camp](https://www.trilogyed.com/students/?utm_source=mkt-partnership&utm_campaign=trilogyed-students&utm_term=codeorg&utm_content=hsgrads) powered by Trilogy Education. Programs include coding, data, design, and cybersecurity. More than 45 leading institutions, including Harvard Extension, UC Berkeley Extension, Penn LPS, and Georgia Tech, partner with Trilogy. Thousands of individuals have completed Trilogy-powered programs, and over 2,000 companies employ them. If you’re at least 18 years old and have a high school diploma or GED, apply now. Mention **Code.org** to an admissions advisor for a $500 scholarship on select programs. This offer is only valid for new applicants and cannot be combined with other offers.
