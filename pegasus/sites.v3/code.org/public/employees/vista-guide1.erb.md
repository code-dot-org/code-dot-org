# Vista Equity Partners and Portfolio Company Organizer Toolkit

The Hour of Code is a one-hour introduction to computer science designed to demystify “code”, to show that anybody can learn the basics, and to broaden participation in the field of computer science. Since 2013, the Hour of Code has been part of Computer Science Education Week, an annual celebration of the computing field and its heritage. Now a global movement, the Hour of Code has served almost 400 million Hours of Code in 180+ countries! 

Help bring these life changing skills to your children and local students!

### Sample Outreach Messaging

[letter]

Subject Line: Bring computer science to [ORGANIZATION]!

Dear [NAME],

Computer science is foundational knowledge for all students in the 21st century, but most schools don’t teach it--especially at the elementary level. And within the schools that do provide CS classes, boys outnumber girls 4 to 1. [Vista Equity Partners/Portfolio Company] is passionate about providing these **life-changing opportunities to the diverse youth** in our communities and would like to invite you and your students to a special event!

[Vista Equity Partners/Portfolio Company] will be hosting an Hour of Code event at our office with our employees to help **introduce students to the fun and innovative world of tech** alongside our teach professionals. Your students will go through a 1-hour tutorial that not only introduce CS, but also helps to **breakdown stereotypes on who "should" work in tech**. We will provide all the tech devices, volunteers, snacks, certificates, and other goodies - all you need to do is show up with your eager students!

As a proud partner of Code.org, we strongly believe that all students should have the opportunity to learn this skill that is changing our world. Thank you for considering bringing these life-changing skills to our children and we would be thrilled to work with you and your fantastic organization! I look forward to hearing from you.

Best,
<br>SIGNED

## Plan your event
Once you have connected with a local youth organization or school and set a date, it is time to begin planning your event!

### 1) Watch this how-to video
<iframe width="500" height="255" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/SrnvvWDm73k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### 2) Choose a tutorial:
Code.org provides a variety of [fun, hour-long tutorials](https://hourofcode.com/learn) for students of all ages, created by a variety of education partners. 

**[Student-guided Hour of Code tutorials:](https://hourofcode.com/learn)**

- Require minimal prep-time for teachers
- Are self-guided - allowing students to work at their own pace and skill-level

**[Teacher-guided Hour of Code tutorials:](https://code.org/educate/curriculum/teacher-led)**

- Are lesson plans that require some advance teacher preparation
- Are categorized by grade level *and* by subject area (eg Math, English, etc)

[<img src="/images/fit-700/tutorials.png">](<%= resolve_url('/learn') %>)


### 3) Plan your technology needs

The best Hour of Code experience includes Internet-connected computers. But you **don’t** need a computer for every child, and you can even do the Hour of Code without a computer at all. 

**Plan Ahead!** Do the following before your event starts:

- Test tutorials on student computers or devices. Make sure they work properly on browsers with sound and video.
- Provide headphones for your class, or ask students to bring their own, if the tutorial you choose works best with sound.
- **Don't have enough devices?** Use [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q). When students partner up, they help each other and rely less on the teacher. They’ll also see that computer science is social and collaborative.
- **Have low bandwidth?** Plan to show videos at the front of the class, so each student isn't downloading their own videos. Or try the unplugged / offline tutorials.
- **Are there any Hour of Code activities for students with disabilities?**<br>
We’re working to improve our selection but for now we only have a recommendation for Quorum. This [lesson plan](https://drive.google.com/a/code.org/file/d/0B4hvv01Osu00OTdyX0J3RkZJZ1E/view?usp=drivesdk) is for an activity designed for visually challenged students.

### 4) Get your employees to sign up!
After you send out communication to gather employee volunteers, reach out to those who have signed up to let them know all the details. Try this suggested messaging:

[letter]

[/letter]


### 4) Plan travel logistics

Work closely with the local youth organization or school to decide what works best for travel. We strongly suggest letting the guardians or chaperones organize travel.  

### 5) Identify an inspiring speaker
Identify a diverse tech employee or executive leader at your office to inspire students by talking about the breadth of possibilities in computer science. Possible speaking points:

- Share an inspirational story: How did the speaker get involved in a career in tech? Who inspired them? What do they love most about their job?
- Why is tech important?
- Share how computer science has broad, worldwide impact.
- Engage students by asking questions: Do the students use apps? What are their favorite apps? What do they know about computer science/what do they think computer science is?
- Don't forget to leave time for questions!


### Sample Agenda
|Time | Agenda item|
|-----------------| ------------|
|10-15 minutes | Introduction and speaker: </ul><li>What do you do at Vista Equity Partners/Portfolio Company, and what do you love most about your job, how has tech influenced you?</li><li>What or who inspired you</li><li>Did you have a mentor?</li><li>Share a story about how tech affects everyone</ul>|
