Every student should have the opportunity to learn computer science. Computational thinking helps nurture problem-solving skills, logic, and creativity. And technology is transforming every industry on the planet. Students today should learn how to create technology, not just use it. By starting early, they’ll have a foundation for success in any 21st-century career path.

*Thank you for joining Code.org to help introduce millions of students to computer science through the Hour of Code!*

## Overview

Anyone passionate about computer science education and careers in tech can be a volunteer. We want volunteers of all ages, backgrounds and experience levels who have a passion for increasing diversity in tech. The Hour of Code has a large variety of tutorials for all ages and skill levels so you don’t need to be an expert to volunteer!

As a Hour of Code event volunteer, you will guide students as they try computer science for the first time!

Once you have signed up to be a volunteer, your office organizer will reach out when volunteer opportunities become available.

<a name="why"></a>
### **Why volunteer?**
Check out some testimony from past volunteers:

- *“The best part of my experience was that the entire class were women and people of color. It bodes well for the future of our industry to have a chance to reach and excite these kids.”*
- *“Especially enjoyed getting to encourage young girls in technology. Felt like I was helping the next generation in my local area.”*
- *“I LOVED seeing how excited the kids were. One amazing thing was that the teachers noticed that some of the students who didn’t do as well academically were excelling at thinking like a developer and helping others are them - giving them a place to feel confident.”*

## Volunteer at an Hour of Code event

<a name="prepare"></a>
### **How to prepare:**

* If you're going to be doing a tutorial during your session, spend 30 minutes trying at least one [Hour of Code tutorial](/learn). Reach out to your event organizer to see if they have selected a specific tutorial.
* Review these [teaching tips](https://code.org/files/CSTT_Volunteers.pdf) about how to interact with students


**Have you been selected as a speaker by your event organizer?** 
</br>
Prepare an intro:
Get the students excited! Work with your event organizer to go over your speaking points and pick out a <a href="#videos">video</a> to help focus the class and get them excited to do an Hour of Code.

Suggested speaking points:

* Introduce yourself: Who you are and what you do?
* Share an inspirational story: How you got interested in computer science. What or who inspired you? What do you love most about your job?
* Share how computer science has broad, worldwide impact.
* Engage students by asking questions: Do the students use apps? What are their favorite apps? What do they know about computer science/what do they think computer science is?
* Don't forget to save some time for questions!

<a name="practices"></a>
### **Day-of best practices:**

* Let the students dive into the tutorials. Walk around to help answer questions and guide students through tough puzzles. Try not to give students the solution outright, instead try asking them questions so they can answer themselves what went wrong.
* Encourage students to ask each other if they have questions. Learning from each other is a great learning opportunity. Often kids can solve the problems themselves and through teamwork. 
* At the completion of the activities, hand out your Vista Equity Partners or Portfolio Company swag (stickers are awesome) and answer any remaining questions!
* Also important to mention that if you do take pictures/videos during the event -- especially with students -- that your event organizer has **teacher/parent permission** if you would like to post your stories on social media.
