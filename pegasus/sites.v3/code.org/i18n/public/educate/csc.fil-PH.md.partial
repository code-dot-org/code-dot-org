# Mga koneksiyon sa Computer Science

Ginagawa ng pinakabagong kurikulum namin ang mga koneksiyon sa pagitan ng pag-aaral ng computer science at iba pang mga paksa tulad ng matematika, sining ng wika, agham, at pag-aaral sa lipunan. Sa pamamagitan ng Mga koneksiyon sa CS, tinutuklas ng mga K-12 ang kanilang karaniwang paksa sa kapana-panabik na mga bagong paraan!

## Modules

CS Connections modules are a structured series of lessons that integrate computer science learning into core subject areas like math, ELA, and science. These modules are aligned to standards across subjects and culminate in a cross-curricular project.

They're perfect for teachers who'd like to incorporate computer science into their lesson plans for other subjects, as well as CS educators who want to reinforce what students are learning in other subjects.

## Open-ended projects

Continue making connections between computer science and traditional subjects with our cross-curricular projects. They take just 1-2 instructional hours to complete and are ideal for any teachers looking to develop topic-specific projects to fit within their existing curriculum.

<em>Tip: Nangangailangan ang mga proyektong ito ng ilang pag-unawa sa mga pangunahing kaalaman sa computer science, kaya inirerekomenda namin na kumpletuhin ang aming aktibidad sa Hello World Hour of Code bago magsimula!</em>

## Bridging Lessons

Our bridging lessons provide a quick and interesting way to make a connection between computer science and other subjects. These lessons don't require any prior knowledge of computer science, so they're perfect for any teacher who wants to incorporate essential 21st century learning into traditional curriculum or motivate students with new exciting ways to learn older subjects.
