# 電腦科學聯繫

我們的最新課程將學習電腦科學與數學、語言藝術、科學和社會研究等其他學科聯繫起來。 通過電腦科學聯繫，K-12課堂以令人興奮的新方式探索他們的常規科目！

## Modules

CS Connections modules are a structured series of lessons that integrate computer science learning into core subject areas like math, ELA, and science. These modules are aligned to standards across subjects and culminate in a cross-curricular project.

They're perfect for teachers who'd like to incorporate computer science into their lesson plans for other subjects, as well as CS educators who want to reinforce what students are learning in other subjects.

## Open-ended projects

Continue making connections between computer science and traditional subjects with our cross-curricular projects. They take just 1-2 instructional hours to complete and are ideal for any teachers looking to develop topic-specific projects to fit within their existing curriculum.

<em>提示：這些項目需要對電腦科學基礎知識有所瞭解，所以我們建議在開始之前完成你好世界一小時玩程式活動！</em>

## Bridging Lessons

Our bridging lessons provide a quick and interesting way to make a connection between computer science and other subjects. These lessons don't require any prior knowledge of computer science, so they're perfect for any teacher who wants to incorporate essential 21st century learning into traditional curriculum or motivate students with new exciting ways to learn older subjects.
