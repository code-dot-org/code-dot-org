## 概述

随着计算机科学基础课程的出现，计算机教育的方式被极大的改变。 最初，课程 1-4 被设计为一个起点，帮助向往计算机科学的各个年龄段的学生，获取基本知识。 现在，更多的地区、城市和各州开设了从幼儿园开始的计算机科学课程。教师们寻求更多内容，帮助学生共度难关，直到初中/高中毕业。

计算机科学基础课程 A-F 是我们对这个问题的答案。 通过把课程按年级编辑安排，使得我们可以退后一步，重新思考我们呈现课程内容的方式。 还有给予了我们一次全心全意地接受来自支持我们这一使命的敬业教师社区的反馈。 在全国最好的小学 CS 教育专家的帮助下设计，学生们应能够熟悉 A-F 课程，无需额外的专业发展，但课程特色能够在过去完成我们课程的学生之中呈现。

* 课程 A: 幼儿园
* 课程 B: 一年级
* 课程 C: 二年级
* 课程 D: 三年级
* 课程 E: 四年级
* 课程 F: 五年级
* 学龄前速成课程: 幼儿园 至 一年级
* 速成班: 二年级 至 五年级

对 CS 基础的最大更新将从四门课程（课程 1-4）转到与每个 K-5 年级（课程 A-F）对齐的六门课程。 这样一来，这些课程就更加适合达到阅读、数学和整体认知发展的水平。 请注意，增加了两个不同的“速成”课程，一个适用于学龄前儿童，另一个适用于其他所有年级。 这些类似于上一个套件的“速成”版。

## 教授新课程

如上所述，教师应该对这些课程有似曾相识的感觉，但又有些不同之处。 如果您去过 Code.org 专业发展研讨会，那么您就可以教授新课程了。 虽有少许变化，但整体平台、课程和教学理念不变。 如果您尚未参加，Code.org 提供为期 1 天的研讨会，帮助您了解如何理解课程、浏览 Code.org 平台以及教授线下课程。

课程的主要更新有:

* 为年轻学习者准备的圆桌事件故事
* 架构与练习，或应用概念的新方法
* 过渡活动，加强从线下课程过渡到线上课程
* 年龄较大的学生课程结束项目

本指南的其余部分将更详细地介绍每个想法，并在您的课堂中提供实现更改的提示和技巧。

## 圆桌事件故事（A与B课程）

有些概念仅仅通过活动和测试题教授是相当困难的，尤其是对低龄学生而言。 这就是为什么我们在幼儿园和一年级的课程中引入了少量的圆桌事件故事。 教师在班上朗读这些故事，并在中途停下来和学生一起进行诸如除错、坚持和挫败等关键想法的讨论。 我们希望通过故事人物接触复杂概念的方法可以帮助学生们在未来课程中更好地认识同样的概念。

以下为如何使用圆桌事件故事的情景：

### 在课堂阅读适当的故事：

* 请务必在行动过程中的有效时刻，通过询问和评语检验学生是否理解。
* 之后讨论故事。 您的学生学到了什么？ 他们有什么想法吗？
* 试着让学生认同角色。 他们在生活中做了什么会让他们想起故事中的一个角色？

### 在学生开始下阶段活动前重提这个故事

* 你还记得我们讨论过的主要想法吗？
* 如果你今天看到这个想法，你怎么知道呢？
* 这个角色是怎么处理这个想法的？ 你会做什么？

### 指出故事与学生的情况在活动中发生交集时的相似之处。

* 为学生描述他们所处的位置与书中描述的情况有何相似之处。 
* 让学生思考这些角色，并找出他们可能会做什么。 能够帮助学生找到下一步该怎么做吗？

如果您无法将整个分类结合在一起，Code.org 在适当的课程之开始时提供了一个视频选项，以有限的动画展示故事。 虽然这些视频不能提供完全相同的体验，但是这些视频会让学生在继续学习其余课程之前先接触到概念和角色。

## 课程架构与挑战谜题（所有年龄段）

Courses A-F are less scaffolded overall than our previous courses. That means that we try to have students create their code from the beginning as often as possible, unless they are specifically learning to debug. As part of this design, most of our online lessons follow a trend where we present a simple puzzle to begin the lesson, then slowly drill forward with a new concept until the point where students have had a chance to understand the idea underneath. Next, we present them with a challenge puzzle, which is intended to get students thinking about the concept in a new and complicated way.

Challenge puzzles are new in Courses A-F. The intention of challenge puzzles is to expose students to a high bar where they can practice persistence and independent thought. Challenge puzzles are intentionally hard and designed so that only students who truly understand the concept will pass within a reasonable timeframe. This means that a good number of students will not be successful on challenges their first time through. This requires a particular attitude from both student and teacher to pull off.

1. Students should give these challenges a hearty try, then put them aside and carry on. That practice allows for two very important things to happen:
2. Students gain a better understanding of when and why to use the concept being studied. The following puzzles feel easier after the challenge, even though they are serious puzzles in their own right.

Keep in mind that students can go through lessons and reattempt incomplete puzzles at any time. Sometimes it can be quite helpful to get a good night’s sleep before revisiting a tough problem.

Once students make it past the challenge, they will find a handful of exercises waiting for them that are similar to what they may have experienced in the first half of the stage. These puzzles were placed intentionally to test a student’s clarity on the subject being studied. They might seem far too easy, given the puzzles that were experienced beforehand, but they were created to demonstrate the exact level of competence desired from the corresponding stage.

In some instances, we end our lessons with free-play style levels. These levels might either have no “wrong” answer, or they might allow several different ways to solve their core problem. Please encourage students to give them their best shot and not just click “Continue” even though they can.

这方面的一些最后说明:

* Remind students to be persistent and use their debugging skills on problems that feel tough.
* Videos are often helpful. When students get stuck, have them rewatch the video a second, third, or even fourth time.
* Require students to read the instructions. If they are having a hard time, let them read the instructions out loud to a classmate.
* 想用提示？不要紧！ Students should use as many hints as they need, but be sure to attempt re-solving the puzzle at least one between each new offering.

## 不需要计算机的过渡活动（所有年龄段）

Unplugged activities meet students where they are in terms of pointing out how they already use important CS concepts in their everyday life. Once students can identify fundamental ideas like loops and conditionals, they get over the mental blocks that can happen when trying to use them for the first time programming online.

Unplugged experiences are so important that we chose to take them one step further and bake in activities that bridge the unplugged lessons to their online counterparts. In Courses A-F, you will now find that lesson plans provide examples of how to take the offline exercises and translate the lessons to the following set of online puzzles. Appropriately, we call these "Bridging Activities."

For the most part, bridging activities can be created either by taking the subject of the unplugged exercise and executing it with paper Blockly blocks, or by taking an online puzzle and solving it using the language from the unplugged exercise. In some cases, a different relationship is introduced, but all of the examples are meant to keep the offline experiences from feeling too abstract or unrelated.

## 课程结束 (课程 E & F)

For older students, we have introduced substantial end of course projects in Courses E & F. Though Code.org has provided the ability to build “projects” for quite a while, we felt that it would add some much needed perspective for students to be able to plan and execute their projects in a formal context.

The end of course projects are relatively straightforward. Over the period of four to five weeks students will review project ideas, plan their application, code their program, revise based on feedback (5th grade), then present their completed work. Each of these steps is guided by a helpful handout, as well as a teacher lesson plan that highlights the big picture.

**Review:** Students will take a look at a handful of aspirational projects, built to showcase the amazing things that can be done with the skills that they have learned up to this point. These projects have been built either in Play Lab or Artist, but students are free to review projects from Tynker, Scratch, or even text-based languages if the teacher sees fit.

**Plan:** The intention here is for students to sit back and think about what is really possible. They will need to think about the games that they saw, and the limitations that they faced when editing them. Afterward, they will sketch out a plan to create something unique. Students might need to be reminded to stay realistic, as they will have limited time and resources when bringing their visions to life. The materials here assume the use of Artist or Play Lab, but projects can be moved to whatever platform works for each particular classroom.

**Build:** One day is not a whole lot of time to execute a plan that has been laid out on paper. Students will face tough choices when it comes to trying to make things work as they run into one barrier after another. They will learn to edit and adapt as bugs and program limitations change their perceptions of what can comfortably be accomplished in a restricted timeframe.

**Revise:** For older students, a day of revising their programs based on the feedback of classmates can help them improve their final product, and lets them inspire others with the things that they have achieved. Students will practice constructive critique, as well as group brainstorming and persistence.

**Present:** Nearly a month in the making, this is the chance for students to stand-up and be proud of how far they have come. Our lesson plan assumes an oral presentation, but teachers have the option of suggesting written or multimedia presentations instead.

No matter how thoroughly students embed themselves in their projects, they are sure to learn something useful about the processes of creativity and problem solving in computer science.

None of these things are required when puzzles are too easy to complete. For this reason, we’ve had to make puzzles more difficult. Please refer to the teacher guide for help with leading your class in building these skills. As always, don’t underestimate the importance of using unplugged lessons before jumping in with the online puzzles.      |
| **有些测试题只允许使用指定数目的单元块。 What if my students want to code something out the long way before they figure out loops?** | There are a few puzzles that restrict specific blocks. This is one of our new manners of scaffolding. It is a way of giving direction, without over scaffolding the pieces in the workspace itself. For students who like to code puzzles the long way before they pare down (and, in fact for all students, all the time) it is useful to have a journal or scratch paper beside the keyboard where they can figure out the algorithm in whatever way comes most naturally. |
