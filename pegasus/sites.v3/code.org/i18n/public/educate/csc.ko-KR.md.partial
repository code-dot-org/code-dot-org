# 컴퓨터 과학 커넥션

이 최신 커리큘럼은 컴퓨터 과학 학습을 수학 및 언어, 과학, 사회와 같은 다른 과목의 학습에 연결합니다. CS 커넥션을 통해, K-12 학급은 흥미롭고 새로운 방식으로 일반 과목을 탐구합니다!

## 모듈

CS Connections modules are a structured series of lessons that integrate computer science learning into core subject areas like math, ELA, and science. These modules are aligned to standards across subjects and culminate in a cross-curricular project.

They're perfect for teachers who'd like to incorporate computer science into their lesson plans for other subjects, as well as CS educators who want to reinforce what students are learning in other subjects.

## 오픈 엔드 프로젝트

Continue making connections between computer science and traditional subjects with our cross-curricular projects. They take just 1-2 instructional hours to complete and are ideal for any teachers looking to develop topic-specific projects to fit within their existing curriculum.

<em>팁: 이 프로젝트들은 어느 정도 컴퓨터 과학의 기초적 이해가 필요합니다. 헬로 월드 아워 오브 코드 활동을 완료한 다음에 시작하기를 권장합니다!</em>
