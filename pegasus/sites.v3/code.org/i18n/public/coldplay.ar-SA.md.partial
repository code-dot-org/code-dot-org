# انضم إلى حفلة رقص كولد بلاي Coldplay

Coldplay and Code.org believe in the power of computer science education for every student, in every classroom around the world. That's why we're teaming up to inspire students everywhere to code and dance - let's celebrate the magic of computer science and music!

Join the party by using Code.org's Dance Party activity to code your own choreography to Coldplay's "Higher Power." Get creative with classic moves, and have fun with new album-inspired visuals and dancer formations!

Post your creations for Coldplay and Code.org to see, and we'll share the best ones on social media. Plus, if you participate by June 10, 2022, you'll get a chance to win tickets to see Coldplay on tour, or a chance for your classroom to video chat with the band.

We can't wait to see and share what you create!

## شارك إبداعاتك مع Code.org و Coldplay لنراها!

We'd love to see what classrooms and students create - whether it's dance moves in code, or a video of yourself dancing along. Coldplay and Code.org will re-share or comment on the most creative stuff we see.

**This promotion has now ended, and the winners have been notified. Congratulations to all winners.**

## Make the coolest dance and win concert tickets, or even chat with Coldplay!

In every city on the [tour](https://www.coldplay.com/tour/) we will pick two students and two chaperones to receive free tickets to the concert - we will pick from projects posted or submitted by individual/single students. We will also select *one* classroom globally to have a video call with the band, and we will pick among the projects that feature entire classrooms dancing.

## كيف سيختار Code.org من يمكنه مشاهدة Coldplay؟

We'll be looking first and foremost for creativity and fun - code a "Higher Power" dance that really wows, and ideally pair it up with some actual dancing. For example, check out this \[unfinished choreography made by a former Code.org engineer\] (https://studio.code.org/projects/dance/S_vcQiglulAGJ0tkN4cv2g) - feel free to remix, change, and complete it. For extra fun, record a video of yourself and/or friends dancing to your creation!
