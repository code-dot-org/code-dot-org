**Bu promosyon şimdi sona erdi ve kazananlara bilgi verildi. Congratulations to all winners.**

## En havalı dansı yapın ve konser biletleri kazanın, hatta Coldplay ile sohbet edin!

In every city on the [tour](https://www.coldplay.com/tour/) we will pick two students and two chaperones to receive free tickets to the concert - we will pick from projects posted or submitted by individual/single students. We will also select *one* classroom globally to have a video call with the band, and we will pick among the projects that feature entire classrooms dancing.

## Code.org, Coldplay'i kimin izleyeceğini nasıl seçecek?

We'll be looking first and foremost for creativity and fun - code a "Higher Power" dance that really wows, and ideally pair it up with some actual dancing. For example, check out this \[unfinished choreography made by a former Code.org engineer\] (https://studio.code.org/projects/dance/S_vcQiglulAGJ0tkN4cv2g) - feel free to remix, change, and complete it. For extra fun, record a video of yourself and/or friends dancing to your creation!
