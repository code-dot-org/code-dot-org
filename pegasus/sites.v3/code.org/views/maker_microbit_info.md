Have you completed CS Fundamentals Course C, D, E or F with your students and are looking to continue your learning? We have partnered with micro:bit to offer 4 extension lessons for each course. These lessons extend the learning students have done during CS Fundamentals while allowing students to try their hand at being a maker and learn about physical computing.
