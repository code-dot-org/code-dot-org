CS Discoveries is an introductory course for 6-10th grade students that can be flexibly taught as a single semester, two semesters over multiple years, or as a full year course. Mapped to CSTA standards, the course takes a wide lens on computer science by covering topics such as problem solving, programming, physical computing, user-centered design, and data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, while inspiring students as they build their own websites, apps, games, and physical computing devices.
