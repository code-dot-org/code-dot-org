**What teachers are saying…**

“This was a wonderful, fun, and informative workshop. Our facilitator was helpful, patient, and knowledgeable. I would (and have) highly recommended this training to my colleagues. It was an excellent introduction to computer science for someone who has never studied the coding side of technology before. Thank you so much for this wonderful experience, I can hardly wait to try the lessons with my kids!”

“It was a fantastic course... I was scared of the idea of coding before as I thought it was something I would never understand. I was intimidated to say the least. Bobbi’s kindness, patience and expertise, in combination with your outstanding materials has changed my perspective completely! What a great use of my time!”
