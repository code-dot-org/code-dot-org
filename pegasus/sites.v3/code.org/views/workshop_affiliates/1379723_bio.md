Heather has been an active member in the Connecticut chapter of the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) for many years,and is also on Connecticut’s Computer Science Advisory Board. Currently in a position as a technology teacher at the CREC Montessori Magnet School in Hartford, she continues to be extremely passionate about providing computer science education to all students. Working with elementary age students she is able to see first-hand how powerful it is when students are given the opportunity to learn programming concepts and establish critical thinking skills at an early age.
