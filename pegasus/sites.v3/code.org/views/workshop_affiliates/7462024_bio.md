Flint is passionate about teaching Computer Science because it is the language of privilege in the 21st century.  He believes this will open doors for the traditionally underrepresented students he teaches at Skyline High School in Oakland, CA.  He is Vice President of the Golden Gate Chapter of the Computer Science Teachers Association and co-directs the Computer Science Academy at Skyline.  In addition to his high school Computer Science teaching duties, he is instructor of a course for teachers seeking their Computer Science teaching credential through Alameda County and UC Berkeley Extension.
