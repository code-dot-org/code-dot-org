Ann is a software developer with a passion for all things education and especially loves kid's creativity and imagination.  She has always believed every child has a unique spark whether it be music, sports or computer science.   This point was driven home after watching her own children learn and grow.  She has over 20 years experience in the IT Industry in a wide variety of areas and especially enjoyed software development and teaching.  She has a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Ohio University and  a Masters in Administration from Central Michigan University.  She currently operates Code Rangers which hosts several coding camps in Ohio and South Carolina, creates software development projects for kids of all ages and works with community businesses on the importance of computer science for sustainability.
