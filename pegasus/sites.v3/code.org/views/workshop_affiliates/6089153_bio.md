Kim became a teacher 28 years ago. Her favorite thing about it has always been seeing the “bulb” light up when kids figure something out or see what they're capable of! She soon discovered a love of using technology with her students. She saw it as a tool that helped expand and equalize learning opportunities for all students. 

She spent 15 years teaching K12 students/teachers full-time how to maximize the effect of technology use. She taught core subjects, STEM, Tech Applications, A/V Production, and Digital Citizenship courses, and was the site technology coordinator for 11 of those years. She is currently an Apple Foundations trainer, Google educator and certified NetSafe trainer.
