**What teachers say about Katie's workshops**

"Katie, our facilitator was excellent! She was very well prepared, very knowledgeable about the material, and had a great attitude with high energy for the entire workshop. The material that you have organized is extremely user-friendly and I feel extremely prepared to begin the program in the fall at my school. I know that if I have any questions or ideas or concerns that I will be well supported from code.org. Thank you for an excellent professional development! It was well worth the time!"

"Katie was a wonderful trainer. She had energy, flexibility and a great memory! She made connections between the people in the training and the situations she had or the material that she was covering. Positive experience all the way around."

"It was great to hear from an educator using the Code.org curriculum. She provided practical tips since she was using it with a range of students."

The facilitator was incredible! The entire experience was extremely positive and I left feeling so much more confident about digging in to teach computer science to my kindergartners! I'm hoping to share the excitement of CODE with colleagues and send my thanks and appreciation for a great experience! :)"
