**What teachers are saying…**

“I have attended many various kinds of professional development, and yesterday’s was truly thrilling, informational, and motivating. Your passion for spreading computer science learning is shared, and admired.”

“It was one of the best workshops that I have attended. Our students participated in the Hour of Code in December, but this training will take coding to a new level. Love the follow links and info. I’ll pass it on.”

“I really enjoyed the workshop yesterday and I am so excited to introduce the Code.org program to our students. Thanks so much for the wonderful instruction!”
