My "official" title is Professional Learning Content Specialist which simply means I create and deliver professional learning workshops. I am part of the Teaching and Learning team for the Oklahoma Public School Resource Center so I get to work with teachers throughout the state.  I have been a CSF facilitator for a few years now and am excited to see interest increasing in Oklahoma.
