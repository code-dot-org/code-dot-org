Melissa teaches Computer Science at Hackley, a K-12 private school in Tarrytown, New York. She grew up in Westchester County and majored in the field as an undergraduate. Melissa decided to get her masters in Educational Technology to provide her with opportunities to teach a subject she is passionate about. She has been teaching for nearly 10 years with experience in both the public and private sector. Melissa has facilitated professional development for her colleagues and understands how valuable an educator’s time is. She believes that providing early exposure to the subject is essential. Melissa wants educator’s to gain confidence so that they develop the enthusiasm and drive to persist. “It’s important for our students to take a chance and try a computer science course to see if it sparks excitement. I’m a big believer of trying to answer as many ’what if’ questions in your life as possible.”
