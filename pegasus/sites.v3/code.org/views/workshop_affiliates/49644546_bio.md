## Carla Neely[carla.neely@clevelandmetroschools.org](mailto: carla.neely@clevelandmetroschools.org)I have been a teacher for urban/inner city students for 22 years. I am certified to teach 1st – 8th grade. I have a masters degree in curriculum and technology. In the spring of 2021, I became a certified master teacher for the state of Ohio. I am currently the 5th and 6th grade science teacher for the Cleveland Metropolitan School District at Warner Girls Leadership Academy in Cleveland, Ohio. Even though I am labeled as a science teacher, I teach my students using the STEM framework. I began teaching computer science four years ago using CS Fundamentals with my fourth and fifth grade students. I later became trained in CS Discoveries and decided to use it as my 6th grade students’ CS Program. I have a passion for bringing a variety of CS opportunities to African American girls beginning at the elementary and middle school level. Even though I have experience teaching all subjects, my true love and expertise is with science.
