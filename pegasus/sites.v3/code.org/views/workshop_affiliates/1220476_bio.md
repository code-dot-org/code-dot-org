**What teachers are saying…**

“Seriously, this was the best PD I’ve been too! I never felt tired, time flew by, we were allowed to appropriately interact and share ideas. Absolutely, loved my time - I’m still feeling incredibly happy to have attended this all day Saturday!”

“I have never attended a workshop where everyone was so excited about the content! The enthusiasm projected from our instructor was infectious, and we were all so excited to share this with our students. Also very much appreciated the time given to figure out everything we could do with Code.org with our students during our time there.”
