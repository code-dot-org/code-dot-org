Leslie is a statewide computer science specialist in Arkansas.  She enjoys learning and teaching computer science concepts because the power of problem-solving and technology can be a fantastic duo!  Leslie has a background in science and technology and has been in education for over 15 years.  Leslie loves to use and share Code.org resources for two different reasons.  First, it is comprehensive in teaching core concepts in a user-friendly fashion.  Second, it makes learning fun and interactive, by using both unplugged and plugged activities, resources, and projects!
