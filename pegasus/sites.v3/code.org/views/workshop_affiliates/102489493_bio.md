In his current role in the Information Technology department, he supports the entire district by promoting the safe and effective use of all district provided technologies.  He is a National Board-Certified teacher, a Microsoft Innovative Educator Expert, MIE Certified Trainer, MIE Global Training Partner, and a Minecraft Global Mentor.

Bradley spends what is left of his personal time learning more about the effective use of instructional technology in the classroom.  Whatever “free time” he has is spent with his family and on the restoration of antique & classic car restorations.
