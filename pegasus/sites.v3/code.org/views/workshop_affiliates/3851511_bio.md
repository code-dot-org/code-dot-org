​I have 24 years of teaching experience in and out of the classroom at the K-5 level. 16 of those years I provided library, reading and technology classes and have held a few leadership positions: reading coach, technology coach & writing coordinator.  For 10 years, after the academic day, I spent my time as a middle school volleyball coach.  In the Summer of 2016, I taught several technology classes for Central Washington University Stem Cats program (grades 1-8): Making Your 1st Video Game, Creating 3D Video Games, Video Game Animation & Minecraft Modding.  Currently, I am a 21st Century Specialist.  I teach technology skills, safety and computer science.  Outside of school, I am an avid yoga practitioner and certified yoga instructor.  I teach at the Yoga Hotspot in Yakima, Washington.
