Leka is a first grade teacher at Spirit Lake Elementary in Iowa. She is enthusiastic about providing her students with opportunities to enhance their 21st century skills. She has intergraded coding and programming into her classroom and believes that experiences with computer science truly inspire young learners to be better communicators, collaborators and problem solvers.
