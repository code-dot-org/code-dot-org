Vinny Chiaramonte has a passion for lifelong learning, education, computer science (CS), technology, problem solving, and all things social science. He started teaching CS in 2014 at Bumpus Middle School in Hoover AL. He is an advocate for access and opportunities for every student in every school. While Vinny does not believe every student should be a computer scientist, he does believe all students should become solution makers and creators, beyond just solving problems they encounter in life. He believes a person's view of the world changes when they see how things work, the logic involved, and the understanding that it’s not magic. When students realize they can create something they never thought imaginable for themselves, they become empowered. The sky's the limit no matter the field they want to work in. CS may be the best vehicle to get them there. Vinny uses a variety of tools and resources to teach CS. One such tool is code.org’s Code Studio. He enjoy’s consistently growing and thrives on pouring into and developing those around him.
