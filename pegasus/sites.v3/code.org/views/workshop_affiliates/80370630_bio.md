I am a life-longer learner who has worked in education in different roles across the U.S. and the world. I taught C.S. in the classroom and my passion for tech remains, especially coding and learning about trends in tech. When I was in the classroom last, I learned with my students: Java, front-end web development, block-based coding and Python. Coding was fun and frustrating and I know that many of my former students will go on to study STEM and that made it the most rewarding experience. I have a B.S. in Public Policy from the University of Southern California and an M.A. in International Affairs from the New School. In my current work, I am in the Curriculum and Instruction team at NAF and I am excited to be in a position of creating resources and opportunities for thousands of students. On a personal note, I am a pet mom to my rescue dog Danger. I live in Miami but I grew up in Los Angeles and I would like to make it back to California in the future because I canâ€™t take the humidity and want to be close to my nieces.
