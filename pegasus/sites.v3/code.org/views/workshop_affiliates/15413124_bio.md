## Sally Schmitt[tanguay32@gmail.com](mailto: tanguay32@gmail.com)I teach Computer Science Discoveries at Hunters Creek Middle School in Jacksonville, NC. This will be only the second year that Computer Science is offered to middle school students in Onslow County, and I am one of only two teachers in the county teaching Computer Science at the middle school level.  I hope to see Computer Science expanded to all the middle schools in the county within the next two years. I hold a BA in Computer Science but taught science, math and technology until recently. I also just completed my MAEd in Instructional Technology.  I hope to start a coding club at my school this year and have a long term goal of beginning a ‘Girls in STEM’ program in the county. In my spare time I enjoy reading, but also like to learn different coding languages and experiment with technological gadgets that can be used to supplement my classroom lessons.
