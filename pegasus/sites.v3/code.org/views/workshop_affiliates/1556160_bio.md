**What teachers are saying…**

“I have been teaching for over 30 years and by and far this is one of the best, if not the best workshops I have ever attended. It was a beautiful Saturday when I attended this workshop and I did not regret giving up a perfect day to attend.”

“This workshop was so enlightening and a fantastic learning experience for those of us like me who did not have any idea about coding. I am very excited about sharing what I learned to my colleagues and especially to my students. I never knew that coding could be so much fun. I look forward to getting more involved in coding. The facilitator was on key and very knowledgeable about coding.”
