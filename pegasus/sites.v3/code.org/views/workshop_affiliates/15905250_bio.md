## Sherry Gillooly[gilloolys@comcast.net](mailto: gilloolys@comcast.net)I have thoroughly enjoyed being a Facilitator for CSD for the past three years. I am passionate about CS and education in general. My primary job is as a Computer Applications Teacher at Great Valley Middle School. I switched districts during the pandemic, so I taught six grade levels during the 2020-21 school year. It was an adventure! I enjoy teaching both middle and high school students. Before I became a teacher, I was successful in the business world for 15 years. 

My hobbies are: traveling, reading, hiking, skating and mostly anything outdoors. I look forward to meeting everyone.
