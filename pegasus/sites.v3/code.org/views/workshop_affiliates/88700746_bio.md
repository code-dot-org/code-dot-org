For almost two decades Kal has worked and supported students, educators, and administrators as a teacher, STEM Specialist, Technology Director, Educator Mentor and Coach, and researcher. He left K12 education in 2016 to direct a research project that focused on rural communities and how best to integrate STEM Learning outside of the classroom. In 2020 he and colleagues submitted a proposal to the National Science Foundation to develop a pathway that supports rural K8 district educators in the integration of computer science across the curriculum. This project was funded and brought him back to working with administrators and educators. In addition to CS Fundamentals, Kal is a trained SCRIPT Facilitator, a PEAR (STEM program) Evaluator, and huge astronomy enthusiast.
