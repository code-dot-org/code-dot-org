**What teachers say about Stephen's workshops**

"Steve was a kind and extremely helpful instructor. I had absolutely no knowledge of computer science and coding, but his patience and positive attitude made me more receptive and even excited to get coding into my classroom immediately. Thank you very much for all your help, Steve!"

"I felt this was an outstanding workshop that inspired me to bring more computer science into my students. One of the best things I took away from the workshop was that I walked away feeling I can get started right away. Steve is a great presenter that made a difficult subject approachable and enjoyable."

"It was very engaging and collaborative for us as educators, without any doubt, implementing what was learned with our students will be fun, engaging and boost their interest in computer science."
