Steve is a Mathematics and Computer Science Teacher at Adlai E. Stevenson High School in Lincolnshire, IL.  After completing his undergraduate degree at UIC in Secondary Math Education, he was unexpectedly bitten by the CS bug three years into his teaching career, completed a Master's Degree in CS from DePaul in '08, and, never looking back, proceeded to share his love of computing to hundreds of students over a 12-year span.  His hope as a facilitator is to help empower both novice and veteran computer science teachers around Chicagoland and beyond to deliver to students an ultimately enjoyable, challenging, memorable, and rewarding computer science experience in their own classes.
