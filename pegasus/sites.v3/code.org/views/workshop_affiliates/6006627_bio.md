**What teachers say about Paige's workshops**

"I came out of the workshop fired up and ready to promote computer science curriculum at my school. The presentation, materials and resources provided to us were outstanding."

"Paige was incredibly helpful in becoming acquainted with the code.org materials and the hour of code. I feel inspired, well-prepared, and knowledgeable. The workshop was well-done, engaging, helpful, education, and motivational. I am very excited to start teaching code in my classroom and in afterschool clubs."
