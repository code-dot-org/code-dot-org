## Matthew Feiler[matthew.feiler@browardschools.com](mailto: matthew.feiler@browardschools.com)For as long as I can remember, I have enjoyed working with both children and computers. After graduating college with a degree in Information Technology and Computer Science, I chose to follow my passion for working with children and entered the field of education.  During my first ten years in the classroom, I had the opportunity to teach almost every subject but after a decade I found myself burnt out. Luckily, in my eleventh year I was given the opportunity to teach Computer Science and since then my passion for teaching has grown each year as Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to expose more and more students to the subject I love most. 

Currently, I am the Computer Science teacher at West Broward High School in Pembroke Pines, FL and have been using Code.org in my classroom since its inception. Over the past decade, I have taught Middle School CS in Science, Exploring Computer Science, Computer Science Discoveries, and Computer Science Principles. In addition to teaching my students, I have spent the past two years helping Florida teachers earn their certification in Computer Science by facilitating workshops for the state department of education and several school districts.
