Olivier has been teaching at the International School of the Peninsula since 1999, and has served as Curriculum coordinator since 2006. Teaching coding to students in Elementary school has become a passion since his school first participated in the hour of code. Since then, he was given the task of implementing a comprehensive coding curriculum, and acts as computer science specialist from 1st through 5th grade. 
He has been using code.org resources, and particularly appreciates the balance between unplugged and on-screen activities. He believes coding classes are fundamentally engaging for students, and an amazing way to integrate other subjects such as math, science or langage arts.
