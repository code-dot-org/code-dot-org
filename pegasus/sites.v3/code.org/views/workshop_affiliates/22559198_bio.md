## Jeff Reinhardt[jreinhardt@uaschools.org](mailto: jreinhardt@uaschools.org)Jeff has been teaching mathematics and computer science in high school for over 20 years. He is a graduate of Northwestern University and The Ohio State University with degrees in history and mathematics education. Since 2018, Jeff has enjoyed being a Code.org Facilitator for CS Principles. He loves collaborating with students and colleagues to discover, solve, connect, and create. Curiously, he seems to enjoy a lot of things that begin with “c”: chocolate, coffee, cycling, cello, calculus, and of course, computer science!
