Tyler Watts, M.A., Ed. S., is a Computer Science educator that teaches child and adult learners to become digital creators, not just consumers. Everyone will not work as a Computer Scientist in their future, but they will need to be able to critically think and be creative, which coding strengthens. Our world is becoming increasingly powered by code, so it is beneficial to have an understanding of how a computer thinks. Visual coding languages, like Code.orgâ€™s Blockly, do for programming, what the printing press did for reading. A skill that was once only acquired by a small, elite group can now be mastered by anyone with a desire to learn.
