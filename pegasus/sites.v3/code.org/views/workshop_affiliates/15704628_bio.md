Matt has been a proud member in the field of education since the '03 - '04 school year, initially as a Math teacher in the Parkway School District. In 2011, he embraced a new opportunity when asked by a colleague to teach computer science. At that time, the only CS offering was the CSA, with a class size of around 15 students.

Driven by a passion for expanding educational horizons, Matt successfully developed the computer science program within the district. Through his efforts, the program has grown to offer four CS courses, attracting more than 180 students each year.

In addition to his teaching role, Matt serves on the school board for the district where he lives, actively contributing to educational policies and decision-making. He also lends his expertise to various CS advisory committees, where his insights shape the future of computer science education. As a proud member of the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA), Matt engages with a community of like-minded educators dedicated to promoting excellence in CS education.

Matt has been a facilitator for code.org since 2018, starting with the Computer Science Principles (CSP) course. In 2022, he expanded his facilitation role to include the Computer Science A (CSA) course. Matt's commitment to promoting equitable access to computer science education aligns with code.org's mission of ensuring that all students have the opportunity to learn and excel in this field.
