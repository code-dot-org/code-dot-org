Kathy has 16 years of elementary teaching experience and currently is an EdTech Facilitator, offering professional development and coaching to teachers in a 1:1 district.  This past year, she has also offered Code.org workshops to  K-8 teachers as part of the Cajon Valley Union School District partnership and now is also working with other districts and their principals to bring the Code.org curriculum to their sites.  Empowering teachers with the  Code.org curriculum, unplugged activities, and mutual enthusiasm for teaching computer science in their classrooms is a very rewarding experience.  Her passion for Code.org comes from the seamless way that it integrates computer science education with problem solving, critical thinking, persistence,and creativity - skills that transfer to all areas of our students' education.

**What teachers say about Kathy's workshops**
"This was by far the most informative and useful workshop I have ever attended. The opportunity to explore and discover, as well as to present and use the materials was exceptional. Although I will be retiring in a few years, I will be investigating how I can continue my career using code."

"Had a blast! Made a Saturday workshop totally worth it! Thank you for the resources!"

"One of the best workshops I have attended! Very interactive and useful."
