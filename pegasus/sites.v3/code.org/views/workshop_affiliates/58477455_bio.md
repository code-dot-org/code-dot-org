I live and teach in Omaha, Nebraska.  I am nearing the end of my 25th year in education, the first 22 teaching 7th grade Social Studies and the last 3 teaching 7th grade Computer Science.  I have degrees in Architectural Drafting(1993), Secondary Social Sciences(1997) and Educational Administration(2007).  I am married with a freshman in college and a freshman in high school.  I bowl and play softball in my spare time and cheer on my children in baseball and club swimming.
