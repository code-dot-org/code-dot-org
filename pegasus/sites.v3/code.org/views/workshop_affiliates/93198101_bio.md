My name is Tammy Glass. I currently work as a Statewide Computer Science Specialist for the state of Arkansas.  My passion areas within computer science are K-8 Integrated CS and AP CSP.  I love working with and helping teachers get excited about computer science. Prior to becoming a CS Specialist I taught in the public school for 15 years in various subjects K-12.  I spent the majority of those years teaching business education.  I believe that computer science should reach beyond the computer and enjoy finding unique and creative ways to introduce students to the content.  In my personal time I enjoy building puppets, running and spending time with family and friends.
