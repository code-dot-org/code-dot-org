Susan has been the Computer Science teacher at Santa Fe High School in Edmond, Oklahoma since 2011.  As a programmer in private industry, Susan brings real-world experience into the classroom, including an emphasis on the “soft-skills” that many industry leaders feel are missing from programmers who have previously entered the field.  In addition to teaching high school students, Susan has been involved in re-vamping her school district’s middle school TechLit requirements to include programming as a required part of the curriculum and is training the middle school educators on how to meet the new requirements in their classrooms.  Susan is passionate about ensuring that Computer Science is accessible to ALL students and is excited to begin this journey with Code.org to prepare educators to present Computer Science to their students.
