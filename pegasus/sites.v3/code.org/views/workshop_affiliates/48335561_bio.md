## Talitha Yawn[talitha.mathlady@gmail.com](mailto: talitha.mathlady@gmail.com)Talitha teaches math and computer science at the high school level in Middle Tennessee.  From the moment she completed her first workshop series with Code.org, she knew the curriculum was exactly what she needed!  After a few years of teaching Code.org's curriculum, she wanted to help other teachers learn it, just as her facilitators did.  She's been teaching a total of 16 years and seeks to grow computer science in her county and state.
