After earning her BS in Elementary Education from the University of Missouri-St. Louis, Eleanna became certified as an eMINTS teacher and taught 3rd grade for nine years in a 2:1 environment back when SMART Boards, digital cameras and laptops were cutting edge technology. eMINTS ignited her passion for empowering students with technology, so whe earned her Masters degree in Information Science and Learning Technology from Mizzou, with an emphasis on technology in schools and a certification as an online educator.  
She then moved into my current role of Innovation and Technology instructor in a rural district near St. Louis, MO. She teaches grades 6-8 and they explore anything from computer science to 3D modeling and printing, VR/AR, engineering, game design and more! She loves her job because she gets to push kids to be creative and solve problems both with and without technology.
She is also an instructional leader for Kode with Klossy summer camp and was a 2023 Code.org CS Leaders Award recipient.  Some other accolades are the Peabody Logos Leadership in Education and the METC STEM Educator of the Year awards.
