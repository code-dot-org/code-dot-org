Courtnay officially retired in June after teaching for 30 years in Colorado, and will be a part time RtI teacher beginning in August. Her last 16 years were in Kindergarten.  Courtnay used Code.org curriculum in the classroom and loved to watch young learners find different ways to learn and share knowledge.  She is excited to help other teachers implement this in their classrooms.
