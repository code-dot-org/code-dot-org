Rebecca graduated from BHSU in 2012 with a degree in Math and Chemistry Education. Learning is her passion and so she quickly went back to BHSU to earn her Master's in Curriculum and Instruction with an emphasis in Math Leadership. During her time in the classroom she kept taking courses to help her in developing strategies for student engagement, discourse, and feedback which she used to help create a co-taught math environment with blended learning strategies, and student choice. She has just completed her first year at TIE as a Learning Specialist where she has delved more into the computer science area. She has developed, built, and implemented 4 day STEM Camps for learners in rural areas grades Kindergarten to 8th Grade so that they are able to experience rigorous problem solving and coding tasks.
