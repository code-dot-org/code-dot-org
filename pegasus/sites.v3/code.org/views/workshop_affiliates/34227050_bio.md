## Dana Calfee[dcalfee@greensburg.k12.in.us](mailto: dcalfee@greensburg.k12.in.us)A graduate of Indiana University and junior high science teacher by day, my evenings are spent with family, dogs, and books. I am an avid reader of anything and can absorb a good read while fishing, kayaking, or waiting for my youngest teen to finish band rehearsal. I have a true passion for cognition and what makes 6th - 8th graders connect with each other and information in their environment. Removing obstacles to access is the name of my game whether it's opportunities in computer science or appreciating the value of problem solving in science. When I am not at school or supporting the marching band, I enjoy directing children in community theater and visiting with my dad who is perhaps one of the greatest teachers I know.
