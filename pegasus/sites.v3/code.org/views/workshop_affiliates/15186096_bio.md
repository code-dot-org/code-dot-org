Lee Calton teaches math and computer science at Eufaula High School in Eufaula, Alabama.  Lee loves teaching because of the many opportunities it provides for continual learning and growth. She is passionate about the success of all students and believes that every student has something unique and special to contribute to the learning environment. Lee seeks to inspire her students to be more interested in the process than the product by challenging them to ask questions and apply their learning in new and different ways.  Lee believes that the problem-solving and computational thinking skills developed and practiced in a CS course can fuel this interest, empowering students to become both better learners and better citizens.
