## Bryan Binkley

Bryan is the computer science teacher at Schuylkill Valley High School in Leesport, Pennsylvania. He has taught at SV since 2001 and has taught many different programming languages. He has been a part of the AP CSP program since 2015 when he attended a symposium funded by the NSF on introducing collaboration to this curriculum. He is ecstatic at how the AP CSP class has taken off at his school. Most of his computer science classes have between 5 and 10 students while 73 students signed up to participate in this new AP venture. Seeing the engagement and enthusiasm which the Code.org curriculum brought to this class was absolutely wonderful and he wishes now to be able to help pass this opportunity on to other teachers,"
