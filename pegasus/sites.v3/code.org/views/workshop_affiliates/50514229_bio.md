Matt teaches Computer Science in Flagstaff, Arizona at 7,000 feet elevation. Less than an hour from the Grand Canyon, Matt enjoys the outdoors including hiking and whitewater rafting.

At Flagstaff High School (FHS), Matt has been teaching Computer Science (and Math) since 2018,  though he has been an educator in various forms since the 1990's. Around year 2000, Matt worked as a programmer developing software for clients in the financial services industry.

Partly because of this experience, in 2019 FHS asked him to start a new computer science program for the students at the school. However, Matt is quick to remind people that you don't need a CS degree to teach computer science. Thanks to a Native American Code Writers grant and professional development funding from the Arizona Department of Education, Matt was able to bring the program from an initial 30 students enrolled to around 150 students in three years. 

Additionally, Matt takes pride in how FHS has supported the program and the continuing engagement of other teachers who want to learn more about computer science and how they can incorporate it in a cross-curricular manner.

Matt looks forward to working with you during your journey to advance computer science education in your school.
