Alana is a fifth grade math and science teacher in New York City. She has taught 2nd through 5th grade in NYC Public Schools for 11 years. She has successfully implemented Code.org’s 20-hour courses in her own classroom for the past two years and has seen firsthand how valuable the curriculum is and how much students love it. She has also organized and hosted an Hour of Code for the 600+ students in her elementary school with the help of her fifth grade students. Alana is a prime example of the fact that teachers who do not have a background in computer science can effectively teach the Code Studio courses at the elementary level. She is committed to ensuring all students have access to computer science education and to helping other K-5 educators in NYC and the surrounding areas to do the same.

**About Alana**

“This was the ABSOLUTE best PD ever! I not only enjoyed myself and gained much from the facilitators, but also felt that it was an open environment where we could discuss, as teachers, our concerns, thoughts and questions about implementing this in our schools. Thank you for the excellent leaders.”

“The facilitators were what made the workshop successful. Their teaching experience was evident in how they discussed implementing Code.org in the classroom and how they planned for us to experience the material.” - Mary M. from Glen Rock, NJ

“I was excited by the Hour of Code last year but did not have any PD. I already began preparing in early October but still found I wanted more information—the workshop day was outstanding on so many levels! Alana was well informed, kept things moving and made the experience fun seemingly effortlessly!” - Mary M. from Westbury, NY
