I am a high school Computer Science teacher at Amphitheater High School, a Title I school in Tucson, AZ. I began my career as a math teacher but have gradually shifted to full-time Computer Science in the last few years. I embraced the Code.org curriculum to teach AP Computer Science Principles and I'm excited to implement Computer Science Discoveries next year. I studied Mathematics & Computer Science at the University of Arizona and have taught programming and computer science topics at summer camps for the last 10 years. I'm looking forward to sharing strategies and resources with any teachers interested in developing computer science programs at their schools.
