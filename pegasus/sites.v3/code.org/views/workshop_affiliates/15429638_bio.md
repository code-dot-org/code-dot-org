Daniel is a high school Computer Science teacher from Tucson, AZ. He began his career as a math teacher but has been gradually shifted to full-time Computer Science in the last few years. He embraced the Code.org curriculum to teach AP Computer Science Principles and is excited to implement Computer Science Discoveries next year. Daniel studied Mathematics & Computer Science at the University of Arizona and has taught programming and computer science topics at summer camps for the last 10 years. He teaches at Amphitheater High School, a Title I school in Tucson AZ, and is looking forward to sharing strategies and resources with any teachers interested in developing computer science programs at their schools.
