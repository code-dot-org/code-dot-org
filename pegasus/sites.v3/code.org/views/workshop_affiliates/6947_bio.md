Over the past 25 years, I have taught Computer classes in two school districts: West Springfield and Chicopee, MA. I hold two Master’s Degrees: Elementary Education & Instructional Technology. I have recently retired and throughout the years, I have enjoyed the evolution that computer education has made and am intrigued each year how computers, applications, the internet and new devices continue to support each generation’s learning and preparation for the future. 

Fast forward to 2022 and here we are teaching all students the concepts of Computer Science! I look forward to facilitating workshops in CSF & CSD. I whole heartedly agree that Everyone Can Learn CS!
