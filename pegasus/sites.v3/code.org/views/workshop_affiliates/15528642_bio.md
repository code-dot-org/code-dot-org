After teaching math for 10 years, I began my CS teaching journey seven years ago when AP CSP was released. For the past two years I have taught exclusively CSP and CSA at Johnston High School in Johnston, Iowa. I began facilitating CSP four years ago and was able to participate in the Code.org CSA pilot this past school year. I love the Code.org curriculum and introducing Computer Science to a wide-range of students. 

My wife is also in education and our daughter will be entering 5th grade this fall. We like to cheer on the UNI Panthers and take advantage of the bike trails around the Des Moines area.
