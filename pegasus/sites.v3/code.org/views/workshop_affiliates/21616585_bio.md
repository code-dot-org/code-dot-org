Steve teaches computer science and is the Director of Instructional Technology at Divine Child High School in Dearborn, Michigan. He began teaching at Divine Child in 2000. While he started as a physics teacher, about ten years ago ago Steve brought the schoolâ€™s first computer science class to Divine Child when he developed a course around the Arduino microcontroller platform. Since then Steve has developed and taught an online course in Physical Computing and now also teaches AP Computer Science Principles. As a proponent of exposing as many students as possible to computer science, Steve is also actively working with core content teachers on ways to incorporate coding into their curricula.
