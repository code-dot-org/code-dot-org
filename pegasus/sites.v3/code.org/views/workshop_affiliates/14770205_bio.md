**What teachers say about Christen's workshops**

"She set a purpose for the importance of computer science instruction in the classroom." - Pleasant Hill, CA

"I felt as though Christen was incredibly conscious of the fact that all of us were there with varying levels of computer knowledge and understanding. She made sure that she kept a good pace and did not over load us with new content without allowing for think time and time for us to implement the new concepts." -Brentwood, CA

"I really enjoyed the workshop. Ms. Schwartz did a nice job making the material ""understandable"" especially for me since I came into the training with no background knowledge. She also provided many opportunities for the participants to explore the resources and dabble!" - Brentwood, CA
