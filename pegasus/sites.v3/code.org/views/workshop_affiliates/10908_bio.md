Owen is Professor of the Practice of Computer Science at Duke where he has taught in four decades and two millennia. He builds curricula and pedagogical approaches to teaching intended for broad adoption and adaptation. He taught high school for 7 years, including teaching the original AP Computer Science course in its first year. He received an National Science Foundation (NSF) Career award for introducing design patterns into undergraduate courses, was an inaugural recipient of the NSF/CISE Distinguished Education Fellow Award for emphasizing problem-oriented approaches, and is the PI for the NSF/College Board AP CS Principles project. He enjoys thinking, running, collaborating, and pushing limits gently.
