**What teachers are saying…**

“It was enlightening, enjoyable, and had a great mix of what I feel anyone would need to feel confident to start bringing computer science to the elementary level.”

“I arrived anxious about being able to teach the curriculum having no background in computer science. I left excited to begin teaching students using code.org activities.”

“This workshop was one of the most useful, relevant, and amazing PD opportunities I have ever experienced. The PASSION for teaching code to ALL students is embedded in all the videos, instruction, and materials. I can’t wait to start teaching my K-5 students.”
