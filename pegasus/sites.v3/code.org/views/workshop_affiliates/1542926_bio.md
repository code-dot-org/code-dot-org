**What teachers say about Chinma's workshops**

“It was enlightening, enjoyable, and had a great mix of what I feel anyone would need to feel confident to start bringing computer science to the elementary level.” - Rosemary B. from Wallingford, CT

“I arrived anxious about being able to teach the curriculum having no background in computer science. I left excited to begin teaching students using code.org activities.” - Nancy W. from East Granby, CT

“This workshop was one of the most useful, relevant, and amazing PD opportunities I have ever experienced. The PASSION for teaching code to ALL students is embedded in all the videos, instruction, and materials. I can’t wait to start teaching my K-5 students.” - Nancy S. from Newtown, CT
