## Natalie Ulloa[nulloa.cs@gmail.com](mailto: nulloa.cs@gmail.com)My name is Natalie Ulloa and I am an 8-12 Instructional Coach in my school district. I was born and raised in Costa Rica where I started my teaching journey. I graduated from Universidad de Costa Rica with a Bachelor’s degree in English and taught 1st and 2nd grade, high school, and Continuing Education courses at UCR. I moved to Iowa in 2005 and my professional journey as an educator in America has been very rewarding. My passion is instructional design and technology, and how these can assist the learning process. I love collaborating in all kinds of learning projects. I find every learning scenario fascinating.

I hold a 5-12 Spanish Endorsement and a Master’s of Science in Instructional Design and Technology from WIU. Recently, I accomplished one of my childhood dreams with a Computer Science Teaching endorsement from UNI. I plan to continue furthering my education.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, backyard Astronomy, and watching Sci-Fi shows. I am looking forward to working with you!
