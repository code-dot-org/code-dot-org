Linda Rich is a Math and Computer Science educator at Boyd County High School in Ashland, Kentucky.  She grew up near Charleston, West Virginia and attended Marshall University for undergraduate and graduate school.  Linda also attended Western Governors' University for a second Master's Degree.  Linda grew up around technology and education with her father being a computer science professor and mother being an elementary school teacher.  She taught herself several computer languages throughout high school and college but was dead set not to follow in her parents' footsteps.  Therefore, it was only fitting that she did exactly that and found the intersection of their careers for her own.  Linda is married with two sons and three dogs.  She likes to read scary books and watch scary movies for fun.  Linda likes to cross stitch pop culture and music items to hang around her house and she crochets when she can.
