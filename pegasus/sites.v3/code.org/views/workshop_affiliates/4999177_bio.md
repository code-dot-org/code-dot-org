I am passionate about computer science, especially in elementary school.  I started as a software developer and then became certified to teach computer science. I have been lucky to work as a technology/STEM integration specialist in several great elementary schools in Maryland.  I look forward to sharing the lessons I learned along the way with fellow educators.
