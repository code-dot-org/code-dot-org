## Calais Fossier[fossicl@nv.ccsd.net](mailto: fossicl@nv.ccsd.net)Teacher of 12 years. Bachelors in biology. Masters in curriculum development. National Board Certified! I love to learn and get awesome ideas/curriculum/strategies/etc. to bring back to my classroom. I am always trying to improve my craft. When I took AP csa back in HS I was turned off CS as a career for me because of the way it was taught (read the chapter do the program at the end of the chapter) this experience really pushed me to be the opposite type of teacher! When I was pulled into the code curriculum for teaching CS it was a whole new world. I love this curriculum and style of teaching, I hope to do it justice. Be excellent to each other!
