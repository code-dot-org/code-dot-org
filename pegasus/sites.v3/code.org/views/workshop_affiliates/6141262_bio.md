Renee teaches computer science at the middle school level in Central Ohio. She has spent over three decades in the public school classroom teaching a variety of subjects and grades ranging from 3rd through 8th. In 2016, her students' love of Hour of Code led her to apply for an opportunity to pilot CS Discoveries. After the pilot, she was invited to join the facilitator team and she started in that role during the summer of 2017. She loves to help teachers and students discover the way computer science uses both logic and soft skills to transform people from users of technology to creators of technology.
