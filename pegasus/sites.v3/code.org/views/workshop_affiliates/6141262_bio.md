Renee has spent 26 years in public school classrooms teaching grades 3rd through 8th.  The majority of those years have been spent teaching Language Arts with some years of Social Studies included.  She began her personal CS journey seven years ago by mentoring a FIRST Robotics Team with her husband at Reynoldsburg High School's eSTEM Academy.  Two years ago she tried Hour of Code with her own students at Hannah Ashton Middle School and that led her to pilot CS Discoveries with her 6th grade students as well as start an after-school robotics club.
