Chris Bartlo currently teaches computer science and mathematics at Wilson High School in Portland, Oregon. Chris has played a prominent role in expanding computer science education at the local and state levels by training K-12 teachers and helping develop and support a number of technology related programs. As a board member of the Oregon Computer Science Teachers Association, Chris has organized and taught at the SuperQuest series of conferences. As a guiding philosophy Chris believes it is essential to get exciting technology into student hands, but it is equally important to connect new technology to educators. Educators are the source of so much amazing creativity but they need support, time and access to technologies they might want to implement.
