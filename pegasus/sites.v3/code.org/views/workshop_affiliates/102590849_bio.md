Fatima teaches art, computer science, and keyboarding to students from kindergarten to ninth grade. Currently, she teaches Computer Science Discoveries and Computer Science Principles to middle and high schoolers in a private school in central Ohio.  She has also taught CS Fundamentals Express and has integrated Code.org into her art classes.  She has attended the amazing CSD and CSP professional development workshops.  She has a bachelor's degree in computer science but spent years homeschooling. Code.org has been instrumental in her transitioning back to the workforce and merging her love of teaching with computer science. This will be her first year as a facilitator but she is excited to share her experience with others.
