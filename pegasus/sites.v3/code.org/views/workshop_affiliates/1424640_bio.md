Ben is a product manager at Minerva, an undergraduate program that combines world travel with interdisciplinary study. Previously he designed educational activities for an elementary-age summer camp, taught computer science and math at the high school level, and worked as a computer programmer. He has been a reader for the AP Computer Science A exam and is involved in the development of the new AP Computer Science Principles course. His interest in computer science education also takes the form of two projects: Computational Thinking Illustrated (http://www.ctillustrated.com/) and I Learned to Program (http://ilearnedtoprogram.com/) both are resources for students and teachers to better understand the many roles and ways of thinking in the technology industry.

**What teachers say about Ben's workshops**

“This was such an amazing workshop! Ben was so knowledgeable and inspirational. I wish I could take more workshops with him!” - Krystina T. from Sunnyvale, CA

“I have always wanted to give a foundational exposure to my little guys but I did not think that I would ever be capable. The experience not only changed my attitude as a teacher but also as a learner. I had always assumed that I just wasn’t smart enough to understand computer science. Now, with this approach, I am learning right along with my students. I am SO excited! The experience has completely changed my confidence levels.” - Kristin U. from San Francisco, CA
