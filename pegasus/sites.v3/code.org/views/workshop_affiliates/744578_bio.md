**What teachers are saying…**

“The materials are excellent, the session was fun, the presenters were so knowledgeable and experienced. It was unusual that it seemed as though the attendees shared similar experience levels, and expertise, allowing the workshop to maximize time and move at a good pace.”

“The presenters were amazing and well informed. I absolutely loved all the hands-on practice and collaboration.”
