Steve is the manager of technology/curriculum integration at the Contra Costa County Office of Education in Pleasant Hill, California, where he has worked since 2004.  In that role, he has employed his programming skills as he maintained and developed a customizable web portal with educational resources for students and teachers in multiple California counties to use in the classroom and at home.  He has provided professional development to preK-12 classroom teachers, school and district administrators around technology integration and computerized assessments. He also co-facilitates two countywide curriculum subcommittees. One of his favorite opportunities is training new teachers in educational technology through the county teacher induction program.

Steve has believed that computer science should be available to everyone, even before his young daughter told him she wanted to be a ballerina-astronaut and to ""build a bridge to space and sleep on it!"" He is eager to support others as they work to make CS for all a reality.
