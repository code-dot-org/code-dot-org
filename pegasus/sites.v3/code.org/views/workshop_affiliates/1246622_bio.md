**What teachers are saying…**

“All elementary teachers need to take this workshop! The Code.org curriculum is what education needs. It is easy to follow and implement and makes computer science accessible and fun!”

“One of the best workshops I have ever attended! The curriculum is awesome. I especially loved the format of the workshop. I not only got to engage in the lessons but practice teaching them as well. I came away with the confidence that I could actually teach computer science to my students!”
