Jennifer is a math and computer science teacher at Pocahontas County High School in rural West Virginia, where she teaches AP Computer Science Principles and Computer Science A.  She started coaching for her schoolâ€™s first ever robotics team in 2018, and has become best known for bringing homemade cookies to every tournament. Jennifer likes computer science because it involves multiple interesting ways of solving a puzzle. She believes that all students, even those in small schools, should have access to computer science education to help them think through a challenge and learn problem solving skills. She is a member of the Mountaineer Master Mathematics Teachers network, and was named the WVCTM Secondary Math Teacher of the Year in 2020.  In her spare time, Jennifer enjoys hiking in the surrounding state parks and national forests, reading a wide variety of books, and playing many table top and video games with her husband Chris.
