## Adriana Ocana-Lara[aocana@osc.org](mailto: aocana@osc.org)I am an Education Specialist at the Orlando Science Center, where I have worked for the past 3 years designing different programs like professional development for teachers and afterschool programs for middle school students related to aviation and makerspace topics. My background in Coastal Marine Biology, Art and Museum Studies have helped me work in different types of museums from science to anthropology and history, gaining invaluable experiences. I am from Puerto Rico, where I started as an informal educator over 7 years ago, and I moved to Orlando to work at the science center. OSC introduced me to Code.org as soon as I became part of the education team, and this is why I am very excited to assist teachers in the implementation of CS Discoveries curricula in their classrooms.
