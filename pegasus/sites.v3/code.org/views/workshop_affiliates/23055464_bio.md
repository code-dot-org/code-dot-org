I am a Computer Science teacher at Russell Area Technology Center in Russell, KY. I have been teaching for 14 years, the last three of which I have been teaching Computer Science exclusively. Before that I taught all business classes for the first 7 years, and then a hybrid of Computer Science and Business courses after receiving my Rank I in Educational Technology. I attended a Code.org workshop in 2017, and learned how easy it is to use and follow Code.org curriculum! I have used Code.org for AP CSP each year I have taught the course, and I fit in other Code.org curriculum wherever I can! I love that it is easy to follow for the teacher and the students. The other courses that I teach are Computational Thinking, Digital Literacy, Python, Java, and Computer Literacy.
