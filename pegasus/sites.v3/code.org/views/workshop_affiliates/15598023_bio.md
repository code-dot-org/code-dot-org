I have been a high school teacher for over 30 years, and I have taught computer science and programming all but one year. I have a bachelor of science degree in mathematics with a minor in computer science and statistics. I then earned a master of education degree in secondary education at Arizona State University. A lot has changed in computer science since I wrote my first program on punch cards in the early 1980s. I have done my best to keep up with the changes and learn new things every year. I have a passion for computer science and its purpose in today's society. I love programming and enjoy helping others learn this valuable skill.
