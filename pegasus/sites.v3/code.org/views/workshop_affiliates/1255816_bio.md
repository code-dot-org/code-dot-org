Daniel Pearson is a Computer Science and Computer Art teacher at Castle Park HS in Chula Vista, CA. He has been teaching CSP for a number of years, CSD for 2, and occasionally teaches CSA. He is an AVID cyclist, but has taken to riding indoors using online platforms like Zwift or iFit over the past few years. He has pedaled over 11,000 miles on Zwift since he started using it June 2020. He completed his first Spartan Sprint with his wife and 2 daughters this past April, and despite some bruises, and many sore muscles, they all agreed to do another one. In between taking his daughters to dance classes, he might be found on Mission Bay paddling his SUP, or on Fiesta Island riding in circles.
