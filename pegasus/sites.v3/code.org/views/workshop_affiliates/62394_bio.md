Lisa teaches Business Education and Computer Science to high school students in Northwest Missouri. Lisa first found Code.org when she began teaching 10 years ago. She has taken the CSP, CSD, and CSA training through Code.org and has learned to love teaching computer science. She feels using the Code.org curriculum makes it easy for someone like her, who has never taken a computer science class before teaching one, to successfully teach it. Lisa became a teacher after working in the corporate world and, if you had asked her then, she would have said there was no way she was qualified to teach computer science! She has learned about computer science right along with the students and it is now one of her favorite classes to teach.
