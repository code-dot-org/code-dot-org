## Wanda Vinson[ms.wvinson@gmail.com](mailto: ms.wvinson@gmail.com)Ms Vinson is a 20 year educator with a natural curiosity, love of learning and she is passionate about all things tech. She began coding with the original Hour of Code in December of 2013, making her first snowman winter holiday card!  That beginning came with a fear of the unknown and a lack of confidence, having done poorly in all her computer science courses in college.  Then came Code.org to inspire new ways to learn and instill a confidence that ensures technological success. Today, Ms. Vinson is thrilled to introduce coding not only to students Kindergarten through 5th grade, but also to co-workers and fellow teachers around the country.
