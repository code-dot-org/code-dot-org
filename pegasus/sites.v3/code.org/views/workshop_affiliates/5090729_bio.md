## Valerie Coniff[valerie.coniff@d51schools.org](mailto: valerie.coniff@d51schools.org)Val has taught computer science classes for 12 years in Grand Junction, Colorado at Bookcliff Middle School and taught math for 6 years before that. She loved when her district changed curriculum from computer applications to computer science. The students have loved the code.org curriculum and so does she. The students are engaged, and the curriculum is so much fun to teach! The students see the real world applications and have so much choice in what they can create! She feels very lucky to be teaching in a district that truly values computer science and makes it available for all students! For the first time in her 12 years of teaching computers, her district has created and is implementing a K-12 Computer Science curriculum! In her spare time Val likes to be in the mountains. Hiking, camping or just sitting around a camp fire.
