I have been teaching Computer Science at the University of Louisiana at Monroe for 20+ years. I have collaborated with teachers in the Northeast Louisiana region through LaSIP Math/Science partnerships, and conducted CS summer camps for middle school students with Young Scholars and Explorers Camps. I am always looking for ways to promote CS for all and Code.org is the perfect way to do so. I have been a fan of Code.org since the Hour of Code was introduced. I look forward to diving into Code.org curriculum such as CS Principles with teachers throughout Louisiana, working in conjunction with our regional partner, Louisiana State University.
