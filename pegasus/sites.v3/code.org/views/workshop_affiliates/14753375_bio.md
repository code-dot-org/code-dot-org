**What teachers say about James's workshops**

"I love taking classes from James. I was in his ISTE session this summer and loved they way he really brought the focus to my teaching and how to be reflective and how to be better. This session was the same and did not disappoint! I love how James had us up and moving as well as reflecting on best practice."
