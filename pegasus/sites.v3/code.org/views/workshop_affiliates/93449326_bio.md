I have spent my entire teaching career in the Gifted and talented classroom. I am currently a educator of 2nd Gifted and Talented children.  I have been using code.org in my gifted classroom for the last 3-4 years.  I utilized it as part of STEM curriculum in my classroom.  I love the code.org program and have enjoyed bringing it to my classroom.
