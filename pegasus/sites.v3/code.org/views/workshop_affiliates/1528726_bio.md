## Dani McAvoy

Dani is a computer science teacher at Worcester Academy in Worcester, Massachusetts. She graduated from Bowdoin College with a BA in Computer Science and Math Education. At Worcester Academy, Dani is building the computer science program. The program went from less than 20 students the first year to over 80 students the second year! She attributes a lot of this growth to the Hour of Code, which allowed her to expose her entire school to computer science. Recently Dani received the National Center for Women and Informational Technology’s Aspirations in Computing Educator Award for her work. Dani is very excited to get to work with teachers in the New England area to help bring computer science to more elementary school classrooms.

“The workshop helped me to understand how to use hands-on activities in addition to work on the computer with students. Dani, our facilitator, was well-informed and wonderful to work with.” - Donna S. from South Burllington, VT

“I loved my facilitator! I thought Dani did an amazing job creating a comfortable environment for all of the teachers to learn from her! She was honest and ignited important conversations and ideas within each group. She also tied in the videos which I think also was engaging. Overall, she delivered a great workshop.” - Amy M. from Shrewsbury, MA
