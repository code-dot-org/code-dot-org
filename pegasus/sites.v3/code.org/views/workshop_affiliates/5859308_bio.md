Adam Mack has a M.A. Ed. in Special Education and lives in South Florida where he was born and raised. Immediately after graduation, he taught at an inner-city middle school teaching science. Looking for ways to engage both his ELL and Special Needs students, he looked at robotics engineering and programming and won a small grant to fund his ideas. Soon after that, he led his middle school to host the first ever District State Qualifying competition.  Seeing the huge impact his program had on his students, he earned his certification in pre-engineering and career and technology education. Adam transferred to a new school, where he began teaching engineering and computer classes, including programming and Cisco Networking Academy. He later drew on his background in security management and began teaching cybersecurity, helping his students compete in the Cyber Patriot annual competitions.  For the last five years he has been actively training teachers and administrators in computer science engineering and programming, helping to engage struggling students to improve their education. He is a strong advocate for increasing student success using project- and problem-based learning in technology.
