Rebecca has taught K-12 Computer Science for ten years and is excited to share her love of computer science and learning. Computer Science can unlock creativity and curiosity in all of us, regardless of our background or experience. She believes all students and teachers should be given computer science 'super powers' and have the opportunity to see themselves as future computer scientists!
