In addition to being a facilitator for Code.org, I am also a Library Media Specialist with the Knox County R-1 School District in Northeast Missouri.  I have been in this position for three years now, having previously been in the elementary classroom for eleven years.  In the library, students are regularly taught coding, robotics, Novel Engineering, and have access to a fully functioning MakerSpace.  I believe that all students should have the choice to learn and use coding during their education and that it is the language of the future.
