In addition to being a Code.org facilitator, she is also a PBS Digital Innovator, Tynker Blue Ribbon Educator, and littleBits Lead Educator. Paige currently teaches grades 2 - 5 Digital “Techknowledgy” and Gifted & Talented. Prior to becoming a teacher, Paige worked in the nonprofit sector tracking employment trends. Her area of expertise is preparing students for career readiness. Paige's mission is to provide all students with access to computer science and STEAM.

Paige’s motto is “If You Can Dream it, You Can Make it”.
