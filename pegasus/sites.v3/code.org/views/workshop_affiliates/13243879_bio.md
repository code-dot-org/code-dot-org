Since becoming a CS Discoveries Facilitator in 2017, David has had the
opportunity to travel from coast to coast facilitating over a dozen
different five-day workshops in multiple states. In addition, as an
original CS Discoveries Virtual Facilitator prior to the pandemic in 2019,
he was able to pioneer the virtual workshop format providing CS training to
teachers from Alaska to Texas. His favorite things about being a CS
Discoveries Facilitator are the invaluable professional relationships, both
with the incredibly dedicated and effective Code.org staff, as well as the
hundreds of fellow teacher’s with whom he’s been able to collaborate both
virtually and in person. When he isn’t facilitating coding workshops, David
can be found in Ogden, Utah, working with students and teachers throughout
the Ogden School District as a STEM Specialist."
