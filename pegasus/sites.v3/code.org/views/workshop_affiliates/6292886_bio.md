**What teachers say about Elizabeth's workshops**

"The Code.org workshop solidified the importance of computer science being taught and utilized in our schools. In order to be college and career ready, we need to work diligently to close the gaps within the field of computer science. This professional development experience surely aligns with my beliefs and values about teaching computer science. In closing, this enlightening workshop/course should become part of the college course requirements for education majors."

"This was the BEST professional development I've ever been to! It made me excited about teaching again. It was so much fun! This workshop made me want to explore the possibility of being an elementary computer sciences teacher."
