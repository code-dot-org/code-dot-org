I am passionate about learning and education and the intersection with schooling. I am always open to learning new things, and often have several learning experiences going at the same time (juggling, playing bass, learning computer science, and electrical wiring are currently on my playlist). My work experience in education has spanned from teaching traditional and non-traditional high school and career & tech ed, to school design coaching/consulting across the country, being a professional learning facilitator, to my current work at the Vermont Agency of Education, supporting personalized learning, and flexible pathways. Driven in part by the presence of two young learners that my partner (and I) homeschool, I am particularly fascinated with the way that learning computational thinking at an early age complements young childrenâ€™s own development process and leverages their natural proclivity to test boundaries, explore variables, and develop basic logic operations. Ancora imparo!
