I started with EduTech as an Information Technology Specialist in early 2022.  My enthusiasm for teaching started in graduate school where I enjoyed the challenge of inspiring interest in STEM and technology among students majoring in other subjects.  After completing my Ph.D. in geoscience, I earned a Masters of Education and taught high school science and technology for 4 years.  Continued interest in Computer Science and Cyber Security brought me to Fargo, where I am engaging in efforts to promote computer science in schools â€“ and EduTech is a great fit toward that goal!  I am excited to grow with the  EduTech team promoting CS education and continuing my life-long journey in STEM education.
