## Astra Zeno

Astra Zeno has enjoyed teaching math, science, robotics, aerospace, marine science, technology applications, engineering and computer science over her fifteen years of teaching. Through guest speakers, field trips and competitions, Ms. Zeno supplements each lesson with interactive activities.  She seeks out opportunities and encourages her students to take risks by participating in numerous district and city-wide competitions and challenges.   Astra was especially proud to teach a Girls Exploring Engineering (GEE) class, where young women were introduced to engineering and computer science through project learning that included everything from modern dance to programming mobile robots. She now teaches computer science at an all-girls school and coaches several all girls robotics teams after school, emphasizing that all team members learn to code.  Astra was pleased to be the first in Texas to partner with the Microsoft TEALS program to offer the inaugural AP Computer Science classes at Young Womenâ€™s College Preparatory Academy.
