## Darlease Monteiro[dmonteiro@glcps.org](mailto: dmonteiro@glcps.org)I started teaching after working in retail for many years.  Originally, I began teaching Math and Science for grades 5 thru 8.  When the position for a Technology Specialist opened in my school, I jumped at the opportunity because I enjoyed working with technology and integrating into my classes.  As they say, the rest is history. 

I have been attending Code.org workshops for many years and enjoy teaching the curriculum.  I learn as much as the students every year.  I work in a school that allows me to be creative and try new things all the time which helps keep my creative juices flowing.
I like period films and hope to one day figure out how to incorporate a movie theme into my classes.
