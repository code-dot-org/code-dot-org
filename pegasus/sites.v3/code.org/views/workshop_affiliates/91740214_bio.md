Stuart is a retired teacher with professional experience as a classroom teacher, curriculum specialist, librarian, and technology integration specialist. He believes in creativity, purposeful learning, positivity, and critical thinking practices. Stuart hopes that teachers embrace new challenges with courage and an openness to acknowledge that “teaching hiccups” are part of the learning process. After years of being in education, his deepest belief is that we are teaching kids for their futures, which means we sometimes abandon learning processes that were part of our past. Learning about computer science and the work at code.org caused that aha moment in Stuart; he saw how critical thinking and problem solving are the foundation of these learning experiences. Stuart believes the thinking students experience with code.org transfers to other subjects, especially math. Last, if you're looking to further implement the four C's in your classroom, this is a brilliant resource!
