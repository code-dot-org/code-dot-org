Kelley has recently completed her 10th year of teaching. Her background in project based learning helped her leap into STEAM and computer science education. She believes that coding encourages students to become problem solvers, creators, critical thinkers and team players. She couldn't be more excited to be a part of Code.org and their mission to help expose more teachers and students to the power of computer science.
