Kaitie is a math and computer science teacher near Minneapolis, MN.  In college, Kaitie had to take a computer science class for her math major and was shocked to find out that she like, or was even good at, computer science.  Since then, she has been determined to ensure all students had some experience with computer science in K-12 education.  Kaitie started doing Hour of Code since her first year teaching and in Fall of 2015, she started teaching her first computer science principles course at Mounds View High School.  She believes that the world needs more collaborative problem solvers and aims to instill the values of collaboration and persistent problem solving in her computer science classes.  Kaitie is excited to see computer science grow in schools and hopes to build a strong community of computer science teachers to support new and experienced computer science teachers.
