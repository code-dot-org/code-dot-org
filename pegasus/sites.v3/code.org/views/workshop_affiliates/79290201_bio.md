Teaching our young ones the ability to think critically in an increasingly technological world is an imperative of Mr. Blalockâ€™s approach to teaching science. Only by having an educated and discerning citizenry will we be able to choose the right applications of scientific knowledge and ultimately create a more sustainable and just society.
