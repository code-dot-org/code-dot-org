## Lois Byars[lbyars@lexington1.net](mailto: lbyars@lexington1.net)Lois Byars just finished her 31st year in education AND is still lovin/ it! She has taught 3rd through 8th grades. She is currently part of a Design department at an International Baccalaureate middle school where she teaches computer science and design thinking within the Innovation Lab. Her love for CS comes directly from her studentsâ€™ responses way back in 2013 during the first Hour of Code. Like she tells her students daily, CS knows no age limit and allows you to make a difference now!
