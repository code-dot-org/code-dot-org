**What teachers are saying…**

“I LOVED the workshop! My instructor was very knowledgeable and the layout of the day was very organized. I especially loved the Teacher, Learner, Observer section of the day. It was neat to see how everyone would teach the different lessons. I also loved the Swag bag! Thanks for sharing with us. I am going to utilize the information I learned in my lessons this week for my second graders! They are going to be pumped about the puzzles! Thanks so much for offering this to educators!”
