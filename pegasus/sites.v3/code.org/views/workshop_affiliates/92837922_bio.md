Dan was a 5th grade classroom teacher for 8 years before starting in a newly created "Technology" special for his school. He learned about "computer science" through a Code.org training that he attended and decided to use this framework to build his class. He now teaches all students from kindergarten through 5th grade on what computers are, how they work, on digital citizenship skills, and how people can use computers to change the world.
