I have been in education for 27 years. I began my career by teaching science, biology and anatomy, for 17 years and then decided to assist high school students plan their future by becoming a high school counselor.  As a high school counselor, I discovered the need for students to explore computer science options as careers.  I love helping students see their potential to achieve lifetime goals.
My husband and I have two children and one grandson. We love adventures and spending time with our family.
