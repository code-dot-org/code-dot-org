I have been teaching high school in Missouri for 27 years and part time with a Community College for 13 years.  My teaching schedule is a mix of math, computer science, and even a business class. We implemented Computer Science Principles into our high school in 2018. I have taught the class as a class, independent study, and even virtual. It is a class that is continually growing in our school. My passion is teaching! I love to interact, engage, and encourage students to show them they CAN do math and CIS!

I graduated from Wichita State University with a Bachelors in Mathematics, minor in Business Administration and a teaching degree. Then obtained my masters from Missouri State University in Business Administration.
