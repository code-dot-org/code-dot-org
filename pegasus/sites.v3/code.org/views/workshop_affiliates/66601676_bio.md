After graduating from Montana State University with a BS in Technology Education I taught for 11 years and then choose to pursue a MS in Engineering Technology at Central Washington University. This journey has provided me with opportunities to work with and support students in Pre-K thru higher-education settings. For over 20 years I have taught Technology Education, Math, PLTW, Engineering, CS, and STEM - Teacher Ed. in Oregon and Washington public schools. Involvement in Skills USA, TSA, FIRST, VEX, Battlebots, and ATMAE clubs have been my passion and help to keep me innovative and forward thinking as an educator.

With the turns and challenges of Covid, I choose to return to Montana where I am building new courses in CS, Architecture, Engineering and Technology at my school.  This adventure is also paired with returning to the family farm after 30 years and currently building a house with my son (13) for our family of 5, 1 dog, 4 rabbits, and many future farm animals.
