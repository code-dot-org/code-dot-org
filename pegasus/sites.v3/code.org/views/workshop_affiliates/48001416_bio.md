## Nick Nohner[nnohner@gmail.com](mailto: nnohner@gmail.com)Nick Nohner has been teaching since 2010 and has been teaching computer science since 2014. He attended Gonzaga University with a degree in mathematics. He is currently teaching math and computer science in Portland Oregon. Nick has loved giving the students the chance to create and explore in his class. Like many new computer science teachers he did not have extensive background with the content, but was ready to learn with his students. It's no surprise that his student's problem solving and creativity took the driver's seat and it's been a great journey ever since. He is looking forward to supporting new teachers the way he was.
