**What teachers say about Evelyn's workshops**

"This was the best professional development I've attended in a long time. Evelyn was a fabulous presenter who was very knowledgeable, kept the pace moving, and used various proven methods of instruction. Anyone who can keep the attention of teachers knows what they are doing. I'm excited about using the curriculum in our school. Thank you for this valuable resource and a great day of training."
