**What teachers say about Evelyn's workshops**

"This was the best professional development I've attended in a long time. Evelyn was a fabulous presenter who was very knowledgeable, kept the pace moving, and used various proven methods of instruction. Anyone who can keep the attention of teachers knows what they are doing. I'm excited about using the curriculum in our school. Thank you for this valuable resource and a great day of training."

"Very good way to spend a whole Saturday learning about computer science/coding. Excellent professional development. Have been sharing with teachers, students, administration. Would like to see this professional development course offered again in our district. Loved the Trainer. Thank you."

"This was one of the best workshops I've ever attended. It was engaging and time passed too quickly. I was delighted with the training and manual, impressed with the awesome lunch, and spoiled with the Code.org swag!"
