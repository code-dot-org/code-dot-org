My name is Ashley Hawkins. I was born and raised in Mobile, Alabama, but I am now a resident of Biloxi, Mississippi. I am a part of the Biloxi Public Schools' Indian Nation and teach at Back Bay Elementary. I have bachelor’s degrees in both Early Childhood Education and Elementary Education from the University of Alabama. I am currently pursuing a master’s degree in Educational Leadership- Administration from Arkansas State University. I have been a kindergarten teacher since 2017 and I also have experience teaching STEM (K-2). I am a member and trainer for the Mississippi Computer Science Task Force. I do not have any children, but I do have a perfect dog. She is a whippet and her name is Sadie Mae. I played college softball so love being around and watching all types of sporting events. When I am not teaching littles, I love to travel and spend time with my family.
