**What teachers are saying…**

“This was a great workshop. I learned a lot and appreciated the opportunity to be able to work through the curriculum as my students would be doing so I can understand what they are being asked to do. I was thrilled to finally participate in a workshop that was run for teachers in the manner in which we were engaged learners!”

“Coding is out of my element, and scares me a bit. Ben did a great job of making the lessons understandable, and helped me think about differentiating lessons so all areas of the curriculum can be involved.”
