I work for Oklahoma Public School Resource Center co-managing the Code.org regional partnership in Oklahoma.  I also travel around Oklahoma leading professional development workshops for teachers.  Prior to this position, I was an elementary teacher for 13 years.  I taught first grade, third grade, and elementary computer science.  When I taught elementary computer science, CS Fundamentals was our primary curriculum.  I'm a huge Code.org fan and want to see it being utilized by every school in our state!
