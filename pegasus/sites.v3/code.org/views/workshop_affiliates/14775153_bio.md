Lori is a K-12 STEM Outreach Educator with 12 years of experience in the secondary mathematics classroom.  In her role as a STEM Educator, Lori enjoys coming alongside teachers to help them get excited and feel confident about implementing STEM initiatives in their classrooms.  She thinks it is important to deepen relationships with teachers and schools through continued availability and involvement after their workshop.

Even during her time as a mathematics teacher, Lori's primary goal was to help her students learn how to think!  In her opinion, nothing better prepares students for lifelong learning than developing the habits of critical thinking and persevering in problem solving, and nothing lays the foundation for these two habits better than the implementation of computer science fundamentals at the elementary level.
