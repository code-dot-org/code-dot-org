## Teresa Hintze[Hintze_Teresa@asdk12.org](mailto: Hintze_Teresa@asdk12.org)The 2019/2020 school year will be my 20th year of teaching.  For the first 15 years of my career I taught deaf education grades K-12.  For the past four years I have been teaching at a homeschool charter school.  When the opportunity arose to figure out how to bring CS to the homeschool classroom, I jumped at the opportunity. Although I have always been adept at using technology in the classroom, this is the first time I've immersed myself into the coding side of computers.
