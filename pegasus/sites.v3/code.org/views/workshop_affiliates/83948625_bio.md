Amy has been an educator for the past 15 years.  She began her career teaching middle school science and eventually transitioned to high school where she taught biology, chemistry and forensics.  After almost 10 years in the classroom, Amy became a curriculum specialist with her former district where she supported colleagues with the implementation of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).  She is currently the curriculum specialist for science with the Sacramento County Office of Education and was recently given the opportunity to expand her knowledge of all things computer science.  She currently enjoys supporting teachers who are new to computer science and providing opportunities for girls and underrepresented youth to learn more about computer science.
