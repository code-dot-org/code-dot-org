Michelle teaches Middle School Computer Science and Earth Science in the Paradise Valley Unified School District. She is a Graduate of the University of Arizona with a degree in Biochemistry and Math who recently discovered her passion for coding. It is with this discovery that she is able to teach Coding to every student in her Middle School while expanding her knowledge simultaneously. She loves the fact that she can have her students complete experiments just as real scientists using experimental test beds.

Michelle spends her spare time with her 4 kids and husband at swim meets, hiking and on an ongoing quest for new adventure. Her two middle children are both in college and are beginning to code as well and hope to incorporate it into their future careers.

**What teachers say about Michelle's workshops**
"I really liked the active environment and the consistent support from the facilitators. Great day!" Christie, Phoenix

"I liked how we Collaborated with others, completed the unplugged first and then did the plugged version, that fit nicely together. The Facilitators were great and they made a hard concept easy. I am excited to use in my classroom" Amy, Phoenix
