I teach computer science classes at the high school level in North Carolina. I love using Code.org curriculum with all my classes. I had the opportunity to pilot the Computer Science A. I learned JavaScript and Java first hand and have watch the development and updates of Computer Science Principles and Computer Science A. I received my master's in Instructional Technology and have used my skills to develop courses on most LMS platforms and continue using it in my teaching career today.
