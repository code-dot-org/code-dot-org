Wendy is the computer teacher at Greenfield Middle School in Greenfield, Wisconsin. She has been teaching middle school computer-based courses since receiving her Master's Degree in Instructional Technology in 2004.  She also taught French for 12 years and still tries to use it when she can (although it's true what they say...when you don't use it, you lose it!).  Her love for technology has always kept her searching for great resources to keep her instruction and her students' learning fresh and fun. When she came across Code.org in its infancy, she immediately recognized what an asset it could be in the classroom.  For the past four years, she has been expanding her use of coding with her students using Code Studio and Scratch.  A huge believer in the mission of Code.org, Wendy is thrilled to to be working with Code.org to help to increase Computer Science instruction in schools.
