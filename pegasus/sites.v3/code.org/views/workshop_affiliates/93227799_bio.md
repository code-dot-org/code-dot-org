Michee received her Bachelor of Science in education from Louisiana Tech University.  She has taught various subjects and grades for the last twenty years at Ruston Elementary School in Ruston, Louisiana.  She started to teach coding skills to students in grades 3-5 in the 2022-2023 school year.  Michee is thrilled to use the code.org curriculum with her students to foster their problem-solving skills, critical thinking skills, and their perseverance.  Teaching these coding skills to students, early on, will open up a world of opportunities and create bright futures for them.
