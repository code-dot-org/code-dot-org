## Rob Breshears[rbreshea@psdschools.org](mailto: rbreshea@psdschools.org)I am from Fort Collins, CO where I teach CS at Poudre High School.  I have a dozen years as an educator under my belt but only 3 in CS and Code.org has been amazing for me and my students.  I have also been know to hike, camp, swim, play guitar, play with my kids, go on dates with my wife, coach swimming, wrestle grizzly bears, play yard games and surf.  I am also a really average fantasy football player.
