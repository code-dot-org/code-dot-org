**About Lionel**

“One of the biggest thing that I got out of the coding workshop was the sharing of knowledge that other people in the group had. What worked and what didn’t work. What the students really loved in the coding program and some of the trick that worked best. The facilitators were professional and shared with the group.” - Mary B. from Far Rockaway, NY

“I think the workshop is great as is. The presenters at this particular workshop were so helpful and had great ideas for presenting material in an engaging way and making adaptations for students with special needs.” - Calianne B. from Fresh Meadows, NY
