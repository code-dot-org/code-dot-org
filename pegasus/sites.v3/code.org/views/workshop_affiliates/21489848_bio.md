She also has a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Christian Education from Macedonia Bible College, and a Diploma in Public Service in Early Childhood Development from Central Carolina Technical College. 

Amy learned about Code.org in 2017, and fell in love with the way it made Computer Science concepts clear for students without a CS background. She became a facilitator in 2018.
