Michael Kmietowicz is the Education Specialist of Afterschool Programs at the Orlando Science Center. He has a Bachelor of Science in Molecular Biology and Microbiology with a minor in Chemistry from the University of Central Florida. Michael has worked at the Orlando Science Center since February 2012. In that time, he has worked to inspire students of all ages to pursue their passions in the STEM fields. Some of his favorite programs have been those that have a technological component, including 3D printing, soldering, computer programming, and robotics. He strongly believes that computer science should be accessible to ALL students who would like to learn. He is very excited to begin sharing the Project GUTS program to Central Florida educators so that their students may learn about science in a whole new way.
