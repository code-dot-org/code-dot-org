**What teachers are saying…**

“This was a fantastic workshop! Adam is an excellent teacher - extremely knowledgeable and extremely engaging, which is a combination that seems difficult to find in computer science. I would gladly devote another Saturday if additional workshops were offered.”

“Adam was GREAT! I have a limited background in computer science and this program is so teacher friendly as well as appealing to students. I plan to use my summer vacation to align my current pass objectives with Code.org because I know once we start, my students will be hooked just as I am. I also have been inspired to start an after school club to encourage girls to explore the field of computer science.”
