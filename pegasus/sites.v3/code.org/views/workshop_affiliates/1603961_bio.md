Sharon is a Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Curriculum Coordinator and former high school mathematics teacher of 18 years for the Westerly Public School District in Rhode Island. With degrees in mathematics and engineering, she has presented at national and regional conferences on early numeracy and response to intervention. Sharon currently serves on the board of the National US Math Recovery Council and is a member of RI-CSTA, CSTA, RI-MTA and NCTM. Sharon believes strongly in the need to embed computational thinking throughout all K-12 curriculum and believes this will be accomplished by providing professional development and tools to teach computer science to teachers and students. Sharon believes that through Code.org’s K-5 curriculum, teachers will have the tools and knowledge they need to make computational thinking and learning transparent and transferrable to all students.
