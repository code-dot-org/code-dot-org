Sharon is a Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Curriculum Coordinator and former high school mathematics teacher of 18 years for the Westerly Public School District in Rhode Island. With degrees in Mathematics and Engineering, she has presented at national and regional conferences on early numeracy, response to intervention and coding. Sharon served on the National US Math Recovery BOD for three years and is a member of RI-CSTA, CSTA, RI-MTA and NCTM. Sharon believes strongly in the need to embed computational thinking throughout all K-12 curriculums and believes this will be accomplished by providing professional development and tools to teach computer science to teachers and students. Sharon believes that through Code.org’s K-5 curriculum, teachers will have the tools and knowledge they need to make computational thinking and learning transparent and transferable to all students.
