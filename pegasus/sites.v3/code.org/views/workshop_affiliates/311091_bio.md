Mike is the technology teacher at Falmouth Elementary School in Falmouth, Maine. Falmouth Elementary School has been his home since 2008 and he has been teaching in the school’s computer lab since 2012. Computer science is one of Mike’s passions, and programming has always been part of his curriculum. Mike studied computer engineering in college and was fortunate to attend a high school that offered programming classes. He firmly believes all students should have access to computer science education, beginning at the elementary level. Mike has first-hand experience teaching the Code Studio courses to hundreds of K-5 students. He is excited to help teachers prepare to introduce this vital content to their students.

**About Mike**

“I feel like the program is easily manageable, but I also feel like I can contact the presenter, Mike, with any questions or concerns. I really liked that the training was on a small scale, because it made it easy for each person’s individual needs to be met.” - Jodi J. from Springvale, ME

“It was obvious how much time Mr. Harvey put into preparing for each of the classes. The instructor’s passion for the content of this workshop was contagious. I learned a great deal and feel empowered to share this learning with students.” - Jennifer M. from North Yarmouth, ME
