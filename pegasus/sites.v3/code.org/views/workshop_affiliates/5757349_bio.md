John McDonald has been teaching Science, Engineering and Technology at Rossville Middle School since 2005. He came to teaching after working for nine years as a technical sales representative and operations manager. This work experience taught him the importance of computational thinking and computer programming, skills he teaches in his Engineering and Technology classes. He has seen first-hand how real-world design and problem solving can teach these critical skills while engaging students in their coursework and preparing them for future careers.
