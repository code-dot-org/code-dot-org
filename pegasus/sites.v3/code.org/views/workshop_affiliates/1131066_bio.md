**What teachers are saying…**

“I was already excited and enthusiastic to bring coding to the students at my school, but this workshop helped bring many things into better focus as to how to present the many different steps of coding to many different age levels. Thank you so much for providing me the opportunity to attend and enhance my knowledge!”

“Great workshop. Excellent materials! I’m loving the curriculum guide. We are prepared to make our elementary school a K-5 coding school! Thank you for the excellent resources!”
