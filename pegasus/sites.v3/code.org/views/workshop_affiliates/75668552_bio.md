After 20 years working in professional theater in New York City and on tour (stage manager and wardrobe) I left the “glamorous life” to become a special ed teacher - first in Brooklyn, NY and then in Minnesota.  The call of the arts was powerful and I went back to work at a professional theater in St. Paul before joining Twin Cities PBS on the Events Team. Covid saw a major change in how we attend and present events and an upswing in the need for quality educational assets so I moved into our station’s Education department.
I finally am able to merge all of my education, experience, and passion into my role working with teachers and families to promote STEM, the Arts, and PBS through engagement activities and Professional Development!
