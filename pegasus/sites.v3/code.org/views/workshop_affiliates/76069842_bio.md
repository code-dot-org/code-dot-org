I am so excited to make new connections with educators from the Northern Nevada area and connect more students with the joys of Code.org! As an educator myself, I have loved using code in my classroom and introducing my students to all the fun they can have in code while also meeting computer science standards! I have been teaching in Northern Nevada in one role or another since 2011. I have most recently been teaching fourth grade at Stead Elementary in the northern Reno area. During the 2020-2021 school year I had the opportunity to teach a distance 5th grade classroom. It was during that time I embraced code.org for my class to engage with content and to keep students interested in class when another curriculum just was not engaging enough. It turned out to be exactly what my students needed to stay involved in class and keep them looking forward to every day at school. Throughout it all I have loved teaching 4th grade most, but I am looking forward to the new experience of teaching 7th grade this coming year! No matter what grade I teach, I know that I will be including code.org in my class routines and it will be so fun to share my love of this program with others!
