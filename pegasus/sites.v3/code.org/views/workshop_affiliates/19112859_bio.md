In addition to being a facilitator for Code.org, I am also a Technology Applications teacher.  I have over 500 students who come through my computer lab every week.  I enjoy preparing them to develop computational thinking skills in preparation for learning to write code and solve other problems. Staying STEM focused (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) I truly believe that all students even as young as kindergarten, should have access to quality technology applications and computer science curriculum.  In my spare time I enjoy sporting events, fishing, movies and spending time with my family.
