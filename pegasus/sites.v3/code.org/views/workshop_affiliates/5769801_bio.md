Angelina is the AP Computer Science Principles teacher at Veteran’s Tribute Career and Technical Academy in Las Vegas, Nevada as well as the head facilitator for AP CS Principles trainings in her district. VTCTA has been her home now for five years, but she has always had a passion for technology. Angelina earned a Master’s degree in Technology in Education in 2008, and thereafter she used her skills and natural creativity to make her social studies classes a more interactive and fun experience for her learners. Having been involved with Code.org for the past four years - first with the Hour of Code, then as an Exploring Computer Science and AP CS Principles teacher - Angelina is looking forward to passing on her knowledge and skills to a whole new set of teachers, and in turn helping to shape the upcoming generation of students as they prepare for a life in a technology driven world.
