Kristin is a Technology Teacher at South Highlands Elementary School in Shreveport.  She has taught for 8 years teaching Discoveries, 4th grade, and middle school Computer Literacy and Journey to Careers. 

Prior to delving into teaching, she worked for Ernst & Young.   As a Senior Tax Consultant she utilized various tax programs and developed technology solutions using Microsoft Excel and Access. 

With years of experience in the field of technology in both education and business environments, she has decided to venture into something new...Code.org.   It is going to be quite a challenge, but she knows her school community will love it!
