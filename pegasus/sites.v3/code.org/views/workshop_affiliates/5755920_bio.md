Tom lives in Prince Frederick, MD with his wife of 11 years, Stephanie. They live in a house they had custom built on his family’s old tobacco farm, which has been in the family since a land grant from Lord Baltimore when Maryland was being settled. They have two 7-month-old kittens, Cadence and Coda, who work hard on destroying the house daily.
