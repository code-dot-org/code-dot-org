Jacqueline is a technology teacher and #edtech coach at Norway-Vulcan Area Schools, a 1:1 iPad district in Norway, Michigan. Previously she taught in a neighboring district but changed jobs in 2013 to be in a 1:1 environment. She teaches in all three buildings in her district with classes in the high school, middle school and elementary. Her minor in Computer Science has always been a passion of hers and she teaches coding in all three buildings even down to the Early Kindergarten program! She truly believes that coding should be a part of every student's curriculum in some shape or form and that it will be a very large part of our future in every single field. She is an experienced professional development instructor with experience not only in her own district but in the district in which she previously taught as well as several other districts who have hired her for services. She is beyond excited to help other teachers enjoy and understand coding in a way that enables them to share this amazing skill with students. She wants teachers to know that anybody can code and to get ready for an exciting new journey but do not fear it. Get passionate about coding with Jacqueline!
