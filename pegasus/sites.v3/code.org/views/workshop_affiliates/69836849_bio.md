## Dixie Cooper[dcooper@computersciencealliance.org](mailto: dcooper@computersciencealliance.org)My name is Dixie Cooper and I am from Albuquerque, NM.  I taught Web Development for two years at the middle school level using the code.org curriculum and have been using it ever since.  I completed a 14 week Fullstack Web Development Bootcamp through CNM as well.  I am so excited to become a facilitator and to further my knowledge of how to get coding and technology into the classroom.
