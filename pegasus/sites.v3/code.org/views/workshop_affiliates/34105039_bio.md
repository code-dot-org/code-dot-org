## Kayla  Burkel[knburkel9156@gmail.com](mailto: knburkel9156@gmail.com)I teach technology and computer science at a middle school in Colorado. My favorite thing about teaching CS is there's always something to try and new things to learn. I am always collecting new ideas to try with my students. I have two main goals as a teacher and facilitator. I want my students have a basic understanding of how technology works. I want them to be able to use technology to show what they're learning.
