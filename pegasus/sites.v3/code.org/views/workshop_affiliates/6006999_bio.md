**What teachers say about Kim's workshops**

"Our presenter, Kim, was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. She kept the workshop interesting and was very organized. Other professional workshops I have attended tend to drag on. Kim kept everyone motivated, moving, and awake. Fantastic workshop, fantastic presenter!"

"First off, Kim Monroe was an excellent facilitator - I am going to try to get some of my colleagues to her next workshop. Second, I feel like communicating with peers and kindred spirits helped give me additional inspiration for trying to push CS as a focus in our school district. This was a very helpful workshop!"
