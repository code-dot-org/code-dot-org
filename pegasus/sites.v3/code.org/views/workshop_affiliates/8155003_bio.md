I am currently a 5th grade Google Apps teacher and 6th grade science teacher at Noemi Dominguez Elementary in La Feria ISD.  I am the founder and sponsor for my campus' Science Club which competes in Science Olympiad, codes with Google CS First and Scratch, and uses TinkerCAD for 3D printing.  My latest endeavor is physical computing with Raspberry Pi.  I place a high emphasis on girls and Hispanics in STEAM.  

I’m a professional development junkie who loves to collaborate with others and share what I’ve learned. As a Google Certified Educator, I help train students, parents, and staff in various Google Apps fundamentals.  I also help provide science, technology integration, and coding workshops at the campus, district, regional, and state level.  In January 2017, I was tasked with researching, initiating, training, and implementing a district wide elementary coding program and chose Code.Org.
