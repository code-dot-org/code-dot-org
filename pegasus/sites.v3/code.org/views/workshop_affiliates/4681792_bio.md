I am in my second year of teaching Computer Science/Information Technology to high schoolers at North Iowa Community Schools in Buffalo Center, Iowa.  I also teach fifth through eighth graders computer tech exploratory for a quarter each year.  I am glad to say that I use code.org curriculum at all levels.  You can find me using CS Fundamentals with 5th and 6th graders, CS Discoveries with freshmen, and CS Principles with juniors and seniors.  I am also the K-12 Media Specialist at North Iowa.  I am a life-long learner who enjoys living on the farm with my husband and our cats!
