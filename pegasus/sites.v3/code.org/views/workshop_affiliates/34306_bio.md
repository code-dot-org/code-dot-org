Susie is the Technology teacher at Torrey Hills Elementary School in San Diego, California. She has been a frontrunner in her district ed tech dept. for the last ten years. Before teaching in the Technology Lab, Mrs. Hopper taught 6th grade for 5 years, 3rd grade for 3 years and the multi-media library for 2 years. Being a "clicky" and computer-savvy classroom teacher has opened new opportunities for the students she teaches. By seeking out new curriculum and ideas, she discovered coding for kids and quickly became excited about the possibilities  in their future. Recognized for her enthusiasm by the creators of code.org, Susie was one of the first officially trained Professional Development affiliates to be a teacher workshop facilitator in San Diego. She is excited to show you how to bring this opportunity to your classes as well.

 **What teachers say about Susie's workshops:**
"Coding is crazy cool, and not as difficult as I thought it would be. My students love it!"

"Code.org curriculum ties the math and critical thinking skills that we find in the common core into one simple online package for schools, and it's free. I really like it!"
