**What teachers are saying…**

“This was an excellent workshop. I traveled from Raleigh to Charlotte to attend, and it was well worth the trip! The instructor, Sharon was awesome, as well as the presentation and pace of the material, the cooperative learning sessions, and the format overall. I can’t wait to use the strategies learned with my kids at school, and I look forward to continuing my learning with Code.org.”

“Dr. Sharon Jones was a delightful person and facilitator and I learned so much from her experience and code.org. I highly recommend this professional development opportunity to all educators.”
