Angie began her career teaching in an English Language classroom. Her students were new to the country, with little to no English. While she enjoyed this position, her true passion is in helping people of all ages find the joy in learning. She is currently doing this through her position as a technology integrationist in a K-12 school district. She found, through workshops she provided at her school, she was able to break down what some think is complicated technology into simple steps for all to follow and implement in their classrooms.
