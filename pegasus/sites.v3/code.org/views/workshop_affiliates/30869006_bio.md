I am a CS Curriculum Specialist for the Sacramento County Office of Education.  Over the past 11 years I have spent most of my time in education as a classroom coach, K-12 for teachers in math, science and CS.  I was an adjunct professor of a course on teaching secondary science with LMU and a course on teaching elementary mathematics for Fresno Pacific University.  I was the lead author of "Preparedness Ambassadors; Disaster Preparedness for California's Fourth Graders" for the Governors Office of Emergency Services.  Currently I support the professional learning component of the NSF grant "CS4NorCal" where we research and implement methods for establishing CS pathways into rural communities.
