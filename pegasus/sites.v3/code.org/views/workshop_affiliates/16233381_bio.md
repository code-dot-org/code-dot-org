John has been an educator for more than 30 years, teaching math, science, technology and computer science in secondary ed and college settings. Currently retired from Northwestern Michigan College, he continues to teach as an adjunct professor in the CIT Department. Johnâ€™s computing interest began when he first learned to use punch cards and ticker tape to program minicomputers in the 70s. He later founded a web development company and today enjoys exploring new languages and embedded systems. John continues to stay involved in the local robotics and computer science community, while also helping to develop STEM curriculum and supporting K12 STEM educators.

John and his wife Amy can most often be found exploring on and off trail hiking, biking, kayaking, skiing and snowshoeing...and a bit of soaring in the Michigan skies.
