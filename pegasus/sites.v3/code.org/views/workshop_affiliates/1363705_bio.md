**What teachers say about Vanessa's workshops**

"This was absolutely one of the best professional development workshops that I have attended in 22+ years. The facilitator was very well prepared, and had a positive attitude toward the subject matter. She was friendly, patient, and helpful in every way. I am excited about this program."

"Vanessa was extremely knowledgeable and related well to her audience. She settled my insecurity of teaching code to my students on my campus. Thank you for providing this opportunity to me. - Sue C. from San Antonio, TX"

"I think the workshop was wonderful. I always enjoy working with Vanessa. She is very professional and well organized. The activities were fun and engaging, I didn't mind giving up my Saturday to polish my CS teaching skills. I teach technology applications but hope to be able to work more CS into my lessons. The book we received will be of great help. My students will have a great time with the UnPlugged activities, and they love the online lessons. Thanks!"
