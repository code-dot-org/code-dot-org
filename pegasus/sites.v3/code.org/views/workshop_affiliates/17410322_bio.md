## Steve Qunell[stevequnell@gmail.com](mailto: stevequnell@gmail.com)Steve teaches social studies and computer science at an alternative high school in Kalispell, Montana, just a short drive from Glacier National Park. He's been with Code.org since 2017 working with teachers and students across many grade levels. He particularly enjoys teachers who are uncertain they can teach computer science because he once believed the same about himself. Most of all, Steve enjoys engaging students in the curriculum because it teaches real-world, thinking and problem-solving skills that are often left out of traditional courses.
