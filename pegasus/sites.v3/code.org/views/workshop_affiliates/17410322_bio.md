## Steve Qunell

Steve currently teaches Social Studies and Coding at Linderman Education Center in Kalispell, Montana. Linderman is an alternative, independent high school and home to about 170 students. He has been teaching social studies and math for the past 17 years, and working with at risk students for about 10 of those years.

Steve has been teaching coding for the last 5 years in both middle and high school settings in Hawaii and Montana. In 2014, Steve won the code.org state technology grant for the state of Hawaii while he was working at Iao Intermediate school on Maui. During the Hour of Code week that year, Steve helped over 900 students and 100 parents complete several different parts of the curriculum.

Steve believes that coding is important for all students because it teaches logic and critical thinking. He believes these skills are the building blocks for higher order and complex understanding, skills that come in handy across the school curriculum and the curriculum of life in the 21st Century.
