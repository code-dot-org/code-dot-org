Kerrie Rovito teaches 4th-8th grade science at a public school in Chicago, Illinois. This will be Kerrie''s 3rd year using GUTS in her classroom, and second year as GUTS trainer and facilitator. In addition to leading workshops through Project GUTS, Kerrie has also led webinars for Chicago Public School teachers on how to best use the curriculum and access resources.

Kerrie is so excited to be bringing coding to her classroom, and has worked on implementing not only the GUTS program, but also Scratch and Code.org tutorials as well as written grants to obtain funding for Lego Mindstorm and Dot and Dash robots.
