Hi! I am happy to be your facilitator. I have experience coaching teachers in grades K-12 in my STEM efforts in districts. I have taught mathematics and computer science for 10+ years in grades 7-12. Computer Science is my passion, and I spread this passion by facilitating teacher training across my state of Alabama. I was part of the AP Computer Science Principles national launch in 2017. I hope to instill a love of computer science learning in you.
