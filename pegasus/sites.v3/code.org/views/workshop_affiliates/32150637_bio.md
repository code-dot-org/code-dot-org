## Sean Glantz[sglantz@djusd.net](mailto: sglantz@djusd.net)I am beginning my 7th year teaching at Da Vinci Charter Academy, a 7-12 PBL public charter school in Davis, California. This year I am teaching four CS courses: Project Invent (Capstone), AP Computer Science Principles (Code.org), CS1 (CMU CS Academy), and Computer Science Discoveries (Code.org).

I am a PBL instructional coach and co-leader of the CSTA Sacramento Chapter. I recently launched a new CTE ICT Software and Systems Development pathway in the Davis Joint Unified School District with a focus on equity and community impact. I am also an advisor for our school's CS Honor Society chapter. I have presented on agile project management for CSTA, Summer of CS, CalTEACH, the Computer Science Alliance, and educators within DJUSD.

Outside of teaching, I enjoy snowboarding, camping, traveling, and food. Before becoming an educator, I gained industry experience working in GIS for the US Forest Service.
