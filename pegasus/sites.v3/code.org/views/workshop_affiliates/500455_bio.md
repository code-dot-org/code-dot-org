## Elizabeth Davis[edavis@wadsworthschools.org](mailto: edavis@wadsworthschools.org)I teach 7th grade technology in Wadsworth, Ohio. This is my 17th year teaching. I  taught language arts and social studies up until about 5 years ago when I was asked to lead a newly minted "computer" class. I had no clue what to teach and no one really cared what curriculum I chose so long as it was technology. I wasn't in that position long before I found the students and I both needed something more. Some online searching led me to Code.org and the Computer Science Discoveries program. I have been a Code.org facilitator and forum moderator for the last few years. I truly enjoy the work that I do both with students and adults. Code.org has allowed me to offer new opportunities in thinking and problem solving for my students while also offering me the opportunity to branch out in working with adults. Facilitating for Code has filled some of the gaps in my own learning. I thoroughly enjoy opening up the curriculum for other adults to feel the same.
