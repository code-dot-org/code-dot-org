Hi! My name is Mrs. Bymers and I have taught 4th and 5th Grade in Reno, Nevada for the past 10 years! I grew up in the Reno area and went to UNR for my teaching degree. I love teaching Social Studies, whether it’s about Nevada or the United States! I am passionate about students trying new things and pushing their boundaries. If they love it, GREAT! If not, at least you tried and now we know. I have had 1-to-1 technology in my classroom for the past 5 years which has significantly enhanced our productivity, engagement, and ability to be creative through electronic platforms. One of my favorite teacher memories was when I was selected to travel to Alexandria, Virginia to stay at Mount Vernon (George Washington’s estate) for a week where we got private tours, lunch in his dining room, and boat rides up the Potomac. One day I hope to become an elementary school principal, but I love the classroom too much to leave right now. Let’s have a great year!
