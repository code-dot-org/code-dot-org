Brian started teaching in Chicago Public Schools, but has recently moved to Louisville. His background is in math, but can remember programming “Guess the Number” games on his TI-81 back in high school. Brian was first introduced to Code.org back in Chicago when his school participated in the Hour of Code, and he has been hooked ever since. He’s excited to be part of a program that he feels so strongly about."
