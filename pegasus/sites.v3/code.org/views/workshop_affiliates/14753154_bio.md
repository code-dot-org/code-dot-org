Yvonne is passionate about creating positive learning environments. Her philosophy on using technology in education is simple: Empower educators; Engage students. She teaches computer science for grades 6-12 and facilitates professional development workshops that model challenging yet productive learning opportunities using neuroscience evidence-based strategies. She is developing an online CS curriculum and community outreach program for her K-12 independent school, the Adelson Educational Campus, which emphasizes computational thinking and applied “Making” strategies. Supporting fellow educators has always been important to her. As a graduate student at Cornell University she developed workshops for teaching assistants, and later as a faculty member at Pomona College she collaboratively designed websites and wrote blogs about online teaching and research tools. More recently, a NSF grant allowed her to collaboratively research, design, and create resources for teaching climate change risks, and she extended K-12 participation opportunities as Co-Lead for the 2016 Las Vegas Mini-Maker Faire.
