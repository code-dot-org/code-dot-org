In addition to being a facilitator for Code.org, Lisa is a first grade teacher. Lisa aims to encourage creative use of technology in the classroom rather than simple consumption. She is a leader in building meaningful learning experiences for all students at her school, and has accomplished this through the creation of a school-wide STEM cart, as well as incorporating Code.org in the classroom. Lisa has provided training to other teachers in creative technology use in the classroom, as well as traditional games. Lisa continues to find new resources to help her students reach their maximum potential, and supports other teachers to accomplish the same goal for their students.
