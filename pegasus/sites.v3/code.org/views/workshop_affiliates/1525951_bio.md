**What teachers are saying…**

“I love, love, LOVED the professional development. It was the best PD I’ve ever attended. I went into it a little apprehensive about learning about coding but I left feeling empowered to begin this program with my students (and continuing the program for myself)”

“The best workshop I have been to in a long time. I am excited about teaching coding and interested in learning more programming.”
