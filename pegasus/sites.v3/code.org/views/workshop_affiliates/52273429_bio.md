Michelle teaches computer science at the middle school level in Grand Junction Colorado. She has a bachelor’s degree in biology and a master’s degree in elementary education. While being a MESA advisor for an after school program she received an endorsement to become highly qualified in STEM Career and Technical Education (CTE), which opened the doors to teaching computer science. With no prior computer science experience, Michelle has learned first hand through the code.org platform the concepts and skills involved in computer science. She never imagined she would be a computer science teacher with a background in biology. She believes her experience has been a good example for her students as it demonstrates the unexpected opportunities that can arise in life.
