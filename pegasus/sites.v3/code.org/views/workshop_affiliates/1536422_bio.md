Rebecca has facilitated science and technology professional development for over 15 years in Broward County, Florida, the 6th largest school district in the nation. She has a masters degree in Instructional Technology and Elementary Education and enjoys interacting with fellow educators from all over the country. She loves the idea of bringing computer science to elementary schools and seeing the excitement of teachers coding for the first time. Her motto is, “If it’s fun, then do it—and computer science is fun!

**What teachers say about Rebecca's workshops**

“One of my most enjoyable workshops! I loved all the hands on activities and getting to use the program myself, rather than just listening to the instructor speak about it."  

"This should be a mandatory class for all teachers. A very good beginning for getting students interested in computer sciences."

"This was awesome! So much fun. I can definitely see how the kids would be addicted to coding. I couldn't tear myself away from the games, although the unplugged activities were great as well.”
