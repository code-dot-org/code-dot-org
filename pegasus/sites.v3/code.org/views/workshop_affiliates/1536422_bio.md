Rebecca has facilitated science and technology professional development for 15 years in Broward County, Florida, the 6th largest school district in the nation. She has a masters degree in Instructional Technology and Elementary Education and enjoys interacting with fellow educators from all over the country. She loves the idea of bringing computer science to elementary schools and seeing the excitement of teachers coding for the first time. Her motto is, “If it’s fun, then do it—and computer science is fun!”

**What teachers are saying…**

“Awesome collaboration with fellow educators and the facilitators performed their duties well! Most enjoyable Professional Development in a very long time!”
