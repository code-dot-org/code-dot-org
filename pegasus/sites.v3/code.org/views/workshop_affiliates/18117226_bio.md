Sara is a mother of three very active children, living on the family ranch in Western Nebraska with my husband. 
In 2009, she graduated from the University of Wyoming with her Bachelor of Arts in Elementary Education. Graduated from Chadron State College with a Masters in Curriculum and Instruction in 2018. After teaching 9 years in K-2, she started teaching computer science as the district's K-6 CS specialist. She completed her K-8 computer science education endorsement in 2020 from Northwestern College Iowa.
Sara's CS journey started with code.org fundamentals and her 1st grade class to introduce problem solving. After seeing their growth in computational thinking, she applied for the district's K-6 CS educator position to bring CS to all PreK-6 grade students in the district. Through code.org she has been trained in CSF (including Deep Dive), CSD, and CSP.
