Herman Nelson is an instructional technology coach in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. He teaches K-6 after-school computer classes, co-owns a web development company, has a M.S. degree in Computer Information Systems and is enrolled in a Computer Science degree program at Austin Peay State University.

His interest in coding began in 2001 when he took his first HTML class and began designing websites for schools in his area. He believes that coding is an effective strategy for teachers to use in their classrooms because it is not only fun, but it encourages collaboration, problem solving, and helps prepare students for the growing computer science job field.

Herman believes computer science instruction should start in the early elementary grades and has spent over 27 years working with students in grades K-6.
