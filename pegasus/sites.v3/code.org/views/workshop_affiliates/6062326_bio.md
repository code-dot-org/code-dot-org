Herman Nelson is a 6th grade teacher at Overall Creek Elementary School in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. He teaches K-6 after-school computer classes, co-owns a web development company, has a M.S. degree in Computer Information Systems and is enrolled in a Computer Science degree program at Middle Tennessee State University.

His interest in coding began in 2001 when he took his first HTML class and began designing websites for schools in his area. He believes that coding is an effective strategy for teachers to use in their classrooms because not only is it fun, but it encourages collaboration, problem solving, and helps prepare students for the growing computer science job field.

Herman believes computer science instruction should start in the early elementary grades and has spent over 26 years working with students in grades K-6.
