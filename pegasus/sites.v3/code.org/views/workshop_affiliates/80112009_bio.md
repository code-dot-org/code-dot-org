## Brian Yeager[briyeager@gmail.com](mailto: briyeager@gmail.com)Brian teaches computer science at the middle school level in Bel Air, Maryland. He has used Code.org's Computer Science Discoveries (CSD) curriculum since transitioning from teaching high school in 2018. He has found the CSD curriculum to be the best he has worked with in his 17+ years of teaching. Prior to teaching middle school, Brian taught AP Computer Science Principles, Business, Computer Applications and Technology at the high school level. Having the opportunity to use code.org's CSD curriculum has enabled Brian to not only help improve his students’ problem-solving abilities, but also has provided him a platform to foster his student’s persistence and to celebrate their collaborative, creative solutions to problems. In addition to teaching computer science, Brian is also the advisor to his school’s coding club where students engage in Hour of Code activities and work together to find ways computational thinking can help improve the school community.
