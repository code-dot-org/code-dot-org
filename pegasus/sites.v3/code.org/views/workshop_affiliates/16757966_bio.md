Efren taught for 25 in the Rio Grande Valley (South Texas). He attended UT-Pan American and received a B.S. in Chemistry with a minor in Computer Science. He taught IPC, Physics, Computer Science and all levels of Chemistry. Efren had worked at Weslaco H.S., STISD Science Academy, Region One (as a Science Specialist mostly Chem and Tech), Port Isabel H.S. and at South Texas ISD Medical Professions.
Efren hadn’t used any of his CS knowledge until he attended a Picademy about 5 years ago. He remembered how much he enjoyed CS and how students should be exposed to it. After the Picademy, Efren convinced his H.S. principal to start offering CS since it wasn’t available. He got “stuck” teaching it but was happy to do it.
Efren is always looking for new ways of using technology in the classroom and ways to collaborate/help others. Efren thinks Code.org can really help teachers get into teaching computer science. It’s extremely helpful since it provides all the resources a beginning teacher would need.
