**What teachers say about Lisa's workshops**

"This was a great professional development experience and one that I am glad to have attended on a Saturday. Great group of participants and an excellent presenter. Lisa Anthony made coding feel accessible and ready to bring to the classroom. Helpful. Thank you."

"This was a cool workshop and good use of my time. I like how we learned the pedagogy, but it also highlighted principles of equity. This is a big reason why I'll be teaching code in an Oakland public school, so it was cool that there are resources surrounding these topics."

"Great way to kick start my entry into the classroom with these lessons. I was able to set up my class and learn how I could monitor their progress. I also had enough time to use the lessons that they'd be using to see where my students may need assistance when it's their turn."
