Cecilia teaches computer science and computer application classes at the middle school level in Southern California. She loves using code.org curriculum with these classes. She had the opportunity to pilot two units of Computer Science Discoveries. She learned the curriculum first hand and watched the development of Computer Science Discoveries since its release. She received her bachelorâ€™s in computer science a long time ago and never imagined it would be so relevant in her teaching career today.
