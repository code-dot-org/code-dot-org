Casey is currently a math teacher at Benjamin Stoddert Middle School in Charles County, Maryland.  She majored in education in college, and minored in computer science at the College of Saint Rose.  Her interest in computer programming led her to becoming the Code.org math representative at her school, and now a training facilitator for CS in Algebra for 2 years.

Casey has loved working with teachers around the country to teach them this worthwhile program to promote #CSforAll!
