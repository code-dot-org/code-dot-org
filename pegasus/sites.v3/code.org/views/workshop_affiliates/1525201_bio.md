Keith is a math and computer science teacher at Oak Ridge High School in Oakridge, Tennessee where he teaches Introduction to Programming and AP Computer Science. He is very passionate about growing the number of students studying computer science, especially among females and minorities. He believes the best way to do this is to start early. In 2013, Keith received the National Center for Women and Informational Technology’s Aspirations in Computing Educator Award for his work to grow the number of girls studying computer science. He spends his spare time with his wife Jenney and two sons Kaleb and Luke, and goes to the golf course as much as possible.

**About Keith**

“Keith was a wonderful facilitator. We had a wide range of participants that it was fun to meet. We enjoyed ourselves all day long with the activities and the discussion (and the lunch).” - Suzanne C. from Maryville, TN

“This was a great workshop and totally worth the 3 hr drive!” - Lisa G. from Murfreesboro, TN

“The workshop was an excellent experience. I now feel more confident in planning for our upcoming summer computer coding camp. We will be using the Code.org curriculum including the unplugged activities. The code bag with code items was a thoughtful touch!” - Kim H. from Clinton, TN
