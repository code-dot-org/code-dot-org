## Blanca Gonzales[blancazgonzales@gmail.com](mailto: blancazgonzales@gmail.com)Blanca has a degree in Biology and a minor in Psychology from the University of Texas at Dallas. She started teaching middle school science soon after graduation until she came across Code.org one day. Computer science had always been something that she wanted to learn but like many people thought it wasnâ€™t something she could do. Code.org changed her mind. After signing up and trying out CS Discoveries she realized that CS is truly something anyone can learn. Now she is going into her 4th year teaching CS. She teaches 7th grade Intro. to Programming, 8th grade Fundamentals of CS and facilitates an all girls computer science club at a Title I school that has a 98% minority student demographic. CS has been so successful at her school that her club went on to win the Congressional App Challenge for her district in 2019! She believes that this level of success is achievable at all schools and is ready to help you every step of the way.
