## Alise Braick

I am in my fifteenth year teaching mathematics at Middle School IS 392 in Brooklyn and my third year teaching computer science to middle school students. I  hold a Bachelor in Civil Engineering and a Master in Middle School Math Education and Instructional Technology. For the past three years, I have led the “Computer Science for All “ initiative at my school and have sought every opportunity to improve my computer science content knowledge and pedagogy.  Through the CS4AllNYC,  I have received rigorous training in game and web design, physical computing, and Javascript. I am super passionate about the integration of computer science with mathematics, which has brought excitement surrounding computational thinking and sparked my students’ interest to dive deeper into mathematics. I have been awarded the MƒA (Math for America) Master Teacher Fellowship, and I am proud to be a part of an immutable community of educators that strives to continued growth and professional development. I love attending conferences and networking with fellow educators, and I have presented at various regional conferences focusing on instructional technology tools and the integration of computer science across subject areas.
