The 2019-20 school year is her 8th year of teaching and she previously worked in the private sector.  Over the years, she has taught a variety of classes to students in 9-12th grades.  She has taught Business Publishing, Intro to Business, Business Applications, Applied Technologies, College Computers, Multimedia, and many others.  Hajdi enjoys learning new technologies and trying new things in the classroom to keep her content and instruction relevant.  She taught the CS Discoveries course last school year and plans on continuing to further her implementation into the middle school curriculum.  In the summer of 2019, Hajdi completed a STEM Externship with Webspec Design to further her understanding of the web development, marketing, and web design industry.  She hopes that her experience along with the Code.org curriculum will help students see the potential and relevance of careers in the computer science field.
