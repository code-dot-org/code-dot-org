Geoff recently completed his tenth year in education and currently teaches Computer Science and technology Pre-K through Grade 6 at two rural elementary schools in central Maine. After studying to become a high school social studies teacher, he "accidentally" got started in education working as a technology integrator at four elementary schools, and hasn't looked back since. Geoff's primary interests as a computer science teacher are closing the gender gap in tech and investigating the intersections of computer science and content across the curriculum. Recently, he also helped establish a CSforAll committee in his district and is serving on the curriculum and partners subcommittees. Geoff is a FIRST LEGO League robotics coach and instructor, an active member of CSTA Maine, and a graduate student at the University of Maryland Baltimore County. In his spare time he enjoys reading, video games, spending time with friends, and live sports. Geoff uses he/him pronouns.
