**What teachers are saying…**

“The facilitator, Debra, is very enthusiastic about computer science, so she made the workshop very fun. It was also great to hear her thoughts on on useful sites, gadgets, etc. always good to meet other teachers and share ideas.”

“This was a fantastic workshop. I learned a lot and now feel comfortable teaching this to my class of kindergartners. I still have a lot to learn. I’m going to teach my 73 year old father this as well. Thank you!!!”
