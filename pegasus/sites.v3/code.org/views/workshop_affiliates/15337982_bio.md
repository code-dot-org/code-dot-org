"Eve is Computer Science Department Chair at Ursuline Academy of Dallas.  Many students enter her classroom not knowing what computer science is all about, but by the end of the year, Eve's hope is that every student has had an opportunity to be successful at programming and perhaps find a new passion. Eve received Bachelor of Science degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics from Southern Methodist University.  After graduating, she worked as a software engineer for E-Systems, Inc.  Although she enjoyed the challenges of developing state-of-the-art software, her work with children convinced Eve to follow her passion for teaching.  Ursuline Academy offered Eve the opportunity share her love of programming and inspire high school girls.   Eve is excited to help prepare other teachers to introduce the world of computer science to students."
