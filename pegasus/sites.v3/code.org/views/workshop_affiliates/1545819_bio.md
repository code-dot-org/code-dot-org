**What teachers are saying…**

“Waking up at the crack of dawn, driving to another town and giving up an entire Saturday was so worth it! Margaret gave me a good understanding of how to use Code.org with learners and facilitated lively, deep conversations around computer programming and all that comes with it including purpose, rationale and equity. The time passed quickly and I left ready to not only begin working with my learners, but also ready to share what I learned with colleagues.”
