Designed for 9 - 12 grade students, CS Principles introduces students to the foundational concepts of computer science and challenges them to explore how computing and technology can impact the world. This year-long course can be taught as an introductory course and as an AP course - no prerequisites required for students or teachers new to computer science! CS Principles complements CS Discoveries with a deeper focus on concepts such as how the internet works and the societal impacts of computer science.
