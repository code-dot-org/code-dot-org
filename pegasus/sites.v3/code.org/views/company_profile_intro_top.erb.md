## Join <%= @company['display_name_s'] %> during Hour of Code and support the next generation in learning computer science.

Computer science is the defining field of the 21st century, yet most of us never learn it, and most schools don't even offer it. In support of our children's education and our future, we are asking you to try an Hour of Code. Even if you already know computer science, you can try the modern tutorials, and help others learn.

Give it a shot. This is a tutorial that even 8-year-olds can do, and it's fun. Let's see how close we can get to 100% participation!

When you're done, we hope you can support the Hour of Code in one of the many ways listed below.
