# About Us

Code.org is a non-profit dedicated to expanding participation in computer science education by making it available in more schools, and increasing participation by women and underrepresented students of color. Our vision is that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer programming. We believe computer science should be part of the core curriculum in education, alongside other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses, such as biology, physics, chemistry and algebra.

## Albanian Hour of Code
With the Albanian Hour of Code, Code.org aims to help demystify that coding is difficult and enable parents, teachers and students across the nation get a fun introduction to coding. The Albanian Hour of Code team is organized by Almooc.
