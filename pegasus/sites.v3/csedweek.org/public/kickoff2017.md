# CSEdWeek Kickoff Event

## December 4, 2017 - Palo Alto, CA

## **Save the Date**

Each year, we have kicked off Computer Science Education Week with a signature event&mdash;at the White House, opening the stock market, or with Canada's prime minister. This year, the week's official kick off will be in Silicon Valley.

We invite you to a special event to launch Computer Science Education Week 2017, to celebrate the accomplishments of the CS education community, and to make new announcements and pledges to K-12 computer science with a special focus on diversity.

### Featuring special guests:

## **A Celebration of Diversity**

At this year's kickoff event we are celebrating diversity in computer science. This year, we’ve seen a groundswell of parents, students, teachers, school districts, states, and even entire countries expanding access to high-quality K-12 computer science for all students. This computer science movement has made some great strides in increasing diversity! For example, the number of female students and underrepresented minorities taking an AP computer science course doubled in 2017 from the last school year. On Code.org's platform alone, of the 19 million students learning computer science, 45 percent are female and 48 percent are underrepresented minorities. While things are moving in the right direction, we have a long way to go. We need to continue to promote professional development for teachers that includes both training on equity and access and tools to recruit and retain a diverse CS student population. We need to continue reaching out to students of all backgrounds where they are — at their skill-level, in their schools, and in ways that inspire them to keep learning. This is how we continue to increase diversity in computer science.

## **Pledges and Announcements**

Would you like to help generate positive press for the work your organization is doing to support computer science? We are now [collecting pledges and announcements](https://bit.ly/csedweek2017form) for the CSEdWeek kickoff event. We want to share the spotlight and press attention with you during this event by inviting you to submit a new announcement and/or pledge with a focus on broadening participation in computer science. 

These announcements represent an opportunity to celebrate a recent achievement or the launch of a new initiative. Pledges represent a clear and measurable goal to expand access and diversity in computer science that includes a specific number of teachers, schools, and/or students who will be engaged. Announcements and pledges should be **new** and newsworthy. We won’t repeat information that has been previously shared publicly. Of course, you're welcome to schedule independent announcements for the morning of December 4th as well.

[Please complete this form](https://bit.ly/csedweek2017form) by **November 13th** to submit an announcement and/or pledge to be considered for the 2017 CSEdWeek kickoff event. See examples of [pledges and announcements here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YzicRgPnuJzkzxqF06v2NZsXdmZNxSYAKmclRPShf9M).

Thank you for your support of computer science education. Have questions? Contact jake.bell@code.org.

## **National Awards**

Teachers and students have been at the heart of the amazing growth in computer science education, and we will be shining a light on those achievements! Tell us about what you, your student, your school, and/or your district have accomplished this past year for the opportunity to be recognized at the kickoff event for CSEdWeek!

Example achievements:

- A teacher doubled the number of students in a computer science program and increased the percentage of females and underrepresented minorities.
- A student created an app that helps people in their community.
- A school held a special Computer Science showcase for all students and their families.
- A district made computer science mandatory for all incoming freshmen.
- A new after-school club for elementary school students was created, and those students placed first in a regional competition.

Those selected will be awarded a trip to Palo Alto, CA to be recognized on stage at the kickoff of CSEdWeek. The awards event is a collaboration between the CSTA and Code.org. Selected students must be accompanied by a parent or guardian. This opportunity is only available for US submissions.

The nomination period opens October 2, 2017, and closes October 20, 2017, at 11:59 pm PT. Selections will be announced at the end of October. To be eligible, teachers must be employed at a K-12/pre-university school.

Nominate a student, your school, yourself, a fellow teacher/administrator/counselor, an organization, or after-school club, etc…the point is to celebrate computer science!
