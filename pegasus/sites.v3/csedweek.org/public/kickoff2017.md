# CSEdWeek Kickoff Event

## December 4, 2017 - Palo Alto, CA

## **Save the Date**

Each year, Code.org has kicked off Computer Science Education Week with a signature event&mdash;at the White House, opening the stock market, or with Canada's prime minister. This year, the week's official kick off will be in Silicon Valley.

We invite you to a special event to launch Computer Science Education Week 2017, to celebrate the accomplishments of the CS education community, and to make new announcements and pledges to K-12 computer science with a special focus on diversity.

### Featuring special guests:

## **Pledges and Announcements**

Would you like to help generate positive press for the work your organization is doing to support computer science? We are now [collecting pledges and announcements](https://bit.ly/csedweek2017form) for the CSEdWeek kickoff event. We want to share the spotlight and press attention with you during this event by inviting you to submit a new announcement and/or pledge with a focus on broadening participation in computer science. 

These announcements represent an opportunity to celebrate a recent achievement or the launch of a new initiative. Pledges represent a clear and measurable goal to expand access and diversity in computer science that includes a specific number of teachers, schools, and/or students who will be engaged. Announcements and pledges should be **new** and newsworthy. We wonâ€™t repeat information that has been previously shared publicly. Of course, you're welcome to schedule independent announcements for the morning of December 4th as well.

[Please complete this form](https://bit.ly/csedweek2017form) by **November 13th** to submit an announcement and/or pledge to be considered for the 2017 CSEdWeek kickoff event. See examples of [pledges and announcements here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YzicRgPnuJzkzxqF06v2NZsXdmZNxSYAKmclRPShf9M).

Thank you for your support of computer science education. Have questions? Contact jake.bell@code.org.

## **National Awards**

Teachers and students have been at the heart of the amazing growth in computer science education, and we will be shining a light on those achievements! In partnership with the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA), we will be selecting outstanding students, teachers, schools, and districts to receive awards for their accomplishments.
