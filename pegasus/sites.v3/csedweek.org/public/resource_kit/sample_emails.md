**Subject:** The Hour of Code is coming

Hello,

Most of us have a vague idea that a knowledge of computer science will help you get a job, but the actual numbers are pretty shocking:

- New programming jobs are growing 3 times faster than the number of students entering the field.
- More than 50 percent of all math and science jobs are for computer scientists.
- Computer science jobs are the highest-paying jobs for new graduates.

Software powers our economy, but, less than 2.4 percent of college students graduate with a CS degree. That means there aren’t going to be enough graduates to fill the jobs. To make matters worse, 95 percent of our schools don’t teach programming.

Fortunately, there’s something we can do about it. This December, we’re going to give students their first taste of coding by participating in a national hour of computer science instruction called the Hour of Code. The hour is part of Computer Science Education Week (Dec. 8-14), and our goal is to get kids to think, create, and have a blast -- all while learning some computer programming.

Students (and adults) across the country are getting involved and I’d like you to join as well. Here’s how you can help:

Get the word out. Report the event, blog, tweet, send emails, tell your friends.
Give an hour to mentor students during the Hour of Code.
Bring the Hour of Code to your company or organization. The event is not just for children and we can all benefit from knowing more about how software works.
Take the Hour of Code yourself. It will be fun -- like playing a game or solving a puzzle.

**Subject:** Bringing Hour of Code to [Name of School]

Dear Principal [Name],

There’s a national education event taking place this December I wanted to let you know about. It’s called the Hour of Code, and the goal is to give more than 10 million students from across the US their first taste of computer programming.

The event is free, the prep work is minimal, and the curriculum has already been prepared -- there are a number of options, including a series of online tutorials and some “unplugged” options for classrooms without access to computers.

Beyond that, there are some really important reasons why I think we should host the Hour of Code here at [Name of School]:

- Computing jobs are growing 3 times faster than the number of computer science graduates.
- More than 50 percent of all math and science jobs are for computer scientists.
- Computer science jobs are the highest-paying jobs for new graduates.
- Computational thinking is important across all subjects.
- Only [X]% of our students are currently studying computer programming.

Plus, it’s going to be a lot of fun.

The Hour of Code is part of Computer Science Education Week (Dec. 8-14) -- timed to coincide with the birthday of the computer pioneer Admiral Grace Murray Hopper -- and is sponsored by Code.org.

Schools across the country are getting on board. How about us?

You can learn more at the Computer Science Education Week site ([csedweek.org](http://csedweek.org/)).

Thanks!

Dear [NAME],

I’m writing to ask your support in helping kids at [SCHOOL NAME] start to take charge of the wired world at our Hour of Code event in December.

Sponsored by Code.org, the Hour of Code is a first step in addressing the need for computer science education in the nation’s schools. The event is part of Computer Science Education Week and aims to give students their first taste of coding via a series of engaging tutorials.

Most of us have a vague idea that a knowledge of computer science will help you get a job, but the actual numbers are pretty shocking:

Software powers our economy, but, less than 2.4 percent of college students graduate with a CS degree. That means there aren’t going to be enough graduates to fill the jobs. To make matters worse, 95 percent of our schools don’t teach programming.

That’s what we’re looking to change.

To that end, we’re respectfully requesting donations of time (1 hour of in-class mentoring during the Hour of Code), computer hardware [SPECIFY TYPE], or donations of prizes [EXAMPLES] to further our Hour of Code efforts. We’d love your help.

Thank you for considering this request. If you have any questions, please contact me at [EMAIL] or [PHONE]. I will follow up with you shortly.

Sincerely,

[NAME]

## Sample letter to parents

Dear Parents,

We live in a world surrounded by technology. And we know that whatever field our students choose to go into as adults, their ability to succeed will increasingly hinge on understanding how technology works. But only a tiny fraction of us are learning computer science, and fewer students are studying it than a decade ago.

That’s why our entire school joined in on the largest education event in history: The Hour of Code. During Computer Science Education Week (Dec. 8-14), every one of our students will be amongst over 2 million worldwide spending one hour learning the basics.

Our Hour of Code is a statement that [SCHOOL NAME] is ready to teach these foundational 21st century skills. To continue bringing programming activities to your students, we want to make our Hour of Code event huge. I encourage you to reach out to local media, share the news on your social media channels and consider hosting additional Hour of Code events in your outside of school, in the community. 

This is a chance to change the future of education in [TOWN/CITY NAME].

See http://hourofcode.org for details, and please help us spread the word.

Sincerely,

Your principal

**Subject line:** Local school joins millions in teaching computer science for the first time

90 percent of American schools don’t teach computer science. Fewer students are learning how computers work than a decade ago. Girls and minorities are severely underrepresented. And yet, technology is increasingly shaping almost every aspect of how we live our lives. 

That’s why every one of the 478 students at Washington Elementary School are joining in on the largest education event in history: The Hour of Code. During Computer Science Education Week (Dec. 8-14), every student from kindergarten through 5th grade will spend one hour learning computer science, doing online tutorials featuring Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and Angry Birds. 

We are writing to invite you to attend our kickoff assembly, and to see kids start the activity on Monday, Dec. 8. 

The Hour of Code is a campaign to prove that regardless of age, race or gender, anyone can learn how to not just consume, but build the technologies of the future.

Our students are among over 2 million already planning to try one Hour of Code during Dec. 9-15 worldwide. This movement, organized by Code.org and supported by Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Boys & Girls Clubs of America, and over 100 others, is a statement that today’s generation of students are ready to learn critical skills for 21st century success.

**Contact:** Carol Parks, Principal, cell: (212) 555-5555

**When:** Dec. 8-14, during Computer Science Education Week. Our kickoff assembly is on Monday, Dec. 8 at 1 p.m.

**Where:** Washington Elementary School, 839 W. 112th Street, New York, NY 10030

I look forward to being in touch.

## Sample letter to politicians


Dear [Mayor/Governor/Representative/Senator LAST NAME]:


Did you know that in today’s economy, there are three good, high-paying jobs waiting for every person who graduates from college with a degree in computer science?  And, computer science is important to every industry and professional pursuit.  The discipline is foundational for all students today. Yet 90% of schools don’t teach it, and fewer kids learn to program than 10 years ago. At [SCHOOL NAME], we are trying to change that. 

Our entire school has joined in on the largest education event in history: The Hour of Code. During Computer Science Education Week (Dec. 8-14), every one of our students will be amongst over 2 million worldwide who will spend one hour learning computer science.

We’re writing to invite you to take part in our Hour of Code event and speak at our kickoff assembly. It’ll take place on [DATE, TIME, PLACE], and will make a strong statement that [State or City name] is ready to teach our students critical 21st century skills.  We want to ensure that our students are on the forefront of creating technology of the future--not just consuming it.

If you have any questions, please contact me at [PHONE NUMBER OR EMAIL ADDRESS]. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,
[NAME], [TITLE]
