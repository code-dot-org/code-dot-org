## How can you promote computer science during CS Ed Week 2015?

## 1) Host an event
Sample events

- Don't limit yourself to student-guided coding games. See the new [teacher-guided lessons plans](http://code.org/educate/teacher-led) for the Hour of Code.
- [Recruit your entire school](http://hourofcode.org) to participate in Hour of Code. 
- [Organize a school assembly](https://hourofcode.com/us/how-to/events) to introduce and promote it.
- Ask students from your existing CS classes to volunteer to help bring Hour of Code to other classrooms.
- Define your own creative Hour of Code activity - whether it involves showcasing your students' work, involving students to reach out to the rest of the school, or unplugged exercises that are more inclusive.
- Use our promotional materials: [handout](https://hourofcode.com/us/promote/resources) you can give to the principal. [Celebrity posters](https://hourofcode.com/us/promote/resources#posters) to hang on the walls. [Videos](https://code.org/educate/inspire) to play in a school assembly. See the full [Hour of Code participation kit for schools](https://hourofcode.com/us/how-to/events).
- If you organize a big school-wide event, make sure to [submit it as an organizer](http://hourofcode.com), so we can highlight it on our events page and social media channels.

## 2) Host other CS Ed Week events (instead of, or in addition to the Hour of Code)

- Make sure to see NCWIT's [10 ways to recruit girls to CS](https://www.ncwit.org/resources/top-10-ways-recruiting-high-school-women-your-computing-classes/top-10-ways-recruiting) for ideas on activities to grow participation by women
- Do an open house of your course offerings for parents, explain how CS connects to 21st century jobs.
- Pitch CS education to your local school board, superintendent, or principal. Start with [these PowerPoint slides](/files/CS-pitch-basic-stats.pptx), [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwLXrN0Yguk&feature=c4-overview-vl&list=PLzdnOPI1iJNe1WmdkMG-Ca8cLQpdEAL7Q), or [these talking points](http://www.ncwit.org/resources/moving-beyond-computer-literacy-why-schools-should-teach-computer-science)
- Go meet with your middle school to show the course offerings and importance of CS education to them (start with [one of these videos](https://code.org/educate/inspire).
- Reach out to your local four year CS department chair about having your students visit a university.
- Reach out to your local chamber of commerce to have students visit a local employer that depends on computing professionals.


## 3) Recruit broader support for Computer Science

- See our [checklist of activities](http://hourofcode.com/thanks) and ways people can recruit their employers, local politicians, etc to support the Hour of Code campaign and to get involved with computer science.
- Ask your local Congressman to support expanding access to computer science in public schools

## 4) Recruit other groups in your community

- Any group can host an Hour of Code, whether it is a church, boy scouts, local university, library, YMCA, veterans association, or labor union. If you have connections to any such organizations, reach out to them, send them a [participation guide](https://hourofcode.com/us/promote/resources), and encourage them to visit <http://csedweek.org> and participate.
