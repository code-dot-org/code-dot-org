# Participation Kit - for Computer Science Teachers

Need help organizing an event to celebrate Computer Science Education Week? Check out our tips below.

NOTE: Computer science can be celebrated throughout the year, not just in December. Highlight activities whenever it’s convenient for you, your students, and your school!

## How can you promote computer science during CS Ed Week?

### 1) Host an event

- Don't limit yourself to student-guided coding games. Check out [teacher-guided lesson plans](https://csedweek.org/learn?activity_type=lesson-plan) for the Hour of Code, and explore [all tutorials](/learn) to find more advanced challenges!
- Recruit your entire school to participate in the Hour of Code using [these handouts and sample emails](https://hourofcode.com/promote/resources). Or [organize a school assembly](https://hourofcode.com/how-to/events) to introduce and promote the Hour of Code.
- Help computer science students organize an Hour of Code with other classrooms &mdash; spread Hour of Code through a whole school!
- Hang our [celebrity posters](https://hourofcode.com/promote/resources#posters) on your classroom's walls.
- Play a [video](https://code.org/educate/inspire) in a school assembly. 
- See the full [Hour of Code participation kit for schools](https://hourofcode.com/how-to/events).
- If you organize a big school-wide event, make sure to [submit it as an organizer](https://hourofcode.com), so we can highlight it on our events page and social media channels.

### 2) Host other CS Ed Week events (instead of, or in addition to, the Hour of Code)

- Make sure to see NCWIT's [10 ways to recruit girls to CS](https://www.ncwit.org/resources/top-10-ways-recruiting-high-school-women-your-computing-classes/top-10-ways-recruiting) for ideas on activities to grow participation by women.
- Do an open house of your course offerings for parents and explain how CS connects to 21st century jobs.
- Pitch CS education to your local school board, superintendent, or principal. Start with [these PowerPoint slides](/files/computer_science_advocacy.pptx), [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwLXrN0Yguk&feature=c4-overview-vl&list=PLzdnOPI1iJNe1WmdkMG-Ca8cLQpdEAL7Q), or [these talking points](https://www.ncwit.org/resources/moving-beyond-computer-literacy-why-schools-should-teach-computer-science).
- Reach out to your local four year college's CS department chair about having your students visit the campus.
- Reach out to your local chamber of commerce to have students visit a local employer that depends on computing professionals.

### 3) Recruit broader support for Computer Science

- Send [one of these sample emails](https://hourofcode.com/promote/resources#sample-emails) to your local representatives, city council, or school board and invite them to visit your school for the Hour of Code. It can help build support for computer science in your area beyond one hour.
- Promote the Hour of Code in your community. [Recruit a local group](https://hourofcode.com/promote/resources#sample-emails) &mdash; boy/girl scouts club, church, university, veterans group, labor union, or even some friends. You don't have to be in school to learn new skills. 
- [Use these posters, banners, stickers, videos and more](https://hourofcode.com/promote/resources) for your own event.


### 4) Recruit other groups in your community

- Any group can host an Hour of Code, whether it is a church, scouts club, local university, library, YMCA, veterans association, or labor union. If you have connections to any such organizations, reach out to them, send them a [participation guide](https://hourofcode.com/promote/resources), and encourage them to visit <https://csedweek.org> and participate.
