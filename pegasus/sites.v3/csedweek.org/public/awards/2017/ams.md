# Anacapa Middle School (Ventura, CA)

### Champion for Computer Science - Outreach Award (School Category)

The Hour of Code exploded schoolwide at Anacapa STEAM. The first year had 60 participants, and Kristie Steinlicht taught her students about computer science using a borrowed set of Chromebooks.

In year two, students were eager to expand Hour of Code into a week-long experience where they would become the teachers - early adopter students taught and provided classroom support to 791 of their peers. The Hour of Code at Anacapa is a multilingual event where students provided coding opportunities in English, Spanish, and Arabic. Kristie coordinated with the district to make more coding opportunities available for all including sending students to teach coding at feeder elementary schools. What started with one teacher, has been taken over by many students. 

Anacapa is a Title I suburban school which serves a socioeconomically, culturally, and linguistically diverse population. The first middle school to be recognized with the California Association for Bilingual Education Seal of Excellence, Anacapa has a Spanish/English Two-Way Immersion program which integrates STEAM to provide opportunities for traditionally underserved students.
