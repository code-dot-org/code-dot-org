# Lawrence Ramos

### Champion for Computer Science - Innovation Award (Teacher Category)

## Emerson Community Charter Middle School (Los Angeles, CA)

When Lawrence started a coding class at Emerson, he only had a little over ten students, and they were mostly boys. It grew to 35 this year and includes both male and female students, as well as students from most demographics represented including Black, Latinx, and Asian students. The coding class is one of the most sought-after Homeroom courses at Emerson and prides itself on students that have gone beyond the courses they learn and frequently enroll in afterschool and summer coding courses. They do not only get interested in coding, but they come to school with a lot of excitement, having identified a purpose and a goal that could give them a lifetime of benefits.

This year, all his class coding projects will focus on creating awareness of environmental issues and in challenging his students to propose solutions through websites, games, and apps. As a special education teacher, he aims to create opportunities for students with special needs and give them access to all curricular requirements by developing their self-advocacy, socio-emotional, and executive functioning skills.

He has taught in elementary special education programs for students with autism and other learning disabilities, teaching in both LA’s inner city and beach city schools. He continues to teach STEM as a coding teacher at Emerson and tries to bring coding to all demographics to make coders out of students of all abilities, instilling in them the knowledge and the consequent passion.
