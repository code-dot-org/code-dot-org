She founded the STEM for All Foundation, a nonprofit organization to champion STEM education for all students, and to encourage girls and other underrepresented sections of society to pursue careers in STEM. She is passionate about the idea that coding should be included in every school’s curriculum at every grade level which would make traditional classrooms more interactive and attractive for students. Over the past two years, she has conducted training sessions for administrators, teachers, and students in Scratch from MIT, App Lab from Code.org, and Alice3 from Oracle. She campaigns for students and teachers to use coding as a presentation tool and has successfully presented to teachers and administrators at various county (RCOE MaTHink & Google Summit), state (California Math Council & California STEAM Symposium), and national level (CUE) conferences.
