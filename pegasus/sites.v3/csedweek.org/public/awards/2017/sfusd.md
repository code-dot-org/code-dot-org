As of the 2017-18 school year, SFUSD has expanded computer science classes to 100% of its middle schools, 100% of its comprehensive high schools, and 40% of its elementary schools. The district has increased participation in computer science courses from 701 students in 2013-14 to 17,175 students in 2017-18, representing 2450% growth.

Thanks to equitable participation in the elementary and middle grades, growth among traditionally underrepresented groups has been even more dramatic. In this same period, there has been 42-fold growth in female participation and 112-fold growth in participation of African American, LatinX, and Native American students.

SFUSD has developed a comprehensive pre-K to grade 12 computer science curriculum pathway. The district has committed to providing engaging, rigorous, and relevant computer science instruction to all students each year in pre-kindergarten through 8th grade, and to offer a menu of classes at all high schools. SFUSD is working hard to actualize this commitment quickly while maintaining focus on equity and quality.
