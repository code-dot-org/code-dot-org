# Ardrey Kell High School (Charlotte, North Carolina)

### Champion of Computer Science - AP CS Principles Diversity Champion

Rachel Robinson’s passion for computer science is obvious. She earned a degree in secondary computer science education when it was a relatively unknown or unavailable program at many colleges, and she currently teaches AP Computer Science at Ardrey Kell High School in Charlotte, North Carolina. Her enthusiasm for the subject helped her school win the AP Diversity Award this year, which is given to the high school with the highest number of female AP Computer Science Principles test takers in schools that use the Code.org AP CSP curriculum.

At Rachel’s school, 117 out of 344 AP CSP test-takers were young women for the 2017-2018 school year!
 
To recruit young women to the course, Rachel worked with student clubs, led sessions at her school’s AP fair and encouraged her fellow career and technical education teachers to host an Hour of Code in their classrooms to get students excited. “I was the only girl in most of my computer science classes and I know that it’s not the same anymore, and it’s because of people like me who really want to get everyone involved,” Rachel told us. Read on to learn more about how she was so successful in recruiting so many young women to take the AP exam:

**1) What does computer science mean to you and your school?**

For most of our student population, computer science is a way for them to interact with computers. They get to take a device or piece of technology they interact with on a regular basis and instead of being on the receiving end, they can take the reins and create whatever content they want. They can take charge of the technology they have available to them.

**2) How did you become so involved in computer science?**

I actually am one of the few people who took advantage of an opportunity that was given to me in college. My background is in secondary CS education. It was not a well-known major when I graduated with it in 1999. I have taught everything from kindergartners to adults who are changing careers. But I love the high school environment and have done most of my teaching in the secondary school environment. It’s absolutely my favorite.

**3) How did you encourage young women to take the AP CSP exam at your school?**

We have an AP open house that happens every spring. We encourage every student who is even interested to show up. When I first spoke with our principal about adding a computer science class, I really wanted to make sure we got in front of as many students as possible. The standard schedule is to have 4 explainer sessions — I did 10. I stood out in the hall and flagged people down because I just wanted to encourage everyone to check it out!

A lot of our students are interested in taking control of their own lives. They gravitated toward being in control of what they were doing, so I think that’s why I was able to recruit so many to take the course. 
 
We’ve also worked with several of our clubs, like the Technology Students Association, Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) and DECA. We even had students who wanted to start up seperate clubs. I’m not the advisor of these clubs, but I partner with all of them. I want to make sure our students see the fun side of technology. When AP CSP was first offered, I encouraged all our career and technical education teachers to participate in Hour of Code, and everyone in the whole department was eager to participate and a lot of students were very receptive.


**4) What does being honored with this award mean to you?** 

It’s a sign that the goal that I've been reaching for for 20 years is finally there. When I went to college, I was the only girl in most of my computer science classes, and I know that it’s not the same anymore, and it’s because of people like me who really want to get everyone involved. I always tell students, ‘don't let it be something you’re afraid to do. There’s more to it than being a nerd.’ It’s really just part of life now.
