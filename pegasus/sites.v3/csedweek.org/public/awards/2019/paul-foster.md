# Paul Foster (Springfield, Massachusetts)

### Champion of Computer Science - Administrator

Over the course of his tenure at Springfield Public Schools, Paul Foster has seen the innovative ways his teachers have brought technology into the classroom and has thrown his full support behind them. But what really motivated him to expand computer science was the data on underrepresented populations. With a district that is 66.6% Hispanic, 18.9% African American and 76.7% economically disadvantaged, he recognized that the district needed to do more to help these students access computer science.

To help bridge the gap, Paul reached out to the University of Massachusetts-Amherst to create a partnership to create an elementary school computer science curriculum for all 33 of the district’s elementary schools. This partnership resulted in a National Science Foundation grant that supports teachers in the writing of a computer science curriculum that will be integrated into all core subjects by the end of 2020. 
 
We asked Paul about computer science and learned more about the amazing work he’s done with his nominator, Melissa Zeitz. Read the Q&A:

**1) What does computer science mean to you and your district?**

Springfield is a district that is serving almost entirely underserved students, and certainly students who are underrepresented in STEM fields and computer science fields. What it means to our district is giving our students every possible chance to be part of STEM and computing fields professionally. We want to make sure our kids are ready for life after high school.

**2) How did you become so involved in computer science?**

I was in this role, I oversee data, research, accountability, technology for the Springfield schools, and part of that responsibility was overseeing what was then instructional technology, so teaching around what you would expect in digital literacy and learning how productivity applications work. Over time, we had some teachers who were doing interesting stuff. There was a parallel of the district starting to do more with technology for use in our teaching and learning practice. As that project evolved, through relationships with our teachers as well as getting to know more people in the higher ed world who were thinking about how to get more CS instruction into K-12. I think just hearing more about that and talking to folks and seeing the data.

**3) What's your relationship to the person who nominated you? What does it mean to you that they nominated you?**

Melissa is one of our rockstars as a teacher. This is my 10th school year in this role and I met her in my first year or two because we did a pilot where we let teachers propose creative and interesting ways to use technology and we would give the money to buy the devices. Melissa had proposed to use iPads in her special education classroom, early in the devices coming into schools. We provided the funding and she was doing exciting stuff. She transitioned from teaching special ed to instructional technology in her elementary school. Over time, she included more and more computer science in her classroom and connected with Code.org and CSTA and other organizations. Since that time, we’ve partnered with the University of Massachusetts-Amherst to get a CSforAll research partnership grant from the National Science Foundation to hire teachers to build integrated computer science modules to go into other content areas. The goal of the project is for all K-5 students to get computer science education each year. 
 
I’m honored and humbled. In many ways, I view my role from the central office as supporting teachers and getting out of the way. The extent to which we’re going to teach computer science to K-5 kids in Springfield is whether our teachers feel they have the training and the resources to do this well.

**4) What does being honored with this award mean to you?** 

I feel this award is a recognition of our district as a whole and our teachers like Melissa. I’m glad to have been a part of clearing the path so we can do this work. I have three kids who I’ve enrolled in our school district. Kids in Springfield are not kids in society who are given an opportunity to dream big. I think there is a lot of opportunity in STEM generally and computer science and I want our kids to have those opportunities to be the people who are building the next phase of technology.
