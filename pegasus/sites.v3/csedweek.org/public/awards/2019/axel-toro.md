# Axel Toro (Aguada, Puerto Rico)

### Champion of Computer Science - Student

Axel Toro had a small idea that grew into a project that could potentially change the lives of millions for the better.

The senior at Dr. Carlos Gonzalez High School in Aguada, Puerto Rico, was relatively new to computer science at the time but was inspired to create an assistive device for people with visual impairments while brainstorming ideas for a science fair project. After learning that more than 36 million people worldwide are blind or visually impaired, he created a pair of smart glasses to help those people navigate their world. The device uses ultrasonic sensors to measure the distance between the wearer and potential obstacles, and a combination of artificial intelligence and a camera to identify objects for the wearer. 

The entire device runs on a Raspberry Pi Zero, which is half the size of a credit card. His computer science teacher, Yamitza Rosas—who also nominated him—says the glasses are low-cost and could “impact the life of millions of people from all around the world, regardless of their economic background.” 

We asked Axel more about his project, as well as his plans to study computer science in the future. Read our Q&A with him below:

**1) What's your relationship to the person who nominated you? What does it mean to you that they nominated you?**

Yamitza Rosas has been my computer science teacher since 2017. It really is a meaningful thing for me. She’s been motivating me toward my goals and aspirations throughout my entire high school career.

**2) What does computer science mean to you?**
At my school, we have only one computer science class. It’s very rare for Puerto Rican schools to offer computer science, but it’s been growing and different schools are starting to integrate computer science. Our school only has one computer science class and it just started three years ago.

I think computer science means a path to be able to impact the world positively through using different integrative technology. Just like AI makes our life easier, I always compare it to a world with less barriers. Computer science means a world that is more connected and more inclusive.

**3) How did you become so involved in computer science?**

My brother is three years older than I am, so when I was in 8th grade, he was in high school. I got to see all the things he did — including the programming — and I got into computer science too. I started taking courses, and experimenting with block-based coding using Scratch, then I went to Arduino.

Then when I had to pick a science fair project, I picked a social impact topic. I read online that there are more than 36 million visually impaired people worldwide, and while I didn't have the knowledge quite yet, I decided to do a project about it. I had the opportunity to develop the project and meet with people from the visually impaired community. Doing this project and seeing the impact on society, I think that is what inspires me to learn computer science and keep innovating in the field. 

I’m planning to study computer engineering in college. It combines my passion for engineering and computer science at the same time. Right now I’m on the sixth iteration of my device, but I haven't actually put on the market. I do have plans to bring the glasses to the community in the future when I can complete the device. 

**4) What does being honored with this award mean to you?** 

It’s really meaningful to me. Code.org is such a large organization, and the Hour of Code is such a big initiative that impacts students and encourages them to study the subject. It really is an awesome experience to be able to receive this award.
