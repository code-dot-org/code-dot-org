# Laginne Walker (New York, New York)

### Champion of Computer Science - Teacher

Laginne Walker is a lifelong learner, and that passion to continue learning is what brought her to teaching computer science. Previously a math teacher, Laginne was introduced to CSforAll in New York City and made the transition to teaching computer science shortly after.

In just over two years, Laginne created a full computer science department at City College Academy of Arts — the only department in the school that offers two AP courses. Her students went from receiving no computer science instruction to having coursework in coding languages, access to a robotics team, and a Girls Who Code chapter. 
 
And her students are excelling! More than 100 students have rolled in her computer science classes, and half of them are enrolled in an AP course. The majority of Laginne’s AP students passed their AP CS Principles exam and a third have since moved on to take AP CSA. 
 
We talked with Laginne about her road to teaching computer science and how she strives to be a role model for her students.

**1) What does computer science mean to you and your school?**

Computer science means using technology to address any problems, anything to make things more efficient — where computers can provide a hand. Students often think it’s just programming. There is the identification of issues they can remedy and they can learn basic computer literacy.

**2) How did you become so involved in computer science?**

I became involved through CSforAll in New York City. They were looking to expand computer science and didn’t have enough people who felt comfortable getting involved. As a math teacher, I felt comfortable since I already used tech in my math lessons. I’m part of Math of America and on my own, I was learning Python. This made my transition to becoming a computer science teacher easier. I went from teaching in a club atmosphere to a full load of CS courses.

**3) What's your relationship to the person who nominated you? What does it mean to you that they nominated you?**

I became acquainted with Sharisse through a program called Dial a Teacher where experienced teachers take calls from kids who need help with their homework. We received calls from all over the country. I got to know Sharisse because she was the go-to for advanced science classes. I nominated her for Math for America when they started accepting science teachers. I think it’s great that she nominated me. I look at her as an expert and I think it’s great that she thinks I’m someone making moves in computer science.

**4) What does being honored with this award mean to you?** 

I think there is value placed on bringing diversity into the tech industry at the school level. That’s where most initiatives start for long-term change. Representation does matter and for my students to see someone who is teaching computer science and continually learning, they’ll think, “Well if she can do it, I can do it.” Teachers do a lot in general that they aren’t always recognized for. For me, this award shows what I’m doing is worth it and deemed important by other people.
