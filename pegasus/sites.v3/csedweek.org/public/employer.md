Code, and to organize their employees to participate.

Subject: The Hour of Code campaign

Our world is surrounded by technology. Information, commerce, communication, and entertainment all rely on computers. But only a tiny fraction of us learn computer science, the basics of how computers work, or how to create software, apps, or web sites.

This year, to celebrate Computer Science Education Week (Dec 9-15), we’re joining a massive campaign to prepare our population for the 21st century.

The Hour of Code campaign has an audacious goal: to introduce 10 million students to one hour of computer science. I encourage all of you to participate, in two ways:

1) As a student - if you yourself wish you knew some computer science, set aside an hour in December to learn the basics.

2) If you’re a parent, recruit your school to participate - ask your teacher or principal if they are hosting Hour of Code in their classrooms.

http://hourofcode.org for details. Sign up to participate!
