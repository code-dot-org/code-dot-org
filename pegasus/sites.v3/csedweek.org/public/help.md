# How to Help

## Host an Hour of Code - at work or in your community
Over 30 million people of all ages have learned an Hour of Code. Join Us. Then, encourage your students to [learn beyond one hour](/learn/beyond), or to sign up for a [local camp or workshop](/learn/local).

## Make a donation to support Computer Science Education Week
Computer Science Education Week is organized by [Code.org](http://code.org), a public 501c3, with support from the general public. We've been overwhelmed by small and large acts of generosity from [individuals and companies](http://code.org/about/donors) who support our vision. All donations made during Computer Science Education Week will be used to recoup the costs of organizing the week, and any additional donations will be saved for future weeks.
