## Lesson Overview 

Having experienced the creation and use of functions and parameters, students will get the opportunity to use the skill in the creation of Play Lab games. Later puzzles incorporate the use of multiple parameters.

[Introduction](#GetStarted) <br/>

### **Activity: Play Lab: Functions with Parameters**

[Artist: Play Lab with Parameters](#Activity)

[/summary]

## Lesson Objectives 
### Students will:

- Identify repeated movements and utilize functions to simplify a program
- Utilize parameters to make one function work for multiple purposes
- Adapt their understanding of functions to allow for the use of multiple parameters

## Getting Started

### <a name="GetStarted"></a> Introduction

While the students will have had some experience creating functions with parameters in earlier stages, this Play Lab stage adds the complexity of using multiple parameters inside a single function.  This is a great opportunity to remind students that it is okay to get frustrated and to use trial and error as an effective learning tool.
