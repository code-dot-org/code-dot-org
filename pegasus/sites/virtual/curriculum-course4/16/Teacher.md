## Getting Started

### <a name="GetStarted"></a> Introduction

This lesson gets complicated rather quickly.  If your students had an easy time with previous lessons, then they should be able to keep up just fine.  If, however, they found the previous stages difficult, you may want to have them revisit Play Lab: Functions with Paramaters first. In this Bee level, students will not only be using multiple parameters iside their functions, they will also be using binary flags (left = 0, right = 1) to allow for logic decisions.
