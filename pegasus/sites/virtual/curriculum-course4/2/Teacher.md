## Lesson Overview 
This course is a review of maze concepts from Courses 2 and 3. Students will first help the zombie get to the sunflower using a combination of sequences and loops, then review conditionals with the flower-hunting bee.

## Lesson Objectives 
### Students will:

- Create a program for a given task using sequential steps
- Count the number of times an action should be repeated and represent it as a loop
- Analyze a problem and complete it as efficiently as possible
- Employ conditional statements to assess which actions are correct for a given step

## Getting Started

### <a name="GetStarted"></a> Introduction
Review with students the basic maze navigation, particularly:

- Moving forward
- Turning left/right
- Looping
- Conditionals

## Activity
### <a name="Activity"></a> [Maze and Bee](http://learn.code.org/s/course4/lessons/2/levels/1)

As your students work through the puzzles, observe how they plan the path for the zombie or bee. Identify different strategies used and ask students to share with the whole class. This helps students to recognize that there are many ways to approach these problems.
You may want to go through a few puzzles on the projector. While doing this you can ask a one student to trace the path on the screen while another writes the directions on a whiteboard.

## Extended Learning 
<a name="Extended"></a>Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### Create Your Own

In small groups, let students design their own mazes and challenge using checkerboards and strips of paper.  Can they recreate a bee conditionals puzzle using red and black checkers?
