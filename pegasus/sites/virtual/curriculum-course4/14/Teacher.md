### **Activity: Artist: Functions with Parameters**

[Artist: Functions with Parameters](#Activity)

[/summary]

## Lesson Objectives 
### Students will:

- Identify repeated movements and utilize functions to simplify a program
- Break complex tasks into smaller repeatable sections
- Combine simple shapes into complex designs with functions
- Utilize parameters to make one function work for multiple purposes

## Getting Started

### <a name="GetStarted"></a> Introduction

Students will have experienced functions through Artist in a previous stage. This stage adds the option of parameters, which will allow one function to work for multiple creations. There may be some confusion over creating parameters inside a function, so it is a good idea to have the class watch the associated video, or to watch a function with parameter being created in advance of the lesson.
