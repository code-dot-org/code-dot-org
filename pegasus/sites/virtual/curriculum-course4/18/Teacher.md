## Lesson Overview 

Rounding out Course 4 is the Artist: Binary lesson. Here, students will build binary images, translating 0s and 1s to offs and ons (or blacks and whites).

[/summary]

## Lesson Objectives 
### Students will:

- Match binary sequences to encoded images
- Utilize loops and binary code to recreate provided images
- Identify repeated sequences and break long codes up into smaller chunks that can be looped
- Create pictures using unique combinations of on and off

## Getting Started

### <a name="GetStarted"></a> Introduction

To begin, it can be helpful to review the previous lesson, specifically different ways of using binary to indicate how to create an image on a grid. This stage will translate the unplugged activity into a simple, independent online lesson.
