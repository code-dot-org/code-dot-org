## Lesson Overview 
Students use the Bee environment to write programs that use loops with embedded counters/index variables.  These loops are called for loops, and they utilize predetermined start and stop values.

## Lesson Objectives 
### Students will:

- Break one long sequence of steps into shorter looped sequences 
- Use the "for loop" structure to repeat an action a variable number of times each iteration

## Activity
### <a name="Activity"></a> [Bee: For Loops](http://learn.code.org/s/course4/stage/9/puzzle/1)

This activity walks students through the differences between loops and for loops. In many cases, it is possible to solve problems with brute force that can easily be solved using for loops instead. As you walk around, look for students who are correctly using for loops and counters, then point out why the counters make the program easier.

The final stage counts down, collecting less nectar as the counter increases.  This is expected to cause a small amount of frustration.  Encourage students to talk about what is supposed to be happening out loud.  That should help them stumble upon the answer on their own.
