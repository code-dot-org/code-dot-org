## Lesson Overview 
This is a review of loops and nested loops. Students will use the traditional artist character, as well as a very artistic zombie, to complete and recreate repetitive drawings.

## Lesson Objectives 
### Students will:

- Create programs that utilize repetition to create gorgeous designs
- Use trial and error to recreate detailed designs in proper scale
- Divide the number of degrees in a circle into even segments
- Calculate the angles in equilateral and 30 60 90 triangles
- Decompose a shape into its smallest repeatable sequence

## Getting Started

### <a name="GetStarted"></a> Introduction
Review with students the basic artist navigation, particularly:

- Moving forward
- Turning left/right
- Looping
- Angles

## Activity
### <a name="Activity"></a> [Artist: Loops Review](http://learn.code.org/s/course4/stage/3/puzzle/1)

Students will see a variety of shapes in this lesson.  Some of the designs get pretty intricate. Your class may find it helpful to have a protractor and paper on hand. Feel free to promote trial and error as well.

## Extended Learning 
<a name="Extended"></a>Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### Paper Snowflakes

Hand your class small square sheets of paper and have them fold the papers in half then cut simple designs.  How many times is the design repeated?  What are the points of symmetry? What happens when you fold another piece of paper a second time and cut a pattern?  How many times is it repeated?  What do you think will happen if you fold the paper three times?  Four?
