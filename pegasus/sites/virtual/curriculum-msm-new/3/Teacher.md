# Teaching Guide

## Getting Started


### <a name="Vocab"></a> 1) Vocabulary
This lesson has four new and important words:<br/>

- **String** - any sequence of characters between quotation marks (examples: "hello", "42", "this is a string!")
- **Image** - a type of data for pictures
- **Produce** - to compute a value from an expression
- **Type** - refers to a general kind of data, like Number, String, Image, or Boolean

### <a name="GetStarted"></a> 2) Introduction

In the previous stage, you only worked with a single type of value - Numbers. In this next stage you'll get a chance to write programs that with new data types to output text (Strings) and pictures (Images).
