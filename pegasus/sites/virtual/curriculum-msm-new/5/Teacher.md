## Getting Started

This plugged lesson only requires access to computers.


### <a name="GetStarted"></a> 1) Introduction

Recall with students the purpose of a Contract:

- Describes three elements of a function
    - Name (what is the function called)
    - Domain (what inputs does it take)
    - Range (what does it output)
- As a class, describe the Contracts for some basic mathematical operators
    - Addition (name +, domain Number Number, range Number)
    - Subtraction (name -, domain Number Number, range Number)
    - Multiplication (name *, domain Number Number, range Number)
    - Power of two (name sqr, domain Number, range Number)

## Activity: Eval Writing Contracts
### <a name="Activity1"></a> 3) Online Puzzles

In this stage you'll be looking at some functions, some of which you've seen before and some which are brand new. For each function you'll first get a chance to use the function, and then you will write a Contract for it. Make sure to document any new Contracts on your Contract Log. Head to [MSM stage 5](http://studio.code.org/s/msm/stage/5/puzzle/1) in Code Studio to get started programming.
