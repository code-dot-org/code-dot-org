## Lesson Overview

In this plugged activity, students will learn to define variables that store values and expressions that can be used repeatedly throughout a program. It's important to note that in some programming languages variables are consider mutable, in that their value can be changed throughout the running of the programming. In Evaluation Blocks, as in Algebra, variables are considered immutable - the value of a variable cannot be modified during the excecution of the program.
