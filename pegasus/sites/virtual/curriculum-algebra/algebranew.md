# Computer Science in Algebra
### Powered by Bootstrap, Preferred Provider for Professional Development

Code.org has partnered with [Bootstrap](http://www.BootstrapWorld.org) to develop a curriculum which teaches algebraic and geometric concepts through computer programming. The two ten hour courses focus on concepts like order of operations, the Cartesian plane, function composition and definition, and solving word problems. By shifting classwork from abstract pencil-and-paper problems to a series of relevant programming problems, Code.org CS in Algebra demonstrates how algebra applies in the real world, using an exciting, hands-on approach to create something cool.

At the end of the course, students will have written programs to build composite images, animations, and after course B a complete video game of their own design, all of which can be shared to demonstrate mastery of programming and algebra. For more information, you can view our [Course Overview](/curriculum/docs/algebra/overview) and [Course Framework](/curriculum/docs/algebra/framework).

CS in Algebra is aligned to Common Core Standards for Mathematics, making it possible to integrate our curriculum into the classroom smoothly. CS in Algebra is also a model implementation of Common Core Standards for Mathematical Practice, offering explicit pedagogical recommendation across all eight practice standards. Our curriculum also satisfies several of the CSTA (Computer Science Teacher's Association) standards across levels 1 (grades K-6) and 2 (grades 6-9). For more information, you can view our [complete standards alignment](/curriculum/docs/algebra/standards).

## The Two Courses

### CS in Algebra Course A
The first 10 hour course provides students with the fundamental skills and knowledge to begin using computer programming as a tool to learn about and develop Algebraic functions. Students will be introduced to a graphical programming language designed for Algebra instruction, through which they will gain a deeper understanding of the order of operations, create images with algebraic expressions, and learn a teachnique for creating functions call the Design Recipe. By the end of Course A students will have the tools necessary to turn word problems from their own Algebra class into functions that can be used as mini apps.

### CS in Algebra Course B
The second 10 hour course builds on the skills students developed in Course A through the development of a simple video game. Students will explore more advanced topics such as booleans and conditionals, all along building the small component functions that will eventually drive the logic in their culminating game.
