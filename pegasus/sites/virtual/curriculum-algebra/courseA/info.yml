title: Course A
description: "Students discuss the components of their favorite video games, and discover that they can be reduced to a series of coordinates. They then explore coordinates in Cartesian space and identify the coordinates for the characters in a game at various points in time. Once they are comfortable with coordinates, they brainstorm their own games and create sample coordinate lists for different points in time in their own game."
