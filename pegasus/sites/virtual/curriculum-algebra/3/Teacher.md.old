# Teaching Guide

## Getting Started


### <a name="Vocab"></a> 1) Vocabulary
This lesson has four new and important words:<br/>

- **String** - any sequence of characters between quotation marks (examples: "hello", "42", "this is a string!")
- **Image** - a type of data for pictures
- **Produce** - to compute a value from an expression
- **Type** - refers to a general kind of data, like Number, String, Image, or Boolean

### <a name="GetStarted"></a> 2) Introduction

In the previous stage, you only worked with a single type of value - Numbers. In this next stage you'll get a chance to write programs that with new data types to output text (Strings) and pictures (Images).

## Activity: Eval Strings and Images
### <a name="Activity1"></a> 3) Online Puzzles

In this activity you'll use the new data types String and Image to compose art with Blocks of Evaluation - head to [MSM Stage 3](http://studio.code.org/s/algebra/lessons/3/levels/1) in Code Studio to get started programming.

### Common Core Mathematical Practices
 
- 1. Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.
- 2. Reason abstractly and quantitatively.
- 3. Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.
- 4. Model with mathematics.
- 5. Use appropriate tools strategically.
- 6. Attend to precision.
- 7. Look for and make use of structure.
- 8. Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.

### Common Core Math Standards

- A-SSE.1-2: The student interprets the structure of expressions to solve problems in context.
- F-IF.1-3: The student uses function notation to describe, evaluate, and interpret functions in terms of domain and range.
- N-Q: The student reasons quantitatively in using units to solve problems.

### CSTA K-12 Computer Science Standards

- L1:6:CPP.6: Implement problem solutions using a block-based visual programming language.
