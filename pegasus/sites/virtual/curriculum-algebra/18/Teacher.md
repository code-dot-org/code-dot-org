# Teaching Guide

## Getting Started

### <a name="GetStarted"></a> 1) Introduction

Remind students of the game they played in the last stage, what were some of the tricky elements of constructing a good conditional statement?

- Order matters (the first condition in the list to return true wins!).
- Write clear and explicit conditions.
- Use the else clause as a catch all for conditions that you don't expect or can't write explicit conditions for.
- All conditionals must have at least on condition and an else statment, you can add or remove further condition as using the blue buttons.
