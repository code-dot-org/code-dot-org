# Videos for CS in Math: Bootstrap

Code.org has partnered with [Bootstrap](http://www.bootstrapworld.org/) to offer their introductory curriculum which teaches algebraic and geometric concepts through computer programming. The nine units focus on concepts such as order of operations, the Cartesian plane, function composition and definition, and solving word problems - all within the context of video game design. By shifting classwork from abstract pencil-and-paper problems to a series of relevant programming problems, Bootstrap demonstrates how algebra applies in the real world, using an exciting, hands-on approach to create something cool.

These videos were created as part of the CS in Math professional development program. The nine videos are intended for teachers to build their background knowledge in preparation to teach the [CS in Math: Bootstrap Curriculum](/curriculum/msm).

The videos introduce teachers to the curriculum materials and tools,  data modeling and coordinates planes, multiple representations of functions, using design recipes to solve problems, and more concepts vital in game design.
