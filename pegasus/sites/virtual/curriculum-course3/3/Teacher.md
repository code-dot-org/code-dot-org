## Lesson Overview 
This course is a review of artist concepts from Course 2. Students will draw images with the artist using a combination of sequences and loops.

## Lesson Objectives 
### Students will:

- Count the number of times an action should be repeated and represent it as a loop
- Divide the number of degrees in a circle into even segments
- Calculate the angles in equilateral and 30 60 90 triangles
- Given a perimeter and one side of a rectangle, calculate the remaining sides
- Identify symmetrical shapes
- Decompose a shape into its smallest repeatable sequence

## Getting Started

### <a name="GetStarted"></a> Introduction
Review with students the basic maze navigation, particularly:

- Moving vs Jumping
- Turning by degrees
- Looping

## Activity
### <a name="Activity"></a> [Artist](http://learn.code.org/s/course3/stage/3/puzzle/1)

In the Artist levels students are not constrained to 90 degree angles. Having protractors available can be help students better visualize the angles they need.

## Extended Learning 
<a name="Extended"></a>Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### The Copy Machine
- Give students two pieces of paper
- On one sheet have the students draw a simple image
- On the second sheet draw instructions for recreating that image commands to move straight and turn at various angles.
- Trade instruction sheets and attempt to recreate the image using only the provided instructions.

### Common Core Math Standards
- 3.OA.3 - Use multiplication and division within 100 to solve word problems in situations involving equal groups, arrays, and measurement quantities.
- 3.G.A.2 - Partition shapes into parts with equal areas. Express the area of each part as a unit fraction of the whole.
- 4.NBT.B.4 - Fluently add and subtract multi-digit whole numbers using the standard algorithm.
- 4.MD.A.3 - Apply the area and perimeter formulas for rectangles in real world and mathematical problems.
- 4.MD.C.5 - Recognize angles as geometric shapes that are formed wherever two rays share a common endpoint, and understand concepts of angle measurement.
- 4.MD.C.7 - Recognize angle measure as additive.
- 4.G.A.1 - Draw points, lines, line segments, rays, angles (right, acute, obtuse), and perpendicular and parallel lines.
- 4.G.A.2 - Classify two-dimensional figures based on the presence or absence of parallel or perpendicular lines, or the presence or absence of angles of a specified size.
- 4.G.A.3 -Recognize a line of symmetry for a two-dimensional figure as a line across the figure such that the figure can be folded along the line into matching part.
- 5.NBT.B.5 - Fluently multiply multi-digit whole numbers using the standard algorithm.
- 5.G.A.2 - Represent real world and mathematical problems by graphing points in the first quadrant of the coordinate plane, and interpret coordinate values of points in the context of the situation.

- L.4.6 - Acquire and use accurately grade-appropriate general academic and domain-specific words and phrases, including those that signal precise actions, emotions, or states of being and that are basic to a particular topic.
- L.5.6 - Acquire and use accurately grade-appropriate general academic and domain-specific words and phrases, including those that signal contrast, addition, and other logical relationships
