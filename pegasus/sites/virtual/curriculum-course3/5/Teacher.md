## Lesson Overview 

As an introduction to functions (reuseable blocks of code), students will use functions to draw shapes on the screen and modify those functions to fit different purposes.

## Lesson Objectives 
### Students will:

- Use a pre-determined function to draw an image with repeated features
- Modify an existing function to draw a different shape
- Distinguish between functions and loops
- Create a program that calls a function from within a loop

## Getting Started

### <a name="GetStarted"></a> Introduction

Reflect with students on the Functional Suncatchers unplugged activity

- What functions did we use to make suncatchers?
- Why did we use functions?
- Now we're going to use functions to make drawing cool images even easier!

## Activity
### <a name="Activity"></a> [Artist: Functions](http://learn.code.org/s/course3/lessons/5/levels/1)

Some students may struggle with the difference between the function definition (the actual code of the function) and the function call (used when we tell functions to run). As a visual cue we've place the function definition inside a grey box - you can equate this to the separate sheet they used to write suncatcher functions.

## Extended Learning 
<a name="Extended"></a>Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### Shape Machines 
Ask students to write functions on paper for simple shapes, then create a list of instructions using those functions to draw a picture.
