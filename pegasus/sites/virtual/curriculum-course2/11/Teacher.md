## Lesson Overview 

In this stage, students will continue practicing their debugging skills by helping the Artist to fix pictures that aren't coming out quite right.

## Lesson Objectives 
### Students will:

- Predict where a program will fail
- Modify an existing program to solve errors
- Identify an algorithm that is unsuccessful when the steps are out of order
- Reflect on the debugging process in an age-appropriate way

## Getting Started

### <a name="GetStarted"></a> Introduction

By now students should be pretty comfortable digging in and finding bugs. This is a great time to bring the class together to share debugging tactics and difficulties.

- What kinds of bugs are easiest for you to see? Why?
- Which bugs were the hardest to find? How did you eventually fix them?
- What's the first thing you look for in a buggy program?

## Activity
### <a name="Activity"></a> [Artist: Debugging](http://learn.code.org/s/course2/lessons/11/levels/1)

Some students are averse to running a program until they've fixed it. Sometimes the easiest way to figure out what's wrong with a program is to watch it fail, so there's nothing wrong with running a program before we've finished fixing it. The only time we care if they got it right the first time is on the assessment levels.

## Extended Learning 
<a name="Extended"></a>Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### Planting bugs

Have students go back through previous levels, purposefully adding bugs to their solutions. They can then ask other students to debug their work. This can also be done with paper puzzles.

### CSTA K-12 Computer Science Standards
 
- CL.L1:3-02. Work cooperatively and collaboratively with peers teachers, and others using technology.
- CT.L1:3-01. Use technology resources (e.g., puzzles, logical thinking programs) to solve age appropriate problems.
- CT.L1:6-01. Understand and use the basic steps in algorithmic problem-solving.

### Next-Gen Science Standards

- K-2-PS3-2. Use tools and materials provided to design and build a device that solves a specific problem or a solution to a specific problem.
- K-2-ETS1-1 - Ask questions, make observations, and gather information about a situation people want to change to define a simple problem that can be solved through the development of a new or improved object or tool. 
- 3-5-ETS1-2 - Generate and compare multiple possible solutions to a problem based on how well each is likely to meet the criteria and constraints of the problem. 

### Common Core Mathematical Practices
 
- 1. Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.
- 2. Reason abstractly and quantitatively.
- 4. Model with mathematics.
- 5. Use appropriate tools strategically.
- 6. Attend to precision.
- 7. Look for and make use of structure.
- 8. Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.

### Common Core Math Standards

- 1.OA.1 - Use addition and subtraction within 20 to solve word problems involving situations of adding to, taking from, putting together, taking apart, and comparing, with unknowns in all positions, e.g., by using objects, drawings, and equations.
- 1.G.A.1 - Distinguish between defining attributes (e.g., triangles are closed and three-sided) versus non-defining attributes (e.g., color, orientation, overall size); build and draw shapes to possess defining attributes.
- 1.G.A.2 - Compose two-dimensional shapes (rectangles, squares, trapezoids, triangles, half-circles, and quarter-circles) or three-dimensional shapes (cubes, right rectangular prisms, right circular cones, and right circular cylinders) to create a composite shape, and compose new shapes from the composite shape.
- 2.OA.1 - Use addition and subtraction within 100 to solve one- and two-step word problems involving situations of adding to, taking from, putting together, taking apart, and comparing, with unknowns in all positions.
- 2.G.A.1 - Recognize and draw shapes having specified attributes, such as a given number of angles or a given number of equal faces. 
- 3.OA.3 - Use multiplication and division within 100 to solve word problems in situations involving equal groups, arrays, and measurement quantities.
- 3.G.A.2 - Partition shapes into parts with equal areas. Express the area of each part as a unit fraction of the whole.

### Common Core Language Arts Standards

- SL.1.1 - Participate in collaborative conversations with diverse partners about grade 1 topics and texts with peers and adults in small and larger groups.
- L.1.6 - Use words and phrases acquired through conversations, reading and being read to, and responding to texts, including using frequently occurring conjunctions to signal simple relationships (e.g., because).
- SL.2.1 - Participate in collaborative conversations with diverse partners about grade 2 topics and texts with peers and adults in small and larger groups.
- L.2.6 - Use words and phrases acquired through conversations, reading and being read to, and responding to texts, including using adjectives and adverbs to describe (e.g., When other kids are happy that makes me happy).
- SL.3.1 - Engage effectively in a range of collaborative discussions (one-on-one, in groups, and teacher-led) with diverse partners on grade 3 topics and texts, building on others' ideas and expressing their own clearly.
- L.3.6 - Acquire and use accurately grade-appropriate conversational, general academic, and domain-specific words and phrases, including those that signal spatial and temporal relationships.
