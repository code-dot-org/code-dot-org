## Lesson Overview 
In the last stage students used loops to repeat simple movements. Now they're going to add to that the looping of actions in order to help the bee collect more nectar and make more honey.

## Lesson Objectives 
### Students will:

- Write a program for a given task which loops a single command
- Identify when a loop can be used to simplify a repetitive action
- Employ a combination of sequential and looped commands to move and perform actions

## Getting Started

### <a name="GetStarted"></a> Introduction

- What daily activites do you do that could be described as a loop?
- If you wanted someone to give you 5 cookies, how would you ask them to do it?
    - Push for a detailed descripton on this one. How can I take a cookie if the cookie jar is closed? How can I reach the cookie jar if I'm not in the kitchen?
- It's obviously far more efficient to do this activity as a loop, instead of laboriously giving all of the instructions for getting a cookie 5 times.
- We're going to help the bee be more efficient by looping the instructions to get lots of nectar and make lots of honey.

## Extended Learning 
<a name="Extended"></a>Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### So Moving

- Give the students pictures of actions or dance moves that they can do.
  - Have students arrange moves and add loops to choreograph their own dance.
- Share the dances with the rest of the class.

### Connect It Back

- Find some YouTube videos of popular dances that repeat themselves.
- Can your class find the loops?
- Try the same thing with songs!

### CSTA K-12 Computer Science Standards
 
- CT.L1:3-01. Use technology resources (e.g., puzzles, logical thinking programs) to solve age appropriate problems.
- CL.L1:3-02. Work cooperatively and collaboratively with peers teachers, and others using technology.
- CPP.L1:6-05. Construct a program as a set of step-by-step instructions to be acted out.
- CPP.L1:6-06. Implement problem solutions using a block-based visual programming language.
- CT.L2-01. Use the basic steps in algorithmic problem solving to design solutions.
- CT.L2-06. Describe and analyze a sequence of instructions being followed.
- CT.L2-08. Use visual representations of problem states, structures, and data.
- CT.L2-12. Use abstraction to decompose a problem into sub problems. 

### Next-Gen Science Standards

- K-2-PS3-2. Use tools and materials provided to design and build a device that solves a specific problem or a solution to a specific problem.
- K-2-ETS1-1. Ask questions, make observations, and gather information about a situation people want to change to define a simple problem that can be solved through the development of a new or improved object or tool.
- K-ESS3-1. Use a model to represent the relationship between the needs of different plants and animals (including humans) and the places they live.

### Common Core Mathematical Practices
 
- 1. Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.
- 2. Reason abstractly and quantitatively.
- 4. Model with mathematics.
- 5. Use appropriate tools strategically.
- 6. Attend to precision.
- 7. Look for and make use of structure.
- 8. Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.

### Common Core Math Standards

- K.CC.B.4 - Understand the relationship between numbers and quantities; connect counting to cardinality.
- K.OA.A.3 - Decompose numbers less than or equal to 10 into pairs in more than one way, e.g., by using objects or drawings, and record each decomposition by a drawing or equation (e.g., 5 = 2 + 3 and 5 = 4 + 1).
- K.OA.A.5 - Fluently add and subtract within 5.
- K.G.A.1 - Describe objects in the environment using names of shapes, and describe the relative positions of these objects using terms such as above, below, beside, in front of, behind, and next to.
- 1.OA.A.1 - Use addition and subtraction within 20 to solve word problems involving situations of adding to, taking from, putting together, taking apart, and comparing, with unknowns in all positions, e.g., by using objects, drawings, and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem.
- 2.OA.A.1 - Use addition and subtraction within 100 to solve one- and two-step word problems involving situations of adding to, taking from, putting together, taking apart, and comparing, with unknowns in all positions, e.g., by using drawings and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem.

### Common Core Language Arts Standards

- SL.K.1 - Participate in collaborative conversations with diverse partners about kindergarten topics and texts with peers and adults in small and larger groups.
- L.K.6 - Use words and phrases acquired through conversations, reading and being read to, and responding to texts.
- SL.1.1 - Participate in collaborative conversations with diverse partners about grade 1 topics and texts with peers and adults in small and larger groups.
- L.1.6 - Use words and phrases acquired through conversations, reading and being read to, and responding to texts, including using frequently occurring conjunctions to signal simple relationships (e.g., because).
- SL.2.1 - Participate in collaborative conversations with diverse partners about grade 2 topics and texts with peers and adults in small and larger groups.
- L.2.6 - Use words and phrases acquired through conversations, reading and being read to, and responding to texts, including using adjectives and adverbs to describe (e.g., When other kids are happy that makes me happy).
