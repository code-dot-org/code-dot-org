## Lesson Overview
Returning to the Artist, the puzzles in this stage are focused on drawing, combining, and dividing squares and rectangles.

## Lesson Objectives
### Students will:

- Create a program to draw a shape using sequential steps
- Explain the difference between squares and rectangles and support it with evidence consisting of the commands used to draw the different shapes
- Compare the positions of different objects using "above," "below," "next to"
- Correctly identify shapes regardless of their overall size
- Compare and contrast squares and rectangles by their number of sides and side lengths

## Getting Started

### <a name="GetStarted"></a> Introduction
Before beginning this lesson, students should have a basic understanding of squares and rectangles.

- How do you make a square? A rectangle?
- What happens when you put two squares next to each other?

## Activity
### <a name="Activity"></a> [Artist: Shapes](http://learn.code.org/s/course1/lessons/10/levels/1)

If students struggle to use the correct number of blocks to draw a line, point out that each line segment has a dot on both ends.

## Extended Learning
<a name="Extended"></a>Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### The Copy Machine
- Give students two pieces of paper
- On one sheet have the students draw a simple image (right angles and straight lines only)
- On the second sheet draw instructions for recreating that image using a series of arrows
- Trade instruction sheets and attempt to recreate the image using only the provided instructions.

### ISTE Standards (formerly NETS)

- 1.a - Apply existing knowledge to generate new ideas, products, or processes.
- 1.b - Create original works as a means of personal or group processes.
- 1.c - Use models and simulation to explore complex systems and issues.
- 4.b - Plan and manage activities to develop a solution or complete a project.
- 6.a - Understand and use technology systems.
- 6.c - Troubleshoot systems and applications.
- 6.d - Transfer current knowledge to learning of new technologies.


### CSTA K-12 Computer Science Standards


- CL.L1:3-02. Work cooperatively and collaboratively with peers teachers, and others using technology.
- CT.L1:3-01. Use technology resources (e.g., puzzles, logical thinking programs) to solve age appropriate problems.
- CPP.L1:6-05. Construct a program as a set of step-by-step instructions to be acted out.
- CPP.L1:6-06. Implement problem solutions using a block-based visual programming language.
- CT.L2-01. Use the basic steps in algorithmic problem solving to design solutions.
- CT.L2-06. Describe and analyze a sequence of instructions being followed.
- CT.L2-08. Use visual representations of problem states, structures, and data.
- CT.L2-12. Use abstraction to decompose a problem into sub problems.

### Next-Gen Science Standards

- K-2-PS3-2. Use tools and materials provided to design and build a device that solves a specific problem or a solution to a specific problem.

### Common Core Mathematical Practices

- 1. Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.
- 2. Reason abstractly and quantitatively.
- 4. Model with mathematics
- 5. Use appropriate tools strategically.
- 6. Attend to precision.
- 7. Look for and make use of structure.
- 8. Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.

### Common Core Math Standards

- K.G.A.1 - Describe objects in the environment using names of shapes, and describe the relative positions of these objects using terms such as above, below, beside, in front of, behind, and next to.
- K.G.A.2 - Correctly name shapes regardless of their orientations or overall size.
- K.G.B.6 - Compose simple shapes to form larger shapes. For example, "Can you join these two triangles with full sides touching to make a rectangle?"
- 1.G.A.1 - Distinguish between defining attributes (e.g., triangles are closed and three-sided) versus non-defining attributes (e.g., color, orientation, overall size); build and draw shapes to possess defining attributes.
- 1.G.A.2 - Compose two-dimensional shapes (rectangles, squares, trapezoids, triangles, half-circles, and quarter-circles) or three-dimensional shapes (cubes, right rectangular prisms, right circular cones, and right circular cylinders) to create a composite shape, and compose new shapes from the composite shape.
- 1.G.A.3 - Partition circles and rectangles into two and four equal shares, describe the shares using the words halves, fourths, and quarters, and use the phrases half of, fourth of, and quarter of. Describe the whole as two of, or four of the shares. Understand for these examples that decomposing into more equal shares creates smaller shares.
- 2.G.A.1 - Recognize and draw shapes having specified attributes, such as a given number of angles or a given number of equal faces.1 Identify triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons, hexagons, and cubes.

### Common Core Language Arts Standards

- SL.K.1 - Participate in collaborative conversations with diverse partners about kindergarten topics and texts with peers and adults in small and larger groups.
- SL.K.5 - Add drawings or other visual displays to descriptions as desired to provide additional detail.
- L.K.6 - Use words and phrases acquired through conversations, reading and being read to, and responding to texts.
- SL.1.1 - Participate in collaborative conversations with diverse partners about grade 1 topics and texts with peers and adults in small and larger groups.
- SL.1.5 - Add drawings or other visual displays to descriptions when appropriate to clarify ideas, thoughts, and feelings.
- L.1.6 - Use words and phrases acquired through conversations, reading and being read to, and responding to texts, including using frequently occurring conjunctions to signal simple relationships.
- SL.2.1 - Participate in collaborative conversations with diverse partners about grade 2 topics and texts with peers and adults in small and larger groups.
- L.2.6 - Use words and phrases acquired through conversations, reading and being read to, and responding to texts, including using adjectives and adverbs to describe.
