## Lesson Overview 
In this series of puzzles, students will build on the understanding of algorithms learned in the Happy Maps and Move It Unplugged activities. Featuring characters from the game Angry Birds, students will develop sequential algorithms to move a bird from one side of the maze to the pig at the other side.

## Lesson Objectives 
### Students will:

- Order movement commands as sequential steps in a program
- Represent an algorithm as a computer program
- Count the number of times an action should be executed and represent it as instructions in a program

## Getting Started

### <a name="GetStarted"></a> Introduction
Ask your students if they are familiar with the game Angry Birds. Explain that they will be writing programs to help an Angry Bird locate a Pig.

- Review cardinal directions.
- Use the NEWS mnemonic and let students know that they will see those letters in their programs next to the direction arrows.
- Getting the bird to the pig will require putting your directions in a very specific order or sequence.
- Can you solve the puzzles using the fewest blocks possible?

# Lesson Tip
Encourage students to continue using the pair programming method that they learned in the last lesson. Ask them to restate the roles of the driver and navigator.

## Activity
### <a name="Activity"></a> [Maze: Sequence](http://learn.code.org/s/course1/lessons/4/levels/1)
As your students work through the puzzles, observe how they plan the path for the bird. Identify different strategies used and ask students to share with the whole class. This helps students to recognize that there are many ways to approach these problems.
You may want to go through a few puzzles on the projector. While doing this you can ask a one student to trace the path on the screen while another writes the directions on a whiteboard.

## Extended Learning 
<a name="Extended"></a>Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### Create Your Own

In small groups, let students design their own mazes and challenge each other to write programs to solve them.
For added fun, make life-size mazes with students as the pig and bird.

### Next-Gen Science Standards
- K-2-ETS1-1. Ask questions, make observations, and gather information about a situation people want to change to define a simple problem that can be solved through the development of a new or improved object or tool. 

### Common Core Mathematical Practices
 
- 1. Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.
- 2. Reason abstractly and quantitatively.
- 5. Use appropriate tools strategically.
- 6. Attend to precision.
- 7. Look for and make use of structure.
- 8. Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.

### Common Core Math Standards

- K.G.A.1 - Describe objects in the environment using names of shapes, and describe the relative positions of these objects using terms such as above, below, beside, in front of, behind, and next to.
- K.CC.B.4 - Understand the relationship between numbers and quantities; connect counting to cardinality.
- K.OA.A.3 - Decompose numbers less than or equal to 10 into pairs in more than one way, e.g., by using objects or drawings, and record each decomposition by a drawing or equation (e.g., 5 = 2 + 3 and 5 = 4 + 1).
- K.OA.A.5 - Fluently add and subtract within 5.
- 1.OA.A.1 - Use addition and subtraction within 20 to solve word problems involving situations of adding to, taking from, putting together, taking apart, and comparing, with unknowns in all positions, e.g., by using objects, drawings, and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem.
- 2.OA.A.1 - Use addition and subtraction within 100 to solve one- and two-step word problems involving situations of adding to, taking from, putting together, taking apart, and comparing, with unknowns in all positions, e.g., by using drawings and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem.
- 2.G.A.2 - Partition a rectangle into rows and columns of same-size squares and count to find the total number of them.
