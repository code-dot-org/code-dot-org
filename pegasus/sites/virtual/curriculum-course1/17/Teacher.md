This is a great time to review the last lesson that you went through with your class.  You can do this as one large group or have students discuss with an elbow partner.

Here are some questions that you can ask in review:

- What did we do last time?

- What do you wish we had had a chance to do?

- Did you think of any questions after the lesson that you want to ask?

- What was your favorite part of the last lesson?

![](vocab.png)

[/centerIt]

**Username** - Say it with me: Yews-er-naym <br/>
A name you make up so that you can see or do things on a website, sometimes called a “screen name”

### <a name="GetStarted"></a> 3) Where We Go
- Invite students to talk about places they have visited on a class field trip. 
  - If students have limited experience with field trips, provide some examples of the types of places they could visit as a class, such as museums, science centers, or zoos.
  - Have students choose a place they would like to go on a class field trip.
- Have students take an imaginary field trip to their chosen place. 
  - Narrate the preparations while having students pantomime what’s happening 
     – For example: put on your jacket; climb on/off the bus; get your ticket checked; go inside.
     - Have students describe what they think they might see and do once they arrive.
- Let the students sit back down, then ask: "What do you need to do to stay safe when
you visit new places?"

## Activities: (20 min)
### <a name="Activity1"></a> 4) Keep It Private

Access [SecretBuilders](http://www.secretbuilders.com/gameplay/gameplay.html) sign-up page live, or project a print-out on the board for the class to see.

- Invite students to give examples of information that they should keep private. 
  - Write down their responses on the board or chart paper so that you can return to them later in the lesson. 
- Make sure they understand that private information includes the following:
  - full name
  - age
  - address
  - telephone number
  - email address (or parents’ email addresses)
  - where they go to school or after school
  - where their parents work
- Encourage students to discuss why it is important to keep this information private. 
  - Stress that it is never safe to give out private information to people they don’t know. 
  - Students should always ask a parent or caregiver before they give out private information to anyone.
- Refer back to the sign-up page.
  - Ask "Do you think you should use your real name, or something that includes your real name, when you make up a username?"
  
  
Guide students through the following rules and tips for creating usernames:

**Rules:**

> 1) Ask a parent or other trusted adult before you create a username.
> 2) Never include any private information in your username, such as your real name, age, birthday, the
name of your school or hometown, parts of your address or phone number, or email address.
> 3) Avoid using symbols or spaces, as they are usually not allowed in usernames.

> **Tips**
>> 1) Include the name of something that will help you remember your username, like your favorite animal, character, or toy. You might have to combine this with other words or numbers.

>> 2) If the username you create is already taken, you will have to come up with another one.

>> 3) Write down your username and password and, with the help of a parent, find a safe place to keep it
in case you forget them. 

Distribute paper and place students in pairs.

**Directions:**

> 1) Have students interview their partner using the following questions, and write down their responses:
- What is your favorite pet or animal?
- What is your favorite TV show, book, or movie character?
- What are your favorite numbers?

> 2) Instruct students to make up three safe usernames for their partner using information from their interview responses. 
- They should not include their partner’s name, age, school, email address, birthday, or any other private information.

> 3) Invite students to share one or more of their usernames with the class.
 
> 4) Encourage students to respond to one another’s usernames, confirming that each name follows the rules they have learned.
