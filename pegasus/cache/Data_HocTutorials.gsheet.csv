Computing Practice & Programming (CPP): 5. Implement problem solutions using a programming language, including: looping behavior, conditional statements, logic, expressions, variables, and functions.


Common Core Math: 
CCSS.MATH.PRACTICE.MP1 Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.

Grade 1: 
CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.1.G.A.2
Compose two-dimensional shapes (rectangles, squares, trapezoids, triangles, half-circles, and quarter-circles) or three-dimensional shapes (cubes, right rectangular prisms, right circular cones, and right circular cylinders) to create a composite shape, and compose new shapes from the composite shape.

Grade 2: 
CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.2.G.A.1
Recognize and draw shapes having specified attributes, such as a given number of angles or a given number of equal faces.1 Identify triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons, hexagons, and cubes.

Grade 3: 
CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.3.G.A.1
Understand that shapes in different categories (e.g., rhombuses, rectangles, and others) may share attributes (e.g., having four sides), and that the shared attributes can define a larger category (e.g., quadrilaterals). Recognize rhombuses, rectangles, and squares as examples of quadrilaterals, and draw examples of quadrilaterals that do not belong to any of these subcategories.

Grade 4: 
CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.4.G.A.1
Draw points, lines, line segments, rays, angles (right, acute, obtuse), and perpendicular and parallel lines. Identify these in two-dimensional figures.

CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.4.G.A.3
Recognize a line of symmetry for a two-dimensional figure as a line across the figure such that the figure can be folded along the line into matching parts. Identify line-symmetric figures and draw lines of symmetry.

Grade 5: 
CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.5.G.A.2
Represent real world and mathematical problems by graphing points in the first quadrant of the coordinate plane, and interpret coordinate values of points in the context of the situation.

CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.5.G.B.3
Understand that attributes belonging to a category of two-dimensional figures also belong to all subcategories of that category. For example, all rectangles have four right angles and squares are rectangles, so all squares have four right angles.

Grade 6: 
CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.6.G.A.3
Draw polygons in the coordinate plane given coordinates for the vertices; use coordinates to find the length of a side joining points with the same first coordinate or the same second coordinate. Apply these techniques in the context of solving real-world and mathematical problems.

Grade 7: 
CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.7.G.A.2
Draw (freehand, with ruler and protractor, and with technology) geometric shapes with given conditions. Focus on constructing triangles from three measures of angles or sides, noticing when the conditions determine a unique triangle, more than one triangle, or no triangle.",

Orca is one of the featured characters on Tickle app. It ignites your imagination of controlling virtual figures like Orca by further create your own unique games. At the same time, you can learn programming concepts while trying to clear the exercises. 

Practice & Exercise
- Program the Orca to swim in a circle once and then follow where your fingers touch the screen. - Program the Orca to swim in a circle forever and move in figure 8.
- Program the Orca to swim along the four edges of the ocean.
- Program the Orca to swim left and right across the ocean.
- Make the Orca swim and spin by shaking and tilting your devices. For example, tilt your device   to the right to make the Orca swim to the right, and make the Orca spin by shaking the device.

What you can learn
- Become familiar with visual programming.
- Understand sequential execution of commands, repetition (forever and repeat loops), and  
conditional (if-else) statement.
- Understand the concepts of Cartesian coordinate system.
- Learn coordinate system with direction (0-360 degrees) and distance.
- Learn event-driven programming concepts.
- Use motion sensors in devices to sense motion events (tilt and shake) to steer the Orca.",2016-tutorial,Grades 2+,/images/tutorials/new/tickle_orca.jpg,2016-tutorial,,"English, Chinese (Traditional), Danish, French, Japanese","zh-CN,da,en,fr,ja",tickleo,"all,2-5,6-8,9+",Grades 2+,beginner,beginner,lesson-plan,math,"computers,ios,no-internet","All modern browsers, iPad, iPhone",,few-hours,blocks,Blocks,,

Parrot drone, compatible with the Tickle app, is well-known for their excellent flying performance. Using Tickle app, you can make them fly in innovative ways and perform fabulous air shows. At the same time, you can learn programming concepts while while trying to reach the goal. 
(Devices needed: Rolling Spider/Airborne Night Airborne Cargo) 

Practice & Exercise 
- Program a drone to take off, flip multiple times, and land.
- Make a drone fly forward at a particular speed for a specified duration to a target, and then move  
backwards to the point where it started.
- Program a Parrot Drone to fly along a square and a triangular route, by turning to specific heading  
angles and flying.
- Use the motion sensors on your device and program routes to pilot a drone. For example, program  
the drone to fly right when your device is tilted right, fly forward when being tilted likewise.   When you shake your device, the drone can then perform a flip in mid air!
 
What you can learn
- Become familiar with visual programming.
- Learn the coding concept ""loop"": a control statement for specifying iteration which allows code to  
be run repeatedly.
- Learn two related physics concepts: 1) Linear relationship between speed, time, and distance; 2)
Velocity, a vector describing speed value with a direction.
- Understand heading angles (0 to 360 degrees).
- Learn about the geometry concept ""exterior angles.""
- Understand the programming concept of ""event-driven programming.""",2016-tutorial,Grades 2+,/images/tutorials/new/tickle.png,"2016-tutorial,do-not-show",,"Chinese (Traditional), Danish, English, French, Japanese","zh-CN,da,en,fr,ja",ticklep,"all,do-not-show",do-not-show,do-not-show,do-not-show,do-not-show,do-not-show,do-not-show,do-not-show,do-not-show,do-not-show,do-not-show,do-not-show,do-not-show,

Practice & Exercise
- Program BB-8 to move in a square pattern.
- Program BB-8 to move in a figure-eight pattern.
- Program BB-8 to randomly select a number between 1 and 10, and then guess the number!
- Utilize the tilting sensors of your phones and tablets to pilot BB-8. For example, tilting your  
device forwards will make BB-8 move likewise, and shaking your device will make BB-8   vibrate.

What you can learn
- Become familiar with visual programming. 
- Program BB-8 to perform actions using basic motion commands. 
- Learn the usage of repeating blocks, or loops, which allows code to run multiple times  
consecutively.
- Become familiar with mathematics in programming.
- Learn how to create variables in programming.

Move, spin and give it a few rounds of good turns. Just put some code blocks together on Tickle app to run your Sphero as you want it to.","What you can achieve
Sphero is well-known for its flexibility when applied to teaching. Using Tickle app, it can further be introduced into programming education, while we can simply drag and drop code blocks to create commands for Sphero to perform. Move, spin, jump or even pilot its way when you control your device. At the same time, you can learn programming concepts while trying to clear the exercises. (Devices needed: Sphero) 

Practice & Exercise
- Program a Sphero to move in a square pattern.
- Program a Sphero to spin, and then move in a triangle pattern.
- Program a Sphero to perform actions when it collides with objects and when the device is shaken. - Utilize the tilting sensors of devices to pilot the Sphero. For example, tilting your device 
backwards will make the Sphero move towards you, and shaking your device will make the  
Sphero jump!   
 
What you can learn
- Become familiar with visual programming.
- Learn the coding concept ""loop"": a control statement for specifying iteration which allows code to  
be run repeatedly.
- Use repeat loops to move in the same pattern with fewer code blocks.
- Program a Sphero by combining motion and turning blocks to properly move in a triangle pattern. - Understand the programming concept of ""event-driven programming.""",2016-tutorial,Grades 2+,/images/tutorials/new/tickle_sphero.jpg,2016-tutorial,,Multiple,"zh-CN,da,nl,en,fr,ja",tickles,"all,2-5,6-8,9+",Grades 2+,"comfortable,experienced",beginner,robotics,math,ios,"iPad, iPhone, Sphero robot",Sphero robot,few-hours,blocks,Blocks,"CCSS-Math, NGSS, CSTA",
