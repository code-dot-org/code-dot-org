  codea_beyond_longdescription: Codea for iPad lets you create games and simulations
    &mdash; or just about any visual idea you have. Turn your thoughts into interactive
    creations that make use of iPad features like Multi-Touch and the accelerometer.
    We think Codea is the most beautiful code editor you'll use, and it's easy. Codea
    is designed to let you touch your code. Want to change a number? Just tap and
    drag it. How about a colour, or an image? Tapping will bring up visual editors
    that let you choose exactly what you want.
