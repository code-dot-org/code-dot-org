Joanna Shields,"OBE Chairman, Tech City UK and UK Ambassador for Digital Industries","""The way we work, live and experience the world is changing. Digital tools are helping everyone, not just engineers and computer scientists, to create exciting new experiences, products and services. If we want our kids to be more than just passive consumers - if we want them to become a generation of creators and makers - we need to teach them about the building blocks of today's world, and I can't imagine a better way to start than the Hour of Code.” ",/images/people/joanna-shields.jpg,promote
Boris Johnson,Mayor of London,"""I want London to be at the forefront of the technology sector, so it’s vital our youngsters are equipped with the skills they'll need to compete at the very highest levels on the global stage. My London Schools Excellence Fund is supporting a range of projects aimed at raising standards across the capital and I wholeheartedly welcome initiatives like the Hour of Code, which will help even more schoolchildren to get to grips with some of the basics. I urge all London schools to take part on 3 March.""",/images/people/boris-johnson.jpg,promote

Tim Berners Lee,"Inventor, World Wide Web","""I'm so excited to see the launch of Hour of Code in the UK, in this, the Web's 25th birthday year. Learning to code gives you a completely new perspective when you look at a computer. Before, you think of it as an appliance -- like a fridge -- accepting what it can do.  After, you know that you can code that computer to do anything you can imagine it doing.  That's a massive change ... and a massive challenge!""",/images/people/tim-berners-lee.jpg,promote
Ian Livingstone,"Founder, Games Workshop","""Our world has become exponentially reliant on technology. It is vital that children learn how to become creators, not just consumers of digital technology.  It is the difference between reading and writing. Code powers innovation and creativity. Coding is no longer a marginal skill for geeks. From making games, to fighting cybercrime, to designing a jet propulsion engine, computing is essential knowledge. Learning to code will enable children to become problem-solvers and digital-makers for jobs that don’t yet exist.""",/images/people/ian-livingstone.jpg,promote
Richard Branson,"Founder, Virgin Group","“Whether we're fighting climate change or going to space, everything is moved forward by computers, and we don't have enough people who can code. Teaching young people to code early on can help build skills and confidence and energize the classroom with learning-by-doing opportunities. I learned how to fly a hot air balloon when I was 30,000 feet up and my life was in the balance: you can learn skills at any age but why wait when we can teach everyone to code now!“",/images/people/richard-branson.jpg,promote
Sherry Coutu,"CBE Chairman, Founders4Schools","""Our progress can be charted through people wanting to create a better future and feeling empowered to do so.  In the past that was fuelled by learning to read and write and add things up - whether at school, the home or both. Nowadays, we will need to understand basic problem solving that comes from understanding coding and how it works. The hour of code is an important mission to help everyone who would like to understand more about how the tech behind our modern lives works and to understand how it can help them achieve greater impact.  I sometimes describe it to my kids as giving us 'magical powers', which I think we can all use.”",/images/people/sherry-coutu.jpg,promote

Ashton Kutcher,Actor,"“I'd like to advocate for computer coding to be an institution in the public school systems right next to biology, chemistry, physics, etc. If we want to spur job growth in the US we have to educate ourselves in the disciplines where jobs are available and where economic growth is feasible.“",/images/people/ashton-kutcher.jpg,promote
