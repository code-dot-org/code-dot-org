Devices
-People use computing devices to perform a variety of tasks accurately and
quickly. Computing devices interpret and follow the instructions they are
given literally.
Algorithms
-People follow and create processes as part of daily life. Many of these
processes can be expressed as algorithms that computers can follow.
Variables
-Information in the real world can be represented in computer programs.
Programs store and manipulate data, such as numbers, words, colors, and
images. The type of data determines the actions and attributes associated
with it. 
Modularity
-Complex tasks can be broken down into simpler instructions, some of which
can be broken down even further. Likewise, instructions can be combined to
accomplish complex tasks.
Control
-Computers follow precise sequences of instructions that automate tasks.
Program execution can also be nonsequential by repeating patterns of
instructions and using events to initiate instructions.

Students in K-5 apply reading standards to a range of text types including technical texts and following directions.

Computing Practice & Programming (CPP): 5. Implement problem solutions using a programming language, including: looping behavior, conditional statements, logic, expressions, variables, and functions.


Common Core Math: 
CCSS.MATH.PRACTICE.MP1 Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.

Grade 1: 
CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.1.G.A.2
Compose two-dimensional shapes (rectangles, squares, trapezoids, triangles, half-circles, and quarter-circles) or three-dimensional shapes (cubes, right rectangular prisms, right circular cones, and right circular cylinders) to create a composite shape, and compose new shapes from the composite shape.

Grade 2: 
CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.2.G.A.1
Recognize and draw shapes having specified attributes, such as a given number of angles or a given number of equal faces.1 Identify triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons, hexagons, and cubes.

Grade 3: 
CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.3.G.A.1
Understand that shapes in different categories (e.g., rhombuses, rectangles, and others) may share attributes (e.g., having four sides), and that the shared attributes can define a larger category (e.g., quadrilaterals). Recognize rhombuses, rectangles, and squares as examples of quadrilaterals, and draw examples of quadrilaterals that do not belong to any of these subcategories.

Grade 4: 
CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.4.G.A.1
Draw points, lines, line segments, rays, angles (right, acute, obtuse), and perpendicular and parallel lines. Identify these in two-dimensional figures.

CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.4.G.A.3
Recognize a line of symmetry for a two-dimensional figure as a line across the figure such that the figure can be folded along the line into matching parts. Identify line-symmetric figures and draw lines of symmetry.

Grade 5: 
CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.5.G.A.2
Represent real world and mathematical problems by graphing points in the first quadrant of the coordinate plane, and interpret coordinate values of points in the context of the situation.

CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.5.G.B.3
Understand that attributes belonging to a category of two-dimensional figures also belong to all subcategories of that category. For example, all rectangles have four right angles and squares are rectangles, so all squares have four right angles.

Grade 6: 
CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.6.G.A.3
Draw polygons in the coordinate plane given coordinates for the vertices; use coordinates to find the length of a side joining points with the same first coordinate or the same second coordinate. Apply these techniques in the context of solving real-world and mathematical problems.

Grade 7: 
CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.7.G.A.2
Draw (freehand, with ruler and protractor, and with technology) geometric shapes with given conditions. Focus on constructing triangles from three measures of angles or sides, noticing when the conditions determine a unique triangle, more than one triangle, or no triangle.",93,999,50,80,88

Use strategies such as counting on; making ten (e.g., 8 + 6 = 8 + 2 + 4 = 10 + 4 = 14); decomposing a number leading to a ten (e.g., 13 – 4 = 13 – 3 – 1 = 10 – 1 = 9); using the relationship between addition and subtraction (e.g., knowing that 8 + 4 = 12, one knows 12 – 8 = 4); and creating equivalent but easier or known sums (e.g., adding 6 + 7 by creating the known equivalent 6 + 6 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13). 1.G.A.1 - Distinguish between defining attributes (e.g., triangles are closed and three-sided) versus non-defining attributes (e.g., color, orientation, overall size); build and draw shapes to possess defining attributes. Grade 2: NBT.A.4 - Compare two three-digit numbers based on meanings of the hundreds, tens, and ones digits, using >, =, and < symbols to record the results of comparisons. 2.NBT.A.1 - Understand that the three digits of a three-digit number represent amounts of hundreds, tens, and ones. 2.MD.A.1 - Measure the length of an object by selecting and using appropriate tools such as rulers, yardsticks, meter sticks, and measuring tapes. 2.OA.A.1 - Use addition and subtraction within 100 to solve one- and two-step word problems involving situations of adding to, taking from, putting together, taking apart, and comparing, with unknowns in all positions 2.G.A.1 - Recognize and draw shapes having specified attributes, such as a given number of angles or a given number of equal faces. Identify triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons, hexagons, and cubes. Grade 3: 3.NF.A.3.D - Compare two fractions with the same numerator or the same denominator by reasoning about their size. Recognize that comparisons are valid only when the two fractions refer to the same whole. Record the results of comparisons with the symbols >, =, or <, and justify the conclusions, e.g., by using a visual fraction model. 3.NF.A.3 - Explain equivalence of fractions in special cases, and compare fractions by reasoning about their size. 3.MD.B.4 - Generate measurement data by measuring lengths using rulers marked with halves and fourths of an inch. Show the data by making a line plot, where the horizontal scale is marked off in appropriate units— whole numbers, halves, or quarters. 3.NF.A.3 - Explain equivalence of fractions in special cases, and compare fractions by reasoning about their size. 3.G.A.1 - Understand that shapes in different categories (e.g., rhombuses, rectangles, and others) may share attributes (e.g., having four sides), and that the shared attributes can define a larger category (e.g., quadrilaterals). Recognize rhombuses, rectangles, and squares as examples of quadrilaterals, and draw examples of quadrilaterals that do not belong to any of these subcategories. Grade 4: 4.NF.A.2 - Compare two fractions with different numerators and different denominators, e.g., by creating common denominators or numerators, or by comparing to a benchmark fraction such as 1/2. Recognize that comparisons are valid only when the two fractions refer to the same whole. Record the results of comparisons with symbols >, =, or <, and justify the conclusions. 4.NBT.B.4/​5 - Fluently add and subtract multi-digit whole numbers using the standard algorithm. 4.G.A.2 - Classify two-dimensional figures based on the presence or absence of parallel or perpendicular lines, or the presence or absence of angles of a specified size. Recognize right triangles as a category, and identify right triangles. Grade 5: 5.NBT.A.3 - Read, write, and compare decimals to thousandths. 5.MD.B.2 - Make a line plot to display a data set of measurements in fractions of a unit (1/2, 1/4, 1/8). Use operations on fractions for this grade to solve problems involving information presented in line plots. 5.NBT.B.7 - Add, subtract, multiply, and divide decimals to hundredths, using concrete models or drawings and strategies based on place value, properties of operations, and/or the relationship between addition and subtraction; relate the strategy to a written method and explain the reasoning used. 5.G.B.3 - Understand that attributes belonging to a category of two-dimensional figures also belong to all subcategories of that category. For example, all rectangles have four right angles and squares are rectangles, so all squares have four right angles.",204,82,128,237,227

Move, spin and give it a few rounds of good turns. Just put some code blocks together on Tickle app to run your Sphero as you want it to.","What you can achieve
Sphero is well-known for its flexibility when applied to teaching. Using Tickle app, it can further be introduced into programming education, while we can simply drag and drop code blocks to create commands for Sphero to perform. Move, spin, jump or even pilot its way when you control your device. At the same time, you can learn programming concepts while trying to clear the exercises. (Devices needed: Sphero) 

Practice & Exercise
- Program a Sphero to move in a square pattern.
- Program a Sphero to spin, and then move in a triangle pattern.
- Program a Sphero to perform actions when it collides with objects and when the device is shaken. - Utilize the tilting sensors of devices to pilot the Sphero. For example, tilting your device 
backwards will make the Sphero move towards you, and shaking your device will make the  
Sphero jump!   
 
What you can learn
- Become familiar with visual programming.
- Learn the coding concept ""loop"": a control statement for specifying iteration which allows code to  
be run repeatedly.
- Use repeat loops to move in the same pattern with fewer code blocks.
- Program a Sphero by combining motion and turning blocks to properly move in a triangle pattern. - Understand the programming concept of ""event-driven programming.""",2016-tutorial,Grades 2+,/images/tutorials/new/tickle_sphero.jpg,2016-tutorial,,Multiple,"zh-CN,da,nl,en,fr,ja",tickles,"all,2-5,6-8,9+",Grades 2+,"comfortable,experienced",beginner,robotics,math,ios,"iPad, iPhone, Sphero robot",Sphero robot,few-hours,blocks,Blocks,"CCSS-Math, NGSS, CSTA",420,999,267,360,999

Parrot drone, compatible with the Tickle app, is well-known for their excellent flying performance. Using Tickle app, you can make them fly in innovative ways and perform fabulous air shows. At the same time, you can learn programming concepts while while trying to reach the goal. 
(Devices needed: Rolling Spider/Airborne Night Airborne Cargo) 

Practice & Exercise 
- Program a drone to take off, flip multiple times, and land.
- Make a drone fly forward at a particular speed for a specified duration to a target, and then move  
backwards to the point where it started.
- Program a Parrot Drone to fly along a square and a triangular route, by turning to specific heading  
angles and flying.
- Use the motion sensors on your device and program routes to pilot a drone. For example, program  
the drone to fly right when your device is tilted right, fly forward when being tilted likewise.   When you shake your device, the drone can then perform a flip in mid air!
 
What you can learn
- Become familiar with visual programming.
- Learn the coding concept ""loop"": a control statement for specifying iteration which allows code to  
be run repeatedly.
- Learn two related physics concepts: 1) Linear relationship between speed, time, and distance; 2)
Velocity, a vector describing speed value with a direction.
- Understand heading angles (0 to 360 degrees).
- Learn about the geometry concept ""exterior angles.""
- Understand the programming concept of ""event-driven programming.""",2016-tutorial,Grades 2+,/images/tutorials/new/tickle.png,"2016-tutorial,do-not-show",,"Chinese (Traditional), Danish, English, French, Japanese","zh-CN,da,en,fr,ja",ticklep,"all,do-not-show",do-not-show,do-not-show,do-not-show,do-not-show,do-not-show,do-not-show,do-not-show,do-not-show,do-not-show,do-not-show,do-not-show,do-not-show,999,999,999,999,999
