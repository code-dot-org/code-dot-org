Her first experience with coding was being thrown into HTML when web pages first became a ""thing"", thinking why would any normal everyday person need to know how to code and program? She says she’s glad to know she was wrong! She is passionate about learning and sharing with others! ",hoc_review

She has experience using Code.org, Kodable, Tynker, Scratch Jr., Robot Turtles, Bits & Bytes, Sphero robot, and Dash and Dot. When Rebecca isn’t teaching, she’s golfing. Rebecca was doing web 2.0 tools with her classes when she found an article on coding. It was June and the kids were looking for something new, so she and her students in grades 1-5 explored and played. Kids loved it, teachers loved it, parents loved it—they were hooked through the next year. The funniest CS question a student has ever asked: One day, her 2nd grade class was Skyping with someone who helped design the Sphero Robot, and her students asked: “you make a lot of money right, what kind of car do you drive?” She says it was hilarious and mortifying!",hoc_review
