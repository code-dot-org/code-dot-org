It was June and the kids were looking for something new, so she and her students in grades 1-5 explored and played. Kids loved it, teachers loved it, parents loved it—they were hooked through the next year. The funniest CS question a student has ever asked: One day, her 2nd grade class was Skyping with someone who helped design the Sphero Robot, and her students asked: “you make a lot of money right, what kind of car do you drive?” She says it was hilarious and mortifying!",hoc_review
