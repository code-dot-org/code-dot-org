# Sync folders configuration
synced_folders:
  # vboxsf - native VirtualBox method, cross-platform, convenient and reliable, terribly slow
  # nfs: better performance and convenience on Mac
  # nfs2: optimized nfs settings, experimental (default on Mac)
  # smb: better performance and convenience on Windows. Requires Vagrant to be run with admin privileges (not recommended).
  # smb2: does not require running vagrant as admin (default on Windows).
  # rsync: best performance, cross-platform platform, one-way only
  #   Run `vagrant rsync-auto` to start auto sync.
  #   When using rsync sync type the "rsync_folders" list below is mandatory.
  # vboxsf: best compatibility and ease of setup, but poor performance.
  # default: defaults to nfs2 on Mac and smb2 on Windows.
  # '': disable synced folders. Useful in case you want to use 'individual_mounts' option below.

  # smb_user, smb_password - The username and password used for authentication to mount the SMB mount.

  # List of folders to sync with rsync. These should be subfolder names within the <Projects> folder (e.g. "drupal7")
