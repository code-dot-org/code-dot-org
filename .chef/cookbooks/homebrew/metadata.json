{"name":"homebrew","version":"2.1.0","description":"Install Homebrew, and use it as the OS X package provider on Chef versions =< 11","long_description":"# Homebrew Cookbook\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/homebrew.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/homebrew) [![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/homebrew.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/homebrew)\n\nThis cookbook installs [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) and under Chef 11 and earlier versions, its package provider replaces MacPorts as the _default package provider_ for the package resource on OS X systems.\n\n# Requirements\nChef 12: The package provider is not necessary on Chef 12, as the default [OS X package provider](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc016-homebrew-osx-package-provider.md) is homebrew.\n\nChef <= 11: The package provider will be set as the default provider for OS X.\n\n## Prerequisites\nIn order for this recipe to work, your userid must own `/usr/local`. This is outside the scope of the cookbook because it's possible that you'll run the cookbook as your own user, not root and you'd have to be root to take ownership of the directory. Easiest way to get started:\n\n```bash\nsudo chown -R `whoami`:staff /usr/local\n```\n\nBear in mind that this will take ownership of the entire folder and its contents, so if you've already got stuff in there (eg MySQL owned by a `mysql` user) you'll need to be a touch more careful. This is a recommendation from the Homebrew project.\n\n**Note** This cookbook _only_ supports installing in `/usr/local`. While the Homebrew project itself allows for alternative installations, this cookbook doesn't.\n\n## Platform\n- Mac OS X (10.6+)\n\nThe only platform supported by Homebrew itself at the time of this writing is Mac OS X. It should work fine on Server edition as well, and on platforms that Homebrew supports in the future.\n\n## Cookbooks\n- build-essential: homebrew itself doesn't work well if XCode is not installed.\n\n# Attributes\n- `node['homebrew']['owner']` - The user that will own the Homebrew installation and packages. Setting this will override the default behavior which is to use the non-privileged user that has invoked the Chef run (or the `SUDO_USER` if invoked with sudo). The default is `nil`.\n- `node['homebrew']['auto-update']` - Whether the default recipe should automatically update homebrew each run or not. The default is `true` to maintain compatibility. Set to false or nil to disable. Note that disabling this feature may cause formula to not work.\n- `node['homebrew']['formulas']` - An Array of formula that should be installed using homebrew by default, used only in the `homebrew::install_formulas` recipe.\n  - To install the most recent version, include just the recipe name: `- simple_formula`\n  - To install a specific version, specify both its name and version:\n\n    ```\n    - name: special-version-formula\n      version: 1.2.3\n    ```\n\n  - To install the HEAD of a formula, specify both its name and `head: true`:\n\n    ```\n    - name: head-tracking-formula\n      head: true\n    ```\n\n- `node['homebrew']['casks']` - An Array of casks that should be installed using brew cask by default, used only in the `homebrew::install_casks` recipe.\n- `node['homebrew']['taps']` - An Array of taps that should be installed using brew tap by default, used only in the `homebrew::install_taps` recipe.\n\n# Resources and Providers\nThis cookbook includes a package resource provider to use homebrew. Under Chef 12+, this is not necessary, and the code doesn't actually get used on Chef 12+. This was preserved to maintain backwards compatiblity with older versions of Chef.\n\n## package / homebrew\\_package\nThis cookbook provides a package provider called `homebrew_package` which will install/remove packages using Homebrew. This becomes the default provider for `package` if your platform is Mac OS X.\n\nAs this extends the built-in package resource/provider in Chef, it has all the resource attributes and actions available to the package resource. However, a couple notes:\n- Homebrew itself doesn't have a notion of \"upgrade\" per se. The \"upgrade\" action will simply perform an install, and if the Homebrew Formula for the package is newer, it will upgrade.\n- Likewise, Homebrew doesn't have a purge, but the \"purge\" action will act like \"remove\".\n\n### Examples\n\n```ruby\npackage 'mysql' do\n  action :install\nend\n\nhomebrew_package 'mysql'\n\npackage 'mysql' do\n  provider Chef::Provider::Package::Homebrew\nend\n\npackage 'wireshark' do\n  options '--with-qt --devel'\nend\n```\n\n### homebrew\\_tap\nLWRP for `brew tap`, a Homebrew command used to add additional formula repositories. From the `brew` man page:\n\n```text\ntap [tap]\n       Tap a new formula repository from GitHub, or list existing taps.\n\n       tap is of the form user/repo, e.g. brew tap homebrew/dupes.\n```\n\nDefault action is `:tap` which enables the repository. Use `:untap` to disable a tapped repository.\n\n#### Examples\n\n```ruby\nhomebrew_tap 'homebrew/dupes'\n\nhomebrew_tap 'homebrew/dupes' do\n  action :untap\nend\n```\n\n## homebrew\\_cask\nLWRP for `brew cask`, a Homebrew-style CLI workflow for the administration of Mac applications distributed as binaries. It's implemented as a homebrew \"external command\" called cask.\n\n[homebrew-cask on GitHub](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask)\n\n### Prerequisites\nYou must have the homebrew-cask repository tapped.\n\n```ruby\nhomebrew_tap 'caskroom/cask'\n```\n\nAnd then install the homebrew cask package before using this LWRP.\n\n```ruby\npackage \"brew-cask\" do\n  action :install\n  end\n```\n\nYou can include the `homebrew::cask` recipe to do this.\n\n### Examples\n\n```ruby\nhomebrew_cask \"google-chrome\"\n\nhomebrew_cask \"google-chrome\" do\n  action :uncask\nend\n```\n\nDefault action is `:cask` which installs the Application binary . Use `:uncask` to uninstall a an Application.\n\n[View the list of available Casks](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/tree/master/Casks)\n\n# Usage\nWe strongly recommend that you put \"recipe[homebrew]\" in your node's run list, to ensure that it is available on the system and that Homebrew itself gets installed. Putting an explicit dependency in the metadata will cause the cookbook to be downloaded and the library loaded, thus resulting in changing the package provider on Mac OS X, so if you have systems you want to use the default (Mac Ports), they would be changed to Homebrew.\n\nThe default recipe also ensures that Homebrew is installed and up to date if the auto update attribute (above) is true (default).\n\n# License and Authors\nThis cookbook is maintained by CHEF.
