{"name":"build-essential","version":"2.3.1","description":"Installs C compiler / build tools","long_description":"# build-essential Cookbook\n[![Cookbook Version](http://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/build-essential.svg)][cookbook] [![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/chef-cookbooks/build-essential.svg)][travis]\n\nInstalls packages required for compiling C software from source. Use this cookbook if you wish to compile C programs, or install RubyGems with native extensions.\n\n## Requirements\n### Platforms\n- Debian/Ubuntu\n- RHEL/CentOS/Scientific/Amazon/Oracle\n- openSUSE\n- SmartOS\n- Fedora\n- Mac OS X\n- FreeBSD\n\n### Chef\n- Chef 11+\n\n### Cookbooks\n- Suggests pkgutil for Solaris based platforms\n\n\n**Note for Debian platform family:** On Debian platform-family systems, it is recommended that `apt-get update` be run, to ensure that the package cache is updated. It's not in the scope of this cookbook to do that, as it can [create a duplicate resource](https://tickets.chef.io/browse/CHEF-3694). We recommend using the [apt](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/apt) cookbook to do this.\n\n**Note for OmniOS**: Currently, OmniOS's Ruby package is built with GCC 4.6.3, and the path is hardcoded, as the gcc binaries are not installed in the default $PATH. This means that in order to install RubyGems into the \"system\" Ruby, one must install `developer/gcc46`. [An issue](https://github.com/omniti-labs/omnios-build/issues/19) is open upstream w/ OmniOS to rebuild the Ruby package with GCC 4.7.2.\n\n## Attributes\n\nAttribute                                 | Default                      | Description\n----------------------------------------- | :--------------------------: | ---------------------------------\n`node['build-essential']['compile_time']` | `false`                      | Execute resources at compile time\n`node['build-essential']['msys']['path']` | `#{ENV['SYSTEMDRIVE']\\\\msys` | Destination for msys (Windows only)\n\n## Usage\nInclude the build-essential recipe in your run list:\n\n```sh\nknife node run_list add NODE \"recipe[build-essential::default]\"\n```\n\nor add the build-essential recipe as a dependency and include it from inside another cookbook:\n\n```ruby\ninclude_recipe 'build-essential::default'\n```\n\n### Gems with C extensions\nFor RubyGems that include native C extensions you wish to use with Chef, you should do the following.\n- Set the `compile_time` attribute to true in your wrapper cookbook or role:\n\n  ```ruby\n   # Wrapper attribute\n   default['build-essential']['compile_time'] = true\n  ```\n\n  ```ruby\n   # Role\n   default_attributes(\n     'build-essential' => {\n       'compile_time' => true\n     }\n   )\n  ```\n\n- Ensure that the C libraries, which include files and other assorted \"dev\"\n\n  type packages, are installed in the compile phase after the build-essential\n\n  recipe is executed. For example:\n\n  ```ruby\n   include_recipe 'build-essential::default'\n\n   package('mypackage-devel') { action :nothing }.run_action(:install)\n  ```\n\n- Use the `chef_gem` resource in your recipe to install the gem with the native\n\n  extension:\n\n  ```ruby\n   chef_gem 'gem-with-native-extension'\n  ```\n\n## License & Authors\n**Author:** Cookbook Engineering Team ([cookbooks@chef.io](mailto:cookbooks@chef.io))\n\n**Copyright:** 2009-2015, Chef Software, Inc.\n\n```\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```\n\n[cookbook]: https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/build-essential\n[travis]: http://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/build-essential\n","maintainer":"Chef Software, Inc.","maintainer_email":"cookbooks@chef.io","license":"Apache 2.0","platforms":{"amazon":">= 0.0.0","centos":">= 0.0.0","debian":">= 0.0.0","fedora":">= 0.0.0","freebsd":">= 0.0.0","mac_os_x":">= 10.7.0","mac_os_x_server":">= 10.7.0","oracle":">= 0.0.0","redhat":">= 0.0.0","scientific":">= 0.0.0","smartos":">= 0.0.0","suse":">= 0.0.0","ubuntu":">= 0.0.0","windows":">= 0.0.0"},"dependencies":{"7-zip":">= 0.0.0"},"recommendations":{},"suggestions":{"pkgutil":">= 0.0.0"},"conflicting":{},"providing":{},"replacing":{},"attributes":{},"groupings":{},"recipes":{"build-essential":"Installs packages required for compiling C software from source."}}
