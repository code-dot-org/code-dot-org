Key Concept,Extensive Evidence,Convincing Evidence,Limited Evidence,No Evidence
Multiple Sprites,"You used multiple sprites, with multiple properties updated in the draw loop","You used multiple sprites, each with at least one property updated inside the draw loop","You used at least one sprite, with at least one property updated after sprite creation.","You did not use any sprites, or no sprite properties are updated after the sprite is created."
User Input,Your program responds to multiple types of user input and uses at least one random number,Your program responds to user input and uses at least one random number,Your program uses a random number or responds to a user input.,Your program does not use random numbers or respond to user input.
Program Sequence,Your program is well sequenced and properly separates code in and out of the draw loop.,Your program correctly separates code in and out of the draw loop to create animation. Your program may contain some incorrectly sequenced code.,"Your program is animated through the draw loop, but some code is improperly placed in or out of the loop.",Your draw loop is not used to create animation
Conditionals and Variables,"Your program uses multiple conditionals inside the draw loop, at least one of which is triggered by a variable or sprite property",Your program uses a conditional that is triggered by a variable or sprite property inside the draw loop.,Your program uses at least one conditional inside the draw loop.,Your program uses no conditionals.
Position and Movement,"Multiple elements are placed on the screen using the coordinate system, and move in different ways.",At least one element is placed on the screen using the coordinate system and moves during the program.,At least one element is placed on the screen using the coordinate system.,No elements (sprites or shapes) are placed on the screen using the coordinate system.
Variables,Multiple variables are used and their values are updated during your program. At least one variable or property uses the counter pattern.,"At least one variable is used, and its value is updated during the program.",At least one variable is used in your program.,No variables are used in your program
