# This script will terminate all drone agents that are in 'error' state. This
# happens occasionally, and we have not been able to pin down the exact reason
# why. This was created when we were using the following versions, and may not
# be needed if future bugfixes resolve this issue.
#
# - drone/autoscaler:1.8.2
# - drone/drone:1.9.0
#
# If it's too fancy for you, you can always run the following command.
#
# ```
# drone server ls -l | grep error | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -tL1 drone server destroy`
# ```
#
# Potential upgrades:
# - gather count metrics regularly and publish to CloudWatch
# - publish execution events to Slack
# - convert to a Rake task for consistency
