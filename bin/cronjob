# CRONJOB is a wrapper around our scheduled (cron) tasks intended to capture and notify when jobs
# encounter unexpected conditions. CRONJOB uses a combination of exit code and command output to
# determine whether and how to notify.
#
# SUCCESS (no notifications): The process exited with a 0 exit code with no output (after
#   stripping whitespace).
#
# WARNING (email notification): The process exited with a non-0 exit code
#   or returned output.
#
# ERROR (not currently differentiated): A non-0 exit code could be elevated to mean error and
#   result in a red HipChat message and/or channel notification.
#
# CRONJOBs are defined the cdo-apps::crontab Chef recipe: `chef/cookbooks/cdo-apps/recipes/crontab.rb`.

# email_notify - deliver an email notification if appropriate. the method requires sendmail to
#   be working. This is currently handled by installing the `cdo-postfix` recipe. This function
#   could be changed to use the Poste mail system but my gut says this is a bad idea because it
#   mixes our internal notifications with our customer notifications, and Poste keeps copies of
#   all data sent, usually little bits of JSON applied to the template, but in this case jobs
#   (e.g. build!) output large logs.
