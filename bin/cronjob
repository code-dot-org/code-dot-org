# CRONJOB is a wrapper around our scheduled (cron) tasks intended to capture and notify when jobs
# encounter unexpected conditions. CRONJOB uses a combination of exit code and command output to
# determine whether and how to notify.
#
# SUCCESS (no notifications): The process exited with a 0 exit code with no output (after
#   stripping whitespace).
#
# WARNING (email notification, HipChat yellow message): The process exited with a non-0 exit code
#   or returned output.
#
# ERRROR (not currently differentiated): A non-0 exit code could be elevated to mean error and
#   result in a red HipChat message and/or channel notification.
#
# FUTURE THOUGHTS: It may make sense to deliver WARNING and ERROR cases to HoneyBadger.io in
#   addition to (or instead of) HipChat.
#
# PROPER LOCATION: This script should move to `/bin`. It's presence in `/aws` is an artifact of
#   the time prior to using Chef.
#
# CRONJOBs are defined the crontab: `chef/cookbooks/cdo-apps/templates/default/crontab.erb`.

# email_notify - deliver an email notification if appropriate. the method requires sendmail to

#   could be changed to use the Poste mail system but my gut says this is a bad idea because it
#   mixes our internal notifications with our customer notifications, and Poste keeps copies of
#   all data sent, usually little bits of JSON applied to the template, but in this case jobs
#   (e.g. build!) output large logs.
