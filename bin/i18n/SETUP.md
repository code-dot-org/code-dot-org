# I18n Sync Setup

These scripts all require [the Crowdin CLI tool][1] version 2.0.17. Follow the
instructions there to install for your system.

You will additionally need to add a `crowdin_credentials.yml` file to this
directory (`{project root}/bin/i18n/`) containing the API key for the project.
See [the crowdin documentation][2] for more details; the API key itself can be
found on the project settings page
