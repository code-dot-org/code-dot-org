# I18n Sync Setup

These scripts all require [the Crowdin CLI tool][1] version 2.0.17. Follow the
instructions there to install for your system.

These scripts also require some dependencies to be installed using NPM. Run the
following command while in this directory
```
npm install
```

You will additionally need to add a `codeorg_credentials.yml` file to this
directory (`{project root}/bin/i18n/`) containing the API key for the code.org
project, an `hourofcode_credentials.yml` file containing the API key for the
Hour of Code project, and a `codeorg_markdown_credentials.yml` file containing
the API key for the Code.org - Markdown project.  See [the crowdin documentation][2]
for more details; the API keys themselves can be found on the project settings page
