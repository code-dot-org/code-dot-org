# This script performs a non-interactive full OS upgrade for our Ubuntu front-ends. The combination
# of flags prevent prompting and, when choices need to be made, choose to preserve our existing
# configuration files over replacements from the system.
#
# Here's how you'd upgrade our instances:
#  ssh staging.code.org "sudo staging/bin/aptitude-full-upgrade"
#  ssh test.code.org "sudo test/bin/aptitude-full-upgrade"
#  ssh console.code.org "sudo production/bin/aptitude-full-upgrade"
#  ssh daemon.code.org "sudo production/bin/aptitude-full-upgrade"
#  ssh <dns name of a front-end> "sudo production/bin/aptitude-full-upgrade"
#
