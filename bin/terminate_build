# Terminates a build being executed by aws/ci_build (our polling-based continuous deployment system) by killing
# the parent process and all of its child processes. The build process carries out many different types of activities
# and invokes long running operations on external systems (such as the relational database and various AWS services).
# While each build task is typically capable of being executed again successfully after being terminated abruptly,
# this script may leave some build components/tasks in an unstable state.

# Execute a system command. Raise an error if the command does not complete successfully. Log the output
# and also return the output to the caller.
