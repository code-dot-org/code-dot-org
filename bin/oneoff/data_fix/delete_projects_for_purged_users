# Delete Project S3 Objects created by Users whose accounts were purged if Project data is restored from offsite backup.
# Student project S3 Objects are irrevocably deleted by the Account Purger (28 days after the user's account is
# soft deleted). But, S3 Bucket Replication (used to backup project buckets to offsite account for disaster recovery)
# intentionally does not propagate Object deletion to the backup to prevent malicious deletions from propagating to the
# backup. In the unlikely recovery scenario that the projects system is restored from the offsite backup, use this script
# to delete S3 Objects for projects belonging to purged users.
