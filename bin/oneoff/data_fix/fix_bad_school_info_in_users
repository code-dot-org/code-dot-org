# Script to update the school_info_id in users that may be bad.
#
# What we discovered, is in the SchoolInfoDeduplicator the filter criteria
# wasn't specific enough and in cases where some users did not specify an
# actual school, they may have been matched to a specific school.
#
# For instance, in production, a user specifying only the country and
# school_type, the following query would be generated to match an existing
# school_info:
#
#   SELECT * FROM school_infos
#   WHERE country = 'US' AND school_type = 'public' AND validation_type = 'none'
#   ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 1
#
# However, because of the order on id, it was matching a school in NJ.
