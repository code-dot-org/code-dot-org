# This script is used to find and delete level-specific custom blocks that also
# exist in the block pool.
#
# Usage: ./block_deletion.rb
# Typically you would want to run this script directly on levelbuilder. Be sure
# to commit content first in case something goes wrong.
#
# It will run through all the blocks in the block pool, and compare them against
# all level-specific blocks. The level-specific block will be removed if it's
# exactly the same as the block pool block, or if the level it's in is not used
# in any script, nor is it the 'New Sprite Lab Project' level. Otherwise, the
# script will display a diff and prompt you to keep or delete the level-specific
# block.
