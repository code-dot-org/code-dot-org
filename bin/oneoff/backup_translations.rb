# This script's function is to move translation JSON files from our
# i18n directory into a backup directory in the root of our repo.
# The files are not meant to be kept there long term. They should
# eventually be deleted.

# The reason why this was originally used is in the case that a `Script`
# no longer existed and caused the i18n sync-out step to fail with a
# `RuntimeError: Do not call Script.get_from_cache with a family_name`
# error. Just one of the reasons this could be the case is that the
# `Script` was renamed or deleted.
