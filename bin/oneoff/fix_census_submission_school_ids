# This script is to fix the bad data created when we accidentally stopped copying the
# nces school id into the census form on the HoC signup page. That bug was fixed in
# https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org/pull/19251
# The result was many census_submissions that were incorrectly associated with
# the same school_info, namely the one with just the country set to US.
# Luckily the submitters name and email were still propogated correctly. We can use
# that data to match to the Hoc Signup form submission in the pegsus FORMS table.
# If we find a unique school id there then we can associate it with the census submission.
