# This script sets EmailPreference.opt_in to false for any person who submitted a Pegasus Petition form and was less
# than 16 years old when they submitted the form because GDPR requires someone to be at least 16 to consent to opt in.
# Before mid-May 2018, the Petition form anonymized email addresses submitted by people younger than 13.  Starting in
# mid-May 2018 the Petition form anonymizes email addresses submitted by anyone under 16.  This script does not
# anonymize or delete email addresses submitted by Petitioners who were between the ages of 13 and 16 because
# our Contact Rollups process does not currently have any functionality to delete emails from Pardot that were deleted
# in our database, but it does comply with GDPR by opting out those email addresses.
