# This script reads a file of teacher email addresses (one per line). For each,
# it  checks to see if there is a user account without a plaintext email
# matching the email address (comparing the hashes). If there is, it upgrades
# the (likely student) account to a teacher account, populating the plaintext
# email field with the email address.
#
# This is being done to alleviate account issues impacting the PLC team.
#
# Note that this script assumes a list of email addresses within the file
# /tmp/teacher_emails.csv. Since this file contains PII, it will live only
# temporarily (also not within source control) at that location.
