# This script wipes plaintext emails associated with students, filling them with
# empty strings, as part of an effort to reduce our PII footprint.
#
# As of 2016-05-25, there were over 3.1M such emails.
#
# This is being done as a one-off script so as to be able to control the timing
# and length of its execution (via start_index and end_index) in production,
# followed by a migration performing the same task so as to assure all
# environments incorporate this.
