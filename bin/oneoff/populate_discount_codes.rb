# 1 row for each entry, where a row contains a prefix column and a code column
# The full code is prefix + code

# Begin debug helper methods

# What follows is a set of helper methods for discount code functionality that
# can be copy/pasted into the console. They are designed to be used in non-prod
# environments
#####

# This method is not used directly in this script, but can be used to populate
# the db with fake discount codes. Usage looks something like:
# populate_fake_data(10, false, Date.new(2018, 12, 31))
# @param {boolean} full_discount - Is this a full or partial discount?
# @param {number} n - How many entries to create
def populate_fake_data(n, full_discount, expiration)
  n.times do
    # Create a bogus code
    prefix = full_discount ? 'FAKE0_' : 'FAKE100_'
    code = SecureRandom.hex(7)
    CircuitPlaygroundDiscountCode.create!(
      code: prefix + code,
      full_discount: full_discount,
      expiration: expiration
    )
  end
end

# This method is not used directly in this script, but can be used to add a teacher
# to a CSD cohort, so that they will be considered PD eligible for discount codes.
# Because this is modifying the cohort, it should not be run on prod (or if it is,
# you need to be sure to clean up after yourself).
def set_user_pd_eligible(teacher)
  teacher.cohorts << Cohort.find_or_create_by('CSD-TeacherConHouston')
end

# This method is not used directly in this script, but can be used to create a
# fake section for a teacher that causes our teacher to meet eligibility requirements
# i.e. 10+ students with progress in 5+ levels in csd2 and csd3
# Because it will create fake data, it should not be run on prod (or if it is,
# you need to be sure to clean up after yourself).
