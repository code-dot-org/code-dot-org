# This script adds a row to the user_permissions table with permission type
# 'levelbuilder' for all admin users. The intent is for this script to be run
# in the levelbuilder environment so that we can break the connection between
# levelbuilder access and admin privileges.
#
# This is being done as a script rather than a migration as it only needs to
# (should) happen in the levelbuilder environment.
