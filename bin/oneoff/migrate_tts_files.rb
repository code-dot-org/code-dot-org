# This script will copy, if necessary, the TTS (Text-To-Speech) mp3 files that we
# store in our cdo-tts bucket from their old locations that were based on a single
# MD5 hash to a new one which uses a more robust SHA-256 hash.
#
# We will do this to prevent the creation of thousands of duplicate recordings in
# the future due to new courses created from older versions of that course causing
# a massive run of TTS generation for the same content.
#
# There were a lot of dangling files that could not be re-mapped since their original
# strings do not seem to exist anymore. These files will not be copied since they
# cannot be rehashed. There is a risk that they will fail to exist, but this process
# in this script should exhaustively look at every single string to determine the
# existence of its TTS file.
#
# Also, there are many missing TTS files. Finding a few, and looking at them on our
# production site shows network errors as our app tries to load the TTS file. Our
# app assumes they exist and they do not, and we have no process for identifying or
# fixing this.
#
# With this in mind, I also want to record alongside the
# <md5-hash>/<sha-hash>/<params>.mp3 a <params>.json file that contains information
# about the provenance of the TTS file which should include:
#   - text (string) -- The text being read by the agent.
#   - key (string) -- The source within the level for the text. (long_instructions, etc)
#   - level (string) -- The name of the level (replacing the old filename)
#
# Unfortunately, it is unclear how we would know that a TTS string was generated
# before in order to clean up the bucket. We could, however, go through every string,
# much like this script does, and find and clean up the dangling files. This script is
# not very complicated and this amount of complexity might be better than any other
# kind of bookkeeping.
