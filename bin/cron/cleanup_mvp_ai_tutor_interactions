# During the pilot/prototyping phase of development for AI Tutor we want to
# avoid storing student chat messages (AiTutorInteractions) any longer than
# is necessary for analysis to prevent storing excess student PII. This deletes
# any AiTutorInteraction older than 30 days. Once AI Tutor is fully launched
# and we have an approved long-term deletion/obfuscation policy we will
# disable this cron job. See: https://codedotorg.atlassian.net/browse/CT-372.
