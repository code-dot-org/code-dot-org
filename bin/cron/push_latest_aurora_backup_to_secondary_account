# This script pushes backup snapshots of our production database into a
# write-only backup account, with the following steps:
#
# 1) Copy the latest automated snapshot to a temporary manual one
# 2) Wait until ready, and share the manual snapshot with the backup acct
# 3) On the backup account, copy the shared snapshot to a manual one
# 4) Wait until ready, and finally go back to the main account and delete the temp snapshot
#
# IAM user credentials for backup account must be present in aws config with profile name 'backup',
# which requires setting appropriate secrets in our Chef config.
