# Build setup

#### Windows note: use an Ubuntu VM

Many Windows developers have found that setting up an Ubuntu virtual machine is less painful than getting Ruby and other prerequisites running on Windows.

* Option A: Use [VMWare Player](https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_player/4_0) and an [Ubuntu 14.04 iso image](http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04.1/ubuntu-14.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso)
* Option B: Use vagrant ([install](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/)):
  1. `vagrant init ubuntu/trusty64`
  1. Configure to use 2048mb rather than 512mb RAM ([instructions](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/virtualbox/configuration.html))
  1. `vagrant up`
  1. `vagrant ssh`
* Option C: Use AWS EC2: [launch Ubuntu 14.04 AMI](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=ap-northeast-1#launchAmi=ami-d9fdddd8)

## Install OS-specific prerequisites

### OS X Mavericks

1. Install Homebrew: `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"`
1. `brew install https://raw.github.com/quantiverge/homebrew-binary/pdftk/pdftk.rb enscript gs mysql imagemagick rbenv ruby-build`
  1. If it complains about an old version of `X`, run `brew unlink X` and run `brew install X` again
1. Set up MySQL
  1. Have launchd start mysql at login: `ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/mysql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents`
  1. Start mysql now: `launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mysql.plist`
1. Set up [RBENV](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv#homebrew-on-mac-os-x) and Ruby 2.0
  1. Add `if which rbenv > /dev/null; then eval "$(rbenv init -)"; fi` to `~/.profile`
  1. source `~/.profile`
  1. rbenv install 2.0.0-p451
  1. rbenv global 2.0.0-p451
  1. rbenv rehash

### Ubuntu 14.04

1. `sudo apt-get install -y aptitude`
1. `sudo aptitude update`
1. `sudo aptitude upgrade`
1. `sudo aptitude install -y git mysql-server mysql-client libmysqlclient-dev libxslt1-dev libssl-dev zlib1g-dev imagemagick libmagickcore-dev libmagickwand-dev nodejs openjdk-7-jre-headless libcairo2-dev libjpeg8-dev libpango1.0-dev libgif-dev curl`
  * **Hit enter and select default options for any configuration popups**
1. `sudo aptitude install npm`
1. `sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node`
1. `sudo npm update -g npm`
1. `sudo npm install -g grunt-cli`

## Common setup

1. `git clone https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org.git`
1. `gem install bundler`
1. `cd code-dot-org/aws`
1. `bundle install`
1. `cd ../dashboard`
1. `bundle install`
1. `bundle exec rake db:create db:schema:load seed:all`
1. `cd ../pegasus`
1. `bundle install`
1. `echo CREATE DATABASE pegasus_development | mysql -uroot`
1. `rake db:migrate`
1. `rake seed:migrate`

## Organizational Structure
Our code is segmented into four parts:

* Blockly Core is the visual programming language platform used for the interactive tutorials.
* Blockly includes apps—blockly puzzles built based on Blockly Core.
    * [Hour of Code](http://studio.code.org/hoc/1)
* Dashboard, is the tutorial platform which organizes blockly levels into tutorials.
    * [Code Studio](http://studio.code.org)
* Pegasus is the main site which also includes the teacher dashboard (support for teachers to track student progress).
    * [code.org](http://code.org)
    * [csedweek.org](http://csedweek.org)
    * [Teacher Dashboard](http://code.org/teacher-dashboard)

## Running Dashboard
1. `cd code-dot-org/dashboard`
2. `bundle exec rails server`
3.  Note: after major code updates (or if something seems broken), run `bundle exec rake db:migrate seed:all`
4.  Visit [http://localhost.studio.code.org:3000/](http://localhost.studio.code.org:3000/)

## Running Pegasus

1. `cd code-dot-org/pegasus`
2. `./up`
3. Note: after major code updates (or if something seems broken), run `rake db:migrate seed:migrate`
4. Visit [http://localhost.code.org:9393/](http://localhost.code.org:9393/)

## Building Blockly and Blockly-core (optional)

The learn.code.org default dashboard install includes a static build of blockly, but if you want to make modifications to blockly or blockly-core:

1. `cd code-dot-org/dashboard`
1. `bundle exec rake 'blockly:dev[../blockly]'`
  * This symlinks to dashboard reference the dev version of blockly
1. Follow the blockly build instructions at `blockly/README` or blockly-core build instructions at `blockly-core/README`

## Submitting Contributions

### Testing your changes

#### Manually

We support recent versions of Firefox, Chrome, IE9, iOS Safari and the Android browsers. Be sure to try your feature out in IE9, iOS and Android if it's a risk. [BrowserStack live](http://www.browserstack.com) or [Sauce Labs manual](https://saucelabs.com/manual) let you run manual tests in these browsers remotely.

#### Unit tests

For dashboard changes, be sure to test your changes using `rake test`. For [blockly](./blockly) changes, see our [grunt testing instructions](./blockly#running-tests).

#### UI tests

Our continuous integration server regularly runs a suite of [UI tests](./dashboard/test/ui) using Selenium / Cucumber which run against many browsers via [BrowserStack Automate](https://www.browserstack.com/automate), and can also be run locally using `chromedriver`. See the [README](./dashboard/test/ui) in that folder for instructions.

If your changes might affect level paths, blockly UI, or critical path site logic, be sure to test your changes with a local UI test.

### Submitting your Pull Request

Contributors should follow the GitHub [fork-and-pull model](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) to submit pull requests into this repository.

1. On your fork, you'll either push to your own finished branch or checkout a new branch for your feature before you start your feature
    - `git checkout -b branch_name`
2. Develop the new feature and push the changes to **your** fork and branch
    - `git add YYY`
    - `git commit -m "ZZZ"`
    - `git push origin branch_name`
3. Go to the code-dot-org GitHub page
    - [https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org](https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org)
4. For your submissinon to be reviewed
    - Click on the "Pull Request" link, look over and confirm your diff
    - Submit a pull request for your branch to be merged into staging
    - For bonus points, include screenshots in the description. Command + Ctrl + Shift + 4 in OS X lets you copy a screen selection to your clipboard, which GitHub will let you paste right into the description
5. After your pull request is merged into staging, you can review your changes on the following sites:
  * [http://staging.code.org/](http://staging.code.org/)
  * [http://staging.studio.code.org/](http://staging.studio.code.org/)
  * [http://staging.csedweek.org/](http://staging.csedweek.org/)
