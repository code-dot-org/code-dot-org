# Blockly 20 Hour Curriculum

Blockly is a web-based, graphical programming editor. Users can drag blocks together to build an application. No typing required. Credit goes to these awesome [developers](https://code.google.com/p/blockly/wiki/Credits#Engineers)
and a small army of [translators](https://code.google.com/p/blockly/wiki/Credits#Translators).

This repository contains the source code for the apps [Blockly](https://code.google.com/p/blockly/) based 20 hour curriculum and Hour of Code. Information about Blockly can be found in the [wiki](https://code.google.com/p/blockly/w/list).

## Quick Start

### Install prerequisite: Cairo

One of the node modules, node-canvas, depends on Cairo being installed.

Instructions for MacOSX using [brew](http://brew.sh/) (instructions for other platforms [can be found here](https://github.com/LearnBoost/node-canvas/wiki)):

1. Make sure XCode Command-line Tools are installed and up-to-date: `xcode-select --install`
1. Install [XQuartz from here](http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/)
1. `export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig"`
1. `brew update`
1. `brew install cairo`
1. In blockly, `npm install`

### Installing Blockly

```
cd blockly

# Machine setup (OSX with Homebrew)
brew install node
npm install -g grunt-cli
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig"
npm install -g canvas

# Perform first full build
npm install
MOOC_DEV=1 grunt build
```

### Seeing your development version of Blockly in Dashboard

1. To make your changes show up in dashboard, run the following after the first time you build blockly:
  ```
  cd ../dashboard
  bundle exec rake 'blockly:dev[../blockly]'
  cd ../blockly
  ```

1. If you find your changes are not showing up within dashboard, you may have accidentally reverted your symlink to point to the pre-built version of blockly (e.g. when switching branches or stashing changes). To check your symlink, run:
  ```
  git status
  ```
and look for something like `public/blockly -> blockly-package` in the output. [NEEDS VALIDATION].

1. If the symlink is in place, then when you run later builds of blockly, your results should show up in Dashboard.

### Building during development

#### Full build

To run a full build (minus localization):

```
MOOC_DEV=1 grunt build
```

* `MOOC_DEV=1` builds a 'debug' version with more readable javascript
* `grunt rebuild` does a `clean` before a `build`

See also: [Full build with blockly-core](#full-build-with-blockly-core-changes)

#### Running with live-reload server

```
grunt dev
open http://localhost:8000
```

This will serve a few sample blockly apps at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and live-reload changes to blockly.  Caveats:
* This does not update asset files. For that, use a full `grunt build`.
* The live-reload server does not pick up changes to blockly-core.  For that, see [Full build with blockly-core](#full-build-with-blockly-core-changes).
* If you get `Error: EMFILE, too many open files` while running the live-reload server (common on OSX) try increasing the OS open file limit by running `ulimit -n 1024` (and adding it to your `.bashrc`).

##### Rebuild only a single app

To have grunt rebuild only a single app, use the MOOC_APP parameter:

```
MOOC_APP=studio grunt dev
```

##### Build a single foreign language

To have grunt build a single foreign language, use the MOOC_LOCALE parameter. This will build en_us, en_loc, and the specified locale

```
MOOC_LOCALE=ar_sa grunt build
```

#### Running tests

```
grunt build # run a non-debug build before testing
grunt test
```
* If you see an error like `ReferenceError: Blockly is not defined` or notes about missing npm packages, double check that you've run `grunt build` before `grunt test`
* Right now, the tests require a full/production build to pass.  Failures like `Cannot set property 'imageDimensions_' of undefined` in setup steps may indicate that you are testing against a debug build.
* `grunt test` will also be run via Travis CI when you create a pull request

To run an individual test, use the `--grep` option to target a file or Mocha `describe` identifier:

```
grunt mochaTest --grep myTestName # e.g., 2_11, or requiredBlockUtils
```

To debug tests using the node-inspector Chrome-like debugger:

```
npm install -g node-inspector
node-inspector &
# open debugger URL, i.e. http://127.0.0.1:8080/debug?port=5858
node --debug-brk $(which grunt) mochaTest --grep='testname'
# This will breakpoint your inspector at the beginning of that test
```
Not there are two classes of mochaTests we have. The first class run in the same process as grunt, and the above commands will work a expected.
For the second class, we launch a new node process, which your debugger will not have broken on. To debug this second class, we added a --dbg
command that will break the debugger on the node process launch on port 5859.
```
grunt mochaTest --grep='testname' --dbg
# open debugger URL on port 5859, i.e. http://127.0.0.1:8080/debug?port=5859
```

- You can add new test files as /test/*Tests.js, see `/test/feedbackTests.js` as an example of adding a mock Blockly instance
- Blockly tests typically target built files in the `build/js` folder


#### Full build with blockly-core changes

1. Check out [blockly-core](https://github.com/code-dot-org/blockly-core/) as a sibling directory to blockly.
1. `./build_with_core.sh debug`
  * The `debug` flag builds debug versions of both blockly-core and blockly, suitable for debugging
1. `grunt dev`

### Localization

It's especially important to test your changes with localization when modifying layouts. We support
right-to-left languages and have some special layout tweaks embedded in the CSS to support that.

Running a full localization build can take several minutes. Since localization re-builds javascript files for many languages, the default build target locales are `en_us` and `en_ploc` (pseudolocalized). To build
all available locales, specify `MOOC_LOCALIZE=1` in your environment when running a task:

```bash
MOOC_LOCALIZE=1 grunt rebuild
```

Note: Using the live-reload server with localization builds is prone to the `Error: EMFILE, too many open files` problem.  See the `ulimit` fix [under the live-reload server heading](#running-with-live-reload-server).

#### Forwarding new strings on to CrowdIn

To get new strings localized using CrowdIn, we currently run a script in a private repository. Contact a code.org engineer to trigger an update.

### Adding a new npm package

To add a new package using npm, e.g., `lodash`, run: `npm i --save-dev lodash`

- `--save-dev` adds the dependency to node's package.json, freezing the current version
- Because the build process is done in dev mode, include dependencies as devDependencies rather than production dependencies

We'd love to have you join our group of contributors!

For notes on our pull process, where to find tasks to work on, etc.â€”see the Dashboard [contribution guide](https://github.com/code-dot-org/dashboard#contributing).

### Style Guide

- In general follow Google's javascript style [guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml).
- 80 character line length.
- 2 space indent.
- 4 space indent on long line breaks.
- `grunt jshint` should report 0 warnings or errors.
