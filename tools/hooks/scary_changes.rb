        If you'd like Drone to test your changes across all browsers
        (instead of only in Chrome, the default),
        amend your commit message to include the tag [test all browsers] if you haven't already.

        Note that (as of January 2021) Drone will not successfully run all tests across all browsers,
        so you may need another commit without the [test all browsers] tag
        if you'd like to see all tests (in Chrome) passing in Drone without manual inspection.

        In production, database migrations may be applied much earlier than when application servers are upgraded.
        Have you verified that the updated database schema works with the previously deployed application version?

        Making these types of changes on a large table (>10M rows) needs to be reviewed and
        tested with the Infrastructure cabal to avoid negatively impacting production database performance.
        The may cause MySQL to rebuild the entire table.

                This is probably a mistake.

        #{changes.join("\n")}

                Dropbox creates these files typically when 2 people change the same file at the same time.
                See https://www.dropbox.com/help/syncing-uploads/conflicted-copy

                Compare the file with its root (same filename minus the conflicted copy part). If they're identical,
                it's safe to delete the copy.
                Otherwise follow-up with the content editor mentioned in the copy and resolve the diff.

                If this change is intentional, you can bypass this message with the
                  --no-verify
                flag.
