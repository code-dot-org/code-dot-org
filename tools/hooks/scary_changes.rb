        Looks like you are adding dropbox conflicted copy files.

#{changes.join("\n")}

        Dropbox creates these files typically when 2 people change the same file at the same time.
        See https://www.dropbox.com/help/syncing-uploads/conflicted-copy

        Compare the file with its root (same filename minus the conflicted copy part). If they're identical,
        it's safe to delete the copy.
        Otherwise follow-up with the content editor mentioned in the copy and resolve the diff.

        If this change is intentional, you can bypass this message with the
          --no-verify
        flag.
