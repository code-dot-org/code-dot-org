# Contributing

We'd love to have you join our group of contributors! Please e-mail your areas of interest and your availability to contributing@code.org, and weâ€™ll be happy to match you with a project.

This project adheres to the [Open Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct]. By participating, you are expected to honor this code.
[code-of-conduct]: http://todogroup.org/opencodeofconduct/#Code.org/abuse@code.org

You can start setting up with these next steps:

1. Anyone who would like to contribute to **[Code.org](https://github.com/code-dot-org/)** projects **must read and sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://na2.docusign.net/Member/PowerFormSigning.aspx?PowerFormId=8eb90665-c9f7-4b06-81a5-11d12020f251)**. We can't accept pull requests from contributors who haven't yet signed the CLA.

2. Get your local development build working by following our [SETUP](SETUP.md). Fork our repo and make sure to merge our staging branch into yours **WEEKLY** as we do update frequently.

## Code Style

Please make sure your code conforms to our [style guide](STYLEGUIDE.md).  We have implemented linting to help you with this:

* To ensure our precommit linting hook is installed, run `rake install:hooks`. You should only have to do this once.
* To lint the entire project, run `rake lint` from the repository root.  This will check all Ruby, JavaScript and HAML.
* To lint only part of the project, run one of these commands from the repository root:
  * dashboard: `cd dashboard && rubocop && haml-lint`
  * pegasus Ruby: `cd pegasus && rubocop`
  * pegasus HAML: `haml-lint pegasus`
  * apps: See the [apps README](./apps#style-guide)


## Testing

Please test your changes before submitting them to us!

### Manual testing

We support recent versions of Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer, Edge, iOS Safari and the Android browsers ([full list of supported browsers and versions](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/202591743)). Be sure to try your feature out in [IE9](docs/testing-ie9.md), iOS and Android if it's a risk. [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/manual) or [BrowserStack live](http://www.browserstack.com) let you run manual tests in these browsers remotely.

### Unit tests

For dashboard changes, be sure to test your changes using `rake test`. For [apps or blockly](./apps) changes, see our [grunt testing instructions](./apps#running-tests).

### UI tests

Our continuous integration server regularly runs a suite of [UI tests](./dashboard/test/ui) using Selenium / Cucumber which run against many browsers via [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/), and can also be run locally using `chromedriver`. See the [README](./dashboard/test/ui) in that folder for instructions.

If your changes might affect level paths, blockly UI, or critical path site logic, be sure to test your changes with a local UI test.

## Submitting your Pull Request

Once you've linted and tested your changes, send us a pull request!  Contributors should follow the GitHub [fork-and-pull model](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) to submit pull requests into this repository.  Code.org developers should also work on a branch and use a pull request to merge to staging; please do not merge directly to the code-dot-org/staging branch.

1. On your fork, you'll either push to your own finished branch or checkout a new branch for your feature before you start your feature
    - `git checkout -b branch_name`
2. Develop the new feature and push the changes to **your** fork and branch
    - `git add YYY`
    - `git commit -m "ZZZ"`
    - `git push origin branch_name`
3. Go to the code-dot-org GitHub page
    - [https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org](https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org)
4. For your submission to be reviewed
    - Click on the "Pull Request" link, look over and confirm your diff
    - Submit a pull request for your branch to be merged into staging
    - For bonus points, include screenshots in the description. Command + Ctrl + Shift + 4 in OS X lets you copy a screen selection to your clipboard, which GitHub will let you paste right into the description
5. After your pull request is merged into staging, you can review your changes on the following sites:
  * [https://staging.code.org/](https://staging.code.org/)
  * [https://staging-studio.code.org/](https://staging-studio.studio.code.org/)
  * [https://staging.csedweek.org/](https://staging.csedweek.org/)
