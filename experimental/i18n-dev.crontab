# Run a CI Build to update the server from staging. We do this primarily to
# make sure the server gets seeded with latest level content for the sync in.
# Note that the CI_ONLY_BUILD environment variable is necessary; the server is
# not set up to actually serve a version of the website, and it will fail to
# build correctly if not thus restricted.

# Run the I18n Sync!
# Sync is scheduled for 12:30 AM PST every Monday; run around midnight so the
# sync is hopefully finished by start of day on Monday, offset by 30 minutes so
# we don't conflict with the ci_build which runs on the hour.

# Run the sync down periodically throughout the week. Specifically:
# - Run it every other hour. This is a somewhat arbitrarily-chosen frequency
#   for a test period. We expect to refine this over time.
# - Run it on the half-hour. Like for the full sync, this is done to reduce the
#   chance of colliding with the CI Build.
# - Run it every day except Monday. This is done so we don't conflict with the
#   full sync, and also because we expect to spend Monday verifiying the
#   results of the full sync.
