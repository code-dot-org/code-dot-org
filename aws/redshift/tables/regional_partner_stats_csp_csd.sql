--CHANGES
-- addition of school years beyond 2017
-- removed 'location'

-- CHANGED DEPENDENCIES
-- before using this code to update analysis.regional_partner_stats_csp_csd, certain other tables need to have their names changed, and their references updated here
-- similarly, the tables analysis.teacher_most_progress and analysis.student_activity need to be updated and then their references in this file replaced with the originals
-- these two also need to be updated on Github

-- NOTES ON HOW TO UPDATE 
-- after updating at the dependencies listed above and noted with 'PUBLIC' in the code....
-- replace all instances of 'public.regional_partner_stats_csp_csd_test' with 'analysis.regional_partner_stats_csp_csd' and re-run table creation
-- this table will be generated daily from code hosted on github, so need to talk to Ben about how to update that process

drop table if exists analysis.regional_partner_stats_csp_csd;
