--CHANGES
-- addition of school years beyond 2017 --  includes teaching data from the same year they were trained and any subsequent years 
-- removed 'location'

-- ISSUES
-- right now this analysis depends primarily on the teachers_trained views, which contain one entry per person, with the corresponding 'first year trained' as the school_year
      -- this means that if teachers are trained in multiple years then only info from their first year of training will get joined
      -- to Mary, this does not seem ideal 
      
-- CHANGED DEPENDENCIES
-- before using this code to update analysis.regional_partner_stats, certain other tables need to be updated, and their references updated here
-- analysis.csf_teachers_trained and analysis.csp_csd_teachers_trained need to be updated using the code in the file 'teahers_trained_updates.sql'
-- then, references in this file to public.csf_teachers_trained_test and public.csp_csd_teachers_trained_test should be replaced with 'analysis.csf_teachers_trained' and 'analysis.csp_csd_teachers_trained'
-- these are views and so do not need to be added to Github
-- similarly, the tables analysis.teacher_most_progress and analysis.student_activity need to be updated and then their references in this file replaced with the originals
-- these two need to be updated on Github

-- NOTES ON HOW TO UPDATE 
-- after updating at the dependencies listed above and noted with 'PUBLIC' in the code....
-- replace all instances of 'public.regional_partner_stats_csf_pivoted' with 'analysis.regional_partner_stats_csf' and re-run table creation
-- this table will be generated daily from code hosted on github, so need to talk to Ben about how to update that process
