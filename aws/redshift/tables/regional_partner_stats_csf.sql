-- ISSUES
-- right now this analysis depends primarily on the teachers_trained views, which contain one entry per person, with the corresponding 'first year trained' as the school_year
      -- this means that if teachers are trained in multiple years then only info from their first year of training will get joined
      -- to Mary, this does not seem ideal
