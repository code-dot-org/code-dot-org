# Internationalization

## Overview

This directory contains the source data files for all internationalization on
code.org and hourofcode.com. These files should not be directly modified; they
will be regularly updated by the [i18n sync scripts](../bin/i18n/), which will
also distribute changes out to the various locations in the repository where
they will be handled.

## Modifying/Adding a new string

When adding a string, please make the key as descriptive as possible because
this is used as context for translators.

### Pegasus

#### Modifying an existing string

-   Update the string in the [i18n Gsheet][0]
-   `ssh staging.code.org` and check that your changes were synced to
    `staging/pegasus/cache/i18n/en-US.yml`
-   Commit and push `en-US.yml`

#### Adding a new string

-   Add a unique key and your string value to the [i18n Gsheet][0]. 

    -   NOTE: Make sure your string value only has plain HTML. Organization is
        by category/page; try to prepend each string of a common category with
        the same key. For example, all teacher dashboard strings begin with 'dashboard'
        so they're easier to find.

-   ssh into staging and check that your changes were synced to
    `staging/pegasus/cache/i18n/en-US.yml`

-   Run the following script to sync your change to all locales.

        bin/i18n/sync-pegasus

-   Add, commit, and push all the files in `i18n/locales` and `pegasus/cache/i18n`.

        git add i18n/locales pegasus/cache/i18n

        git commit -m "sync pegasus strings mm/dd -yourname"

        git push

### Apps

-   Make changes in `code-dot-org/apps/i18n/<app>/en_us.json`
-   After you push to staging, rake build:apps will run sync-apps.sh and update
    all locale files.
-   If you are creating a new app:
    -   Add the strings in a new file in `code-dot-org/apps/i18n/<new
        app>/en_us.json`
    -   Add the app name to the list of "untranslated apps" in
        `code-dot-org/i18n/code.org/copy-untranslated-apps.rb`

### Dashboard

-   Make changes in `dashboard/config/locales`. Choose from the following files
    depending on where it best fits categorically.
    -   `en.yml` - general strings used throughout Code Studio or if it doesn't
        fit in any of the other files
    -   `data.en.yml` - mostly strings related to accelerated course and video
        titles
    -   `devise.en.yml` - sign in, sign up, account related
    -   `scripts.en.yml` - course descriptions and stage names. Should be
        generated by editing the course on levelbuilder, but can be updated
        directly.
    -   `slides.en.yml` - the screenshots and transcripts that accompany each
        tutorial video
    -   `unplugged.en.yml` - titles and descriptions for unplugged levels.

#### Content Changes

Several Dashboard i18n files are updated automatically from levelbuilder content
and should not be edited directly. These include:

-   `authored_hints.en.yml`
-   `callouts.en.yml`
-   `courses.en.yml`
-   `dsls.en.yml`
-   `failure_message_overrides.en.yml`
-   `instructions.en.yml`
-   `markdown_instructions.en.yml`


## Updating UI Tests

Many UI tests compare against strings on the page to validate expected results.
Follow the instructions in the Dashboard UI Tests README to verify that the UI
tests still pass after changing a string, or update them if necessary.
