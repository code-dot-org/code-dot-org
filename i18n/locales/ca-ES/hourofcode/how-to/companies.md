# How to host an Hour of Code event with students

## 1. Promote your Hour of Code

- Promoure el seu esdeveniment [d'Hores de codi](%= resolve_url('/promote') %) i animar altres per acollir un.
- Encourage software engineers at your company to visit a local classroom to help lead an Hour of Code and inspire students to study computer science. Poden [inscriure's](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/volunteer/engineer') %) per estar connectat amb una aula.

## 2. Watch this how-to video <iframe width="500" height="255" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/SrnvvWDm73k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen mark="crwd-mark"></iframe> 

## 3. Choose an activity

We host a variety of [fun, hour-long activities](%= resolve_url('/learn') %) for participants of all ages, created by a variety of partners. Prova'ls!

**All Hour of Code activities** require minimal prep-time, and are self-guided - allowing participants to work at their own pace and skill-level.

## 4. Plan your technology needs - computers are optional

The best Hour of Code experience includes Internet-connected computers. But you **don’t** need a computer for every participant, and you can even do the Hour of Code without a computer at all.

**Plan Ahead!** Do the following before your event starts:

- Test activities on computers or devices. Make sure they work properly on browsers with sound and video.
- Provide headphones, or ask participants to bring their own, if the activity you choose works best with sound.
- **Don't have enough devices?** Use [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q). When participants partner up, they help each other and rely less on the organizer. Ells veuen també que la informàtica és social i col·laborativa.
- **Have low bandwidth?** Plan to show videos at the front of the event, so each participant isn't downloading their own videos. Or try the unplugged / offline activities.

## 5. Start your Hour of Code off with an inspiring video

Kick off your Hour of Code by inspiring participants and discussing how computer science impacts every part of our lives. Share more about what inspired you to pursue computer science and your role at your company.

**Show an inspirational video:**

- The original Code.org launch video, featuring Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and NBA star Chris Bosh (there are [1 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYZF6oIZtfc), [5 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc), and [9 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1xS07N-FA) versions).
- The [Hour of Code Worldwide video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsOIlDT145A)
- [President Obama calling on all students to learn computer science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvmhE1J9PY).
- Find more inspirational video [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNfpD8i4Sx7U0y2MccnrNZuP).

**Ideas to introduce your Hour of Code activity to students:**

- Explain ways technology impacts our lives, with examples both boys and girls will care about - talk about technology that’s saving lives, helping people, connecting people. 
- If you are a tech company, demo fun, innovative products your company is working on.
- If you aren’t a tech company, discuss ways your company uses technology to solve problems and accomplish goals.
- Invite software engineers from your company to speak about why they decided to study computer science and the projects they work on.
- See tips for getting girls interested in computer science [here](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/girls') %).

## 6. Code!

**Direct participants to the activity**

- Write the activity link on a whiteboard. Find the link listed on the [information for your selected activity](%= resolve_url('/learn') %) under the number of participants.
- For younger students, load the activity page ahead of time or save it as a bookmark.

**When participants come across difficulties it's okay to respond:**

- "No ho sé. Esbrinem-ho junts."
- "La tecnologia no sempre funciona com volem."
- Aprendre a programar és com aprendre una nova llengua; no se n'aprèn de seguida!

**What to do if someone finishes early?**

- They can try another Hour of Code activity at hourofcode.com/learn
- Or, ask them to help a friend who are having trouble with the activity.
