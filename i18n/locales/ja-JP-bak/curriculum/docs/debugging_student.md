# Code.org Debugging Recipe

These debugging tips will help you keep moving when you get stuck!

## Work to Avoid Mistakes

  * Read the directions.
  * What is the goal of the puzzle?
  * Take it slow and go one step at a time.
  * Can you talk about the problem in your own words?
  * Were you given any code to start? 
      * What does it do?
      * Why do you think it's there?

## Debugging

  * Look for problems each step of the way.
  * Describe what was supposed to happen.
  * Describe what is going wrong.
  * Does the difference between what was supposed to happen and what did happen give you any clues?
  * Fix one thing at a time, then describe how the result changed.
  * Try leaving "breadcrubms" in your program. You can put clues inside your code (like having your program "say" something) to let you know when each chunk runs.
  * Try doing each task as its own chunk, then put all of the pieces together at the end so it is easier to see what each thing does.
  * Try at least three ways of fixing problems before you ask for help.
  * Talk to a friend. Maybe one of your classmates can help you figure out where your plan goes awry.
