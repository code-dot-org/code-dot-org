#### (Based on Polya's Four Step Probelm Solving Process)

These tips will help you get unstuck when solving Code.org puzzles!

## Step 1: Understand the Puzzle

  * What does the puzzle want you to do?
  * Can you talk about the problem in your own words?
  * Were you given any code to start? 
      * What does it do?
      * Why do you think it's there?
  * What is the goal of the puzzle?
  * Have you solved any other puzzles that are like this one?

## Step 2: Create A Plan

#### (Pick one or more)

  * Write an algorithm.
  * Guess and check as you go.
  * Draw a picture of what you want to do.
  * Try working backward.
  * Solve one small piece at a time.
  * Compare to a puzzle that you've already solved.

## Step 3: Perform and Perfect the Plan

  * Did you solve the puzzle?
  * If not, hunt for one error at a time.
  * Retest your plan after every change.
  * If you start to get frustrated, take a deep breath, or leave your screen for a minute. When you come back, you may see what was causing the trouble!
  * Ask questions. Maybe one of your friends can help you figure out where your plan goes awry.

## Step 4: Check Your Work

  * Does your answer solve the puzzle?
