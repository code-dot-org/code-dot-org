# Lesson Tip

Students will have the opportunity to share their final product with a link. This is a great opportunity to show your school community the great things your students are doing. Collect all of the links and keep them on your class website for all to see!

## Activity

### <a name="Activity"></a> [Play Lab: Create a Game](http://learn.code.org/s/course3/stage/17/puzzle/1)

Designing a game that is fun to play yet challenging enough to avoid boredom is a tough task. Encourage students to consider how their programming choices make different aspects of their game harder, easier, frustrating, and fun.

## Extended Learning

<a name="Extended"></a>Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### Look Under the Hood

When you share a link to your game, you also share all of the code that goes behind it. This is a great way for students to learn from each other.

  * Post links to completed games online or on the board. 
      * Make a game of your own to share as well!
  * When students load up a link, have them click the "How it Works" button to see the code behind the game.
  * Discuss as a group the different ways your classmates coded their stories. 
      * What suprised you?
      * What would you like to try?
  * Choose someone else's game and build on it. (Don't worry; the original game will be safe.)
