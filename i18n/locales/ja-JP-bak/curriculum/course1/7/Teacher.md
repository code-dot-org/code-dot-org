## Lesson Overview

In this lesson students will help their bees to collect nectar from flowers and create honey in honeycombs. This builds on the Maze levels by adding action blocks to the movement blocks students are already familiar with.

## Lesson Objectives

### Students will:

  * Express movement as a series of commands.
  * Order movement commands as sequential steps in a program.
  * Represent an algorithm as a computer program.
  * Convert a whole number to the equivalent quantity of individual blocks.
  * Distinguish between flowers and honeycombs.
  * Express the relationships between flowers, nectar, honeycombs, and honey.

## Getting Started

### <a name="GetStarted"></a> Introduction

  * Poll students for prior knowledge about bees. 
      * Bees collect nectar from flowers and create honey in honeycombs.
      * They communicate using intricate dance steps, which is similar to the instruction steps they'll be using to control their bee.
  * In addition to moving, you'll also be using some new code to let your bee collect nectar and make honey. 
      * When you see a flower, collect nectar.
      * When you see a honeycomb, make honey.

## Activity

### <a name="Activity"></a> [Bee: Sequence](http://learn.code.org/s/course1/stage/7/puzzle/1)

Point out to students that each flower and honeycomb has a little number next to it. That number tells you how much nectar to collect or honey to make.

  * Have students count their nectar and honey blocks out loud.
