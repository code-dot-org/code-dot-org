## Contenido de la Lección

En esta serie de actividades los estudiantes enriquecerán la compresión de algoritmos aprendida con las actividades fuera de línea 'Mapas Felices' y 'Muévelo'. Utilizando personajes del juego Angry Birds, los estudiantes desarrollarán algoritmos secuenciales para mover un pájaro desde un lado del laberinto hasta el cerdo que se encuentra en el otro lado.

## Obejtivos de la Lección

### Los estudiantes podrán:

  * Ordenar comandos de movimiento como pasos secuenciales en un programa
  * Representar un algoritmo como un programa de computadora
  * Contar el número de veces que una acción deber ser ejecutada y representarlo como instrucciones en un programa

## Comenzando

### <a name="GetStarted"></a> Introducción

Pregunta a tus estudiantes si están familiarizados con el juego Angry Birds. Explica que escribirán programas para ayudar a un Angry Bird a encontrar un cerdo.

  * Repasa los puntos cardinales.
  * Usa el recordatorio NEOS y dile a tus estudiantes que verán esas letras en sus programas al lado de las flechas de dirección.
  * Conseguir que el pájaro llegue al cerdo requerirá poner las direcciones en un orden o secuencia muy específico.
  * ¿Puedes resolver los retos usando la menor cantidad de bloques posible?

# Sugerencia para la Lección

Anima a los estudiantes a continuar usando el método de programación en parejas que aprendieron en la lección pasada. Pídeles volver a asignar los papeles de conductor y navegante.

## Activity

### <a name="Activity"></a> [Maze: Sequence](http://learn.code.org/s/course1/stage/4/puzzle/1)

As your students work through the puzzles, observe how they plan the path for the bird. Identify different strategies used and ask students to share with the whole class. This helps students to recognize that there are many ways to approach these problems. You may want to go through a few puzzles on the projector. While doing this you can ask a one student to trace the path on the screen while another writes the directions on a whiteboard.

## Extended Learning

<a name="Extended"></a>Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### Create Your Own

In small groups, let students design their own mazes and challenge each other to write programs to solve them. For added fun, make life-size mazes with students as the pig and bird.
