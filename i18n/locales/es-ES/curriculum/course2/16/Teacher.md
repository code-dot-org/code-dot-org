## Getting Started

### <a name="GetStarted"></a> Introduction

  * Review The Big Event activity with students: 
      * What did we "program" the button click events to do?
  * Now we're going to add events to our coding. Specifically, we're going to create an event for clicking the mouse and the bird hitting an object. 
      * In video game programming we call this kind of event collision detection; it lets us decide what to do when one thing collides with, or touches, another.
      * What kinds of collision events have you seen in games?

# Sugerencia para la Lección

Students will have the opportunity to share their final product with a link. This is a great opportunity to show your school community the great things your students are doing. Collect all of the links and keep them on your class website for all to see!

## Activity

### <a name="Activity"></a> [Flappy](http://learn.code.org/s/course2/stage/16/puzzle/1)

In the final stage of this lesson students are able to tweak their game to make it unique - encourage them to see how different they can make each game within the constraints provided.

## Extended Learning

<a name="Extended"></a>Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### Look Under the Hood

When you share a link to your game, you also share all of the code that goes behind it. This is a great way for students to learn from each other.

  * Post links to completed games online or on the board. 
      * Make a game of your own to share as well!
  * When students load up a link, have them click the "How it Works" button to see the code behind the game.
  * Discuss as a group the different ways your classmates coded their games. 
      * What suprised you?
      * What would you like to try?
  * Choose someone else's game and build on it. (Don't worry; the original game will be safe.)
