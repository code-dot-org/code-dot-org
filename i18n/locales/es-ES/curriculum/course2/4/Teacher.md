## Obejtivos de la Lección

### Students will:

  * Create a program to complete an image using sequential steps
  * Select an argument for a given command
  * Differentiate between defining and non-defining attributes of triangles, squares, and rectangles
  * Draw triangles, squares, and rectangles to reflect defining attributes
  * Explain the difference between squares and rectangles and support it with evidence consisting of the commands used to draw the different shapes
  * Compare and contrast squares and rectangles by their number of sides and side lengths
  * Compose two-dimensional shapes (rectangles, squares, trapezoids, triangles) to create a composite shape, such as two squares to compose a rectangle and two rectangles to compose a square
  * Compose new shapes from composite shapes
  * Draw partitions into a rectangle and describe the partitions using the words halves, fourths, quarters, half of, fourth of, and quarter of
  * Describe a whole rectangle as two halves or four quarters
  * Explain that decomposing into more equal shares creates smaller shares

## Getting Started

### <a name="GetStarted"></a> Introduction

Brainstorm with students ways to tell someone else how to draw a picture:

  * How would you do that with a computer?
  * In these puzzles you will be moving a character who leaves a line everywhere it goes.

## Activity

### <a name="Activity"></a> [Artist: Sequence](http://learn.code.org/s/course2/stage/4/puzzle/1)

In the Artist levels students will no longer be constrained to 90 degree angles. Having protractors available can be help students better visualize the angles they need.

## Extended Learning

<a name="Extended"></a>Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### The Copy Machine

  * Give students two pieces of paper
  * On one sheet draw a simple image, using straight lines only.
  * On the second sheet draw instructions for recreating that image commands to move straight and turn at various angles.
  * Trade instruction sheets and attempt to recreate the image using only the provided instructions.

### ISTE Standards (formerly NETS)

  * 1.a - Apply existing knowledge to generate new ideas, products, or processes.
  * 1.c - Use models and simulation to explore complex systems and issues.
  * 4.b - Plan and manage activities to develop a solution or complete a project.
  * 6.a - Understand and use technology systems.
  * 6.c - Troubleshoot systems and applications.
  * 6.d - Transfer current knowledge to learning of new technologies. 

### CSTA K-12 Computer Science Standards

  * CT.L1:3-01. Use technology resources (e.g., puzzles, logical thinking programs) to solve age appropriate problems.
  * CL.L1:3-02. Work cooperatively and collaboratively with peers teachers, and others using technology.
  * CPP.L1:6-05. Construct a program as a set of step-by-step instructions to be acted out.
  * CPP.L1:6-06. Implement problem solutions using a block-based visual programming language.
  * CT.L2-01. Use the basic steps in algorithmic problem solving to design solutions.
  * CT.L2-06. Describe and analyze a sequence of instructions being followed.
  * CT.L2-08. Use visual representations of problem states, structures, and data.
  * CT.L2-12. Use abstraction to decompose a problem into sub problems.

### Next-Gen Science Standards

  * K-2-PS3-2. Use tools and materials provided to design and build a device that solves a specific problem or a solution to a specific problem.
  * 3-5-ETS1-2. Generate and compare multiple possible solutions to a problem based on how well each is likely to meet the criteria and constraints of the problem.

### Common Core Mathematical Practices

  *   1. Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.
  *   1. Reason abstractly and quantitatively.
  *   1. Model with mathematics.
  *   1. Use appropriate tools strategically.
  *   1. Attend to precision.
  *   1. Look for and make use of structure.
  *   1. Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.

### Common Core Math Standards

  * 1.OA.1 - Use addition and subtraction within 20 to solve word problems involving situations of adding to, taking from, putting together, taking apart, and comparing, with unknowns in all positions, e.g., by using objects, drawings, and equations.
  * 1.G.A.1 - Distinguish between defining attributes (e.g., triangles are closed and three-sided) versus non-defining attributes (e.g., color, orientation, overall size); build and draw shapes to possess defining attributes.
  * 1.G.A.2 - Compose two-dimensional shapes (rectangles, squares, trapezoids, triangles, half-circles, and quarter-circles) or three-dimensional shapes (cubes, right rectangular prisms, right circular cones, and right circular cylinders) to create a composite shape, and compose new shapes from the composite shape.
  * 2.OA.1 - Use addition and subtraction within 100 to solve one- and two-step word problems involving situations of adding to, taking from, putting together, taking apart, and comparing, with unknowns in all positions.
  * 2.G.A.1 - Recognize and draw shapes having specified attributes, such as a given number of angles or a given number of equal faces.
  * 3.OA.3 - Use multiplication and division within 100 to solve word problems in situations involving equal groups, arrays, and measurement quantities.
  * 3.G.A.2 - Partition shapes into parts with equal areas. Express the area of each part as a unit fraction of the whole.

### Common Core Language Arts Standards

  * SL.1.1 - Participate in collaborative conversations with diverse partners about grade 1 topics and texts with peers and adults in small and larger groups.
  * L.1.5 - Add drawings or other visual displays to descriptions when appropriate to clarify ideas, thoughts, and feelings.
  * L.1.6 - Use words and phrases acquired through conversations, reading and being read to, and responding to texts, including using frequently occurring conjunctions to signal simple relationships.
  * SL.2.1 - Participate in collaborative conversations with diverse partners about grade 2 topics and texts with peers and adults in small and larger groups.
  * L.2.6 - Use words and phrases acquired through conversations, reading and being read to, and responding to texts, including using adjectives and adverbs to describe.
  * SL.3.1 - Engage effectively in a range of collaborative discussions (one-on-one, in groups, and teacher-led) with diverse partners on grade 3 topics and texts, building on others' ideas and expressing their own clearly.
  * L.3.6 - Acquire and use accurately grade-appropriate conversational, general academic, and domain-specific words and phrases, including those that signal spatial and temporal relationships.
