## Obejtivos de la Lección

### Students will:

  * Identify actions that correlate to input events
  * Create an animated, interactive story using sequence, loops, and event-handlers
  * Share a creative artifact with other students

## Getting Started

### <a name="GetStarted"></a> Introduction

Review the event handling students did in Bounce:

  * What did events did you use in coding Flappy?
  * Now you're going to animate multiple characters using events triggered by the arrow keys to tell a story.
  * This is your chance to get really creative!

# Sugerencia para la Lección

Students will have the opportunity to share their final product with a link. This is a great opportunity to show your school community the great things your students are doing. Collect all of the links and keep them on your class website for all to see!

## Activity

### <a name="Activity"></a> [Play Lab: Create a Story](http://learn.code.org/s/course3/stage/16/puzzle/1)

This is one of the most free-form plugged activities of the course. At the final stage students have the freedom to create a story of their own. You may want to provide structured guidelines around what kind of story to write, partiularly for students who are overwhelmed by too many options.

## Extended Learning

<a name="Extended"></a>Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### Look Under the Hood

When you share a link to your story, you also share all of the code that goes behind it. This is a great way for students to learn from each other.

  * Post links to completed stories online or on the board. 
      * Make a story of your own to share as well!
  * When students load up a link, have them click the "How it Works" button to see the code behind the story.
  * Discuss as a group the different ways your classmates coded their stories. 
      * What suprised you?
      * What would you like to try?
  * Choose someone else's story and build on it. (Don't worry; the original story will be safe.)
