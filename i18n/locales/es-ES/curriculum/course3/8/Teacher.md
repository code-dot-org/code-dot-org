## Lesson Objectives

### Students will:

  * Compare properties and values using >, =, < symbols
  * Translate spoken language conditional statements into a program
  * Execute an algorithm with a conditional statement
  * Use conditional statements to make logic-based choices
  * Nest conditionals to analyze multiple value conditions using if, else if, else logic
  * Write functions that execute nested conditionals

## Getting Started

### <a name="GetStarted"></a> Introduction

Similar to the last previous conditionals stage, only this time we're helping the zombie reach the sunflower.

## Activity

### <a name="Activity"></a> [Maze: Conditionals](http://learn.code.org/s/course3/stage/8/puzzle/1)

The conditionals in this stage pertain to whether or not there is a path available to the right, left, or ahead. If there is chomper in the way, the conditional will report that there is no path available in that direction.

## Extended Learning

<a name="Extended"></a>Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### True/False Tag

  * Line students up as if to play [Red Light / Green Light](http://www.gameskidsplay.net/games/sensing_games/rl_gl.htm).
  * Select one person to stand in front as the Caller.
  * The Caller chooses a condition and asks everyone who meets that condition to take a step forward. 
      * If you have a red belt, step forward.
      * If you are wearing sandals, take a step forward.
  * Try switching it up by saying things like "If you are *not* blonde, step forward."

### Nesting

  * Break students up into pairs or small groups.
  * Have them write if statements for playing cards on strips of paper, such as: 
      * If the suit is clubs
      * If the color is red
  * Have students create similar strips for outcomes. 
      * Add one point
      * Subtract one point
  * Once that's done, have students choose three of each type of strip and three playing cards, paying attention to the order selected.
  * Using three pieces of paper, have students write three different programs using only the sets of strips that they selected, in any order. 
      * Encourage students to put some if statements inside other if statements.
  * Now, students should run through all three programs using the cards that they drew, in the same order for each program.  
      * Did any two programs return the same answer?
      * Did any return something different?
