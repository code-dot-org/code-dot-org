        Now let's go one level deeper! We've
        nested that whole block of code into another loop, but you need to get the
        artist back in place to draw the next line. Which of these code blocks can
        you place at the end of the outermost loop to draw the whole grid?
      4-5 Artist Patterns 8: |-
        Use a loop to draw this hexagon with 40

        A circle is a special shape. Can you figure out

      grade4_frozen_functions1a: |-
        Use the new “Create a circle” block to

        Here's a ”Create circle”

        Did you know every snowflake is
