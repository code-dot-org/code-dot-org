        Now let's go one level deeper! We've
        nested that whole block of code into another loop, but you need to get the
        artist back in place to draw the next line. Which of these code blocks can
        you place at the end of the outermost loop to draw the whole grid?
      4-5 Artist Patterns 8: |-
        Use a loop to draw this hexagon with 40

        A circle is a special shape. Can you figure out
        what number to replace the question marks with to draw a circle?
      grade4_frozen_functions1a: |-
        Use the new “Create a circle” block to

        Now let's create 20 overlapping

        Here's a ”Create circle”
        block that can make circles of different sizes. Can you use this to create

        Did you know every snowflake is

        Now, recreate the algorithm from
