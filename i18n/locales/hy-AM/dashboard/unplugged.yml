        title: Ներածություն համակարգչային գիտության
        desc: This lesson will introduce the concept of Computer Science and explain what a Computer Scientist does.  It will also give students an opportunity to assume the role of a computer scientist.  By the end of the activity, each student will have a take-home reminder of what he or she learned.  You may be tempted to skip teaching young children the vocabulary words that are associated with the lessons that follow, but presenting them in a fun and playful light now is far more productive than waiting for more advanced opportunities.

        title: հաշվողական Մտածմունք
        desc: With nothing but paper and markers, students will learn the four steps of computational thinking. After a brief introduction, students should be split into groups where they will have to create directions for other students to draw a specific monster (from a catalog of pre-selected monsters). The entire task must be decomposed, then teams will analyze all monsters in the catalog for patterns, abstract different details from the monsters, then use that information to create an algorithm (directions) for another team to draw a certain monster. Teams will then switch algorithms with another group and draw the monster based on what that algorithm indicates. Is the drawing what the original team intended?

        title: Գրաֆիկի Թուղթ Ծրագրավորում
        desc: By programming one another to draw pictures, students will begin to understand what programming is really about. The class will begin by students instructing each other to color squares on graph paper in an effort to reproduce an existing picture.  If there's time, the lesson can conclude with images that the students create themselves.

        desc: This lesson covers algorithms.  Using tangram shapes and graph paper, the first exercise will show how important it is to make each instruction as clear and unambiguous as possible.  Afterward, the class will explore how many ways you can fold paper into a rectangle, noting how some methods can take more or fewer folds than others.

        title: գործառույթները
        desc: In this lesson, students will make a suncatcher out of string, beads, and a special charm. The students will follow a series of repetitive steps, then be asked to identify certain sets of "skills" that are duplicated several times. Once those skills are defined, they will be called from a main program and the whole beautiful process of creation will be recorded on a single sheet of paper. The final program will be geared toward the entire class, whatever their type of string, beads, and charms. To effectively allow for this, students will need to "abstract out" the details of their specific materials and create vague terms for an individual's supplies.  This use of generic placeholders is a wonderful introduction to variables.

        title: Song Writing
        desc: Reading lyrics is a pretty intuitive venture for most students.  We'll take an activity that's already common knowledge and shift it into a solid education on defining and calling functions. Once students are familiar with the define/call process, we will add the extra capabilities that come along with passing parameters within those function calls.

        desc: Students run a relay race, where they dash across the yard to write an algorithm based on a "Graph Paper Programming" image. They can only write one instruction at a time and if there's an error somewhere, they have to erase everything back to that point.
      Conditionals:
        title: conditionals
        desc: To learn about conditional statements, students play a card game and create rules like "If I draw a red card, I get a point" and "If I draw a black card, you get a point."

      TangramAlgorithms:
        title: Tangram Algorithms
        desc: This lesson shows us something important about algorithms. If you keep an algorithm simple there are lots of ways to use it. If you want to make sure everyone ends up with the same thing, then your algorithm needs more detail.
      EnvelopeVariables:
        title: Envelope Variables
        desc: Variables allow for a lot of freedom in computer science.  This lesson helps to explain what variables are and how we can use them in many different ways. Use this activity before (or in conjunction with) the lesson on abstraction to really hit the idea home.
      MadGlibs:
        title: Mad Glibs
        desc: Abstraction is one of the most important skills for a computer scientist to understand.  This activity will have your students analyzing stories for differences so that they can abstract them away. Those abstracted stories become templates for fun and crazy new ones.
      ForLoopFun:

This lesson will help students intuitively understand why combining chunks of code into functions is such a helpful practice.  '
      BinaryImages:
        title: Binary Images
        desc: Though many people think of binary as strictly zeros and ones, our previous courses taught students that information can be represented in a variety of binary options.

      VideoGamesCoordinatePlanes:
        title: Video Games and Coordinate Planes

      ConditionalsPiecewiseFunctions:
        title: Conditionals and Piecewise Functions
        desc: The parameters we pass to functions cause the outputs to vary based on a very rigid pattern. Suppose we want parameters with some values to create outputs using one pattern but other values to use a different pattern. This is where conditionals are needed...
      CollisionDetection:
        title: Collision Detection and the Pythagorean Theorem
        desc: Determining when objects on the screen touch is an important aspect of most games. In this lesson we'll look at how the Pythagorean Theorem and the Distance Formula can be used to measure the distance between two points on the plane, and then decide whether those two points (or game characters) are touching.
