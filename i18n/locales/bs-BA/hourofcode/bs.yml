  oceans_behind_the_scenes: 'AI for Oceans: Behind the Scenes'
  oceans_behind_the_scenes_1: Levels 2-4 use a pretrained model provided by the <a
    href="https://www.tensorflow.org/" >TensorFlow</a> <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/slim/nets/mobilenet_v1.md">
    MobileNet </a> project. A MobileNet model is a <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/practica/image-classification/convolutional-neural-networks">convolutional
    neural network</a> that has been trained on <a href="http://www.image-net.org/">ImageNet</a>,
    a dataset of over 14 million images hand-annotated with words such as "balloon"
    or "strawberry". In order to customize this model with the labeled training data
    the student generates in this activity, we use a technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning">Transfer
    Learning</a>. Each image in the training dataset is fed to MobileNet, as pixels,
    to obtain a list of annotations that are most likely to apply to it. Then, for
    a new image, we feed it to MobileNet and compare its resulting list of annotations
    to those from the training dataset. We classify the new image with the same label
    (such as "fish" or "not fish") as the images from the training set with the most
    similar results.
  oceans_behind_the_scenes_1_markdown: Levels 2-4 use a pretrained model provided
    by the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) [MobileNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/slim/nets/mobilenet_v1.md)
    project. A MobileNet model is a [convolutional neural network](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/practica/image-classification/convolutional-neural-networks)
    that has been trained on [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/), a dataset of over
    14 million images hand-annotated with words such as "balloon" or "strawberry".
    In order to customize this model with the labeled training data the student generates
    in this activity, we use a technique called [Transfer Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning).

    from the training dataset. We classify the new image with the same label (such
    as "fish" or "not fish") as the images from the training set with the most similar
    results.
  oceans_behind_the_scenes_2: Levels 6-8 use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine">Support-Vector
    Machine</a> (SVM). We look at each component of the fish (such as eyes, mouth,
    body) and assemble all of the metadata for the components (such as number of teeth,
    body shape) into a vector of numbers for each fish. We use these vectors to train
    the SVM. Based on the training data, the SVM separates the "space" of all possible
    fish into two parts, which correspond to the classes we are trying to learn (such
    as "blue" or "not blue").

  hoc_faq_title: ČESTO POSTAVLJANA PITANJA
  hoc_faq_what_is_hoc_q: 'Što je Sat kodiranja? '
  hoc_faq_what_is_hoc_a: Sata Kodiranja je počeo kao jednosatni uvod u računarstvo,
    i dizajniran je da demistifikuje "kodiranje", i da demonstrira da svako može naučiti
    osnove i proširiti sudjelovanje u polju računarstva. Sat Kodiranja je od tada
    postao svjetski napor za promoviranje računarstva počevši sa jednim satom aktivnosti
    kodiranja, nakon čega je uslijedilo brzo proširenje. Pogledajte <a href='%{tutorials}'>
    tutorijale i aktivnosti</a>. Ova rasprostranjena kampanja je podržana sa preko
    <a href='%{partners}'> 400 partnera</a> i 200.000 edukatora diljem svijeta.
  hoc_faq_what_is_hoc_a_markdown: The Hour of Code started as a one-hour introduction
    to computer science, designed to demystify "code", to show that anybody can learn
    the basics, and to broaden participation in the field of computer science. It
    has since become a worldwide effort to celebrate computer science, starting with
    1-hour coding activities but expanding to all sorts of community efforts. Check
    out the [tutorials and activities](%{tutorials}). This grassroots campaign is
    supported by over [400 partners](%{partners}) and 200,000 educators worldwide.
  hoc_faq_last_year: Pokušajte tutorijale
  hoc_faq_when_is_hoc_q: Kada je Sat Kodiranja?
  hoc_faq_when_is_hoc_a: Sata Kodiranja se odvija svake godine tijekom <a href='%{csedweek_url}'>
    Sedmice Računarskog Obrazovanja</a>. %{campaign_date_year} Sedmica Računarskog
    Obrazovanja će biti održana na %{campaign_date_full}, dok Sat Kodiranja možete
    ugostiti tokom cijele godine. Sedmica Računarskog Obrazovanja se održava svake
    godine u znak priznanja za rođendana jednog od pionira računarstva <a href='%{grace_hopper}'>
    Admiral Grace Murray Hopper</a> (Decembar 9, 1906).
  hoc_faq_when_is_hoc_a_markdown: The Hour of Code takes place each year during [Computer
    Science Education Week](%{csedweek_url}). The %{campaign_date_year} Computer Science
    Education Week will be %{campaign_date_full}, but you can host an Hour of Code
    all year-round. Computer Science Education Week is held annually in recognition
    of the birthday of computing pioneer [Admiral Grace Murray Hopper](%{grace_hopper})
    (December 9, 1906).
  hoc_faq_why_cs_q: Zašto računarstvo?
  hoc_faq_why_cs_a: "<i>Svakom</i> studentu treba biti pružena prilika da nauči računarstvo
    koje mu/joj pomaže naučiti vještinu rješavanje problema, logike i kreativnosti.
    Počevši rano, studenti će imati temelj za uspjeh u bilo kojoj karijeri 21-og vijeka.
    Vidjeti dodatne statistike <a href='%{stats_url}'> ovdje</a>."
  hoc_faq_why_cs_a_markdown: _Every_ student should have the opportunity to learn
    computer science. It helps nurture problem-solving skills, logic and creativity.
    By starting early, students will have a foundation for success in any 21st-century
    career path. See more stats [here](%{stats_url}).
  hoc_faq_how_participate_q: Kako da sudjelujem u Satu Kodiranja?
  hoc_faq_how_participate_a: "<a href='/how-to'> Počnite planirati ovdje</a> tako
    sto cete pregledati naš kako-da vodič. Možete organizirati Sat Kodiranja u školi
    ili u zajednici &mdash; u sklopu kluba izvannastavnih aktivnosti, neprofitne organizacije
    ili posla. Ili, samo ga pokušajte sami kada %{campaign_date} dođe."
  hoc_faq_how_participate_a_markdown: "[Start planning here](%{howto}) by reviewing
    our how-to guide. You can organize an Hour of Code event at your school or in
    your community — like in an extracurricular club, non-profit or at work. Or, just
    try it yourself when %{campaign_date} arrives."
  hoc_faq_behind_hoc_q: Ko stoji iza Sata Kodiranja?
  hoc_faq_behind_hoc_a: Sat Kodiranja je upravljan od strane Sata Kodiranja i Sedmice
    Edukacije Računarstva <a href='%{partner_url}'> Savjetodavnih i Raspravnih Odbora</a>
    i vrlo bitnih koalicionih partnera koji zajedničkim naporima podržavaju Sat Kodiranja
    &mdash; uključujući Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Boys and Girls Clubs of America
    i College Board.
  hoc_faq_behind_hoc_a_markdown: The Hour of Code is driven by the Hour of Code and
    Computer Science Education Week [Advisory and Review Committees](%{partner_url})
    as well as an unprecedented coalition of partners that have come together to support
    the Hour of Code — including Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Boys and Girls Clubs of
    America and the College Board.
  hoc_faq_host_q: Ne znam ništa o kodiranju. Mogu li ipak biti domaćin događaja?
  hoc_faq_host_a: Naravno. Sat Kodiranja aktivnosti su samo-vođeni. Sve što morate
    učiniti je <a href='%{codeorg_url}/learn'> probati naše trenutne tutorijale</a>,
    odabrati tutorijal koji želite, i odabrati vrijeme &mdash; mi ćemo se pobrinuti
    za ostalo. Također imamo opcije za svaku dob i razinu iskustva, od vrtića pa gore.
    Počnite planirati svoj događaj čitajući naš <a href='/how-to'> kako-da vodič</a>.
  hoc_faq_host_a_markdown: Of course. Hour of Code activities are self-guided. All
    you have to do is [try our current tutorials](%{codeorg_url}/learn), pick the
    tutorial you want, and pick an hour — we take care of the rest. We also have options
    for every age and experience-level, from kindergarten and up. Start planning your
    event by reading our [how to guide](%{howto}).
  hoc_faq_devices_q: Koje uređaje trebam koristiti za svoje studente?
  hoc_faq_devices_a: Code.org tutorijali rade na svih uređajima i preglednicima. Možete
    vidjeti više informacija o tehničkim potrebama Code.org tutorijala <a href='%{codeorg_url}/educate/it'>
    ovdje</a>. Tehnološki zahtjevi za tutorijale koji nisu Code.org se nalaze na <a
    href='%{codeorg_url}/learn'>%{partner_url}/learn</a> stranici specifičnom za određeni
    tutorijal. Ne zaboravite također nudimo <a href='%{unplugged_url}'> unplugged
    aktivnosti</a> ako vaša škola ne može omogućiti tutorijal!
  hoc_faq_devices_a_markdown: Code.org tutorials work on all devices and browsers.
    You can see more information about Code.org's tutorial tech needs [here](%{codeorg_url}/educate/it).
    Tech needs for non-Code.org tutorials can be found on [%{partner_url}/learn](%{codeorg_url}/learn)
    in the tutorial specific description. Don't forget we also offer [unplugged activities](%{unplugged_url})

  hoc_faq_need_computers_q: Da li trebam kompjuter za svakog sudionika?
  hoc_faq_need_computers_a: Ne. Imamo Sad Kodiranja tutorijale koji rade na kompjuterima,
    pametnim telefonima, tabletima, a neki uopće ne zahtijevaju upotrebu kompjutera!
    Možete se pridružiti gdje god da ste, sa bilo kojim uređajem. <p><i>Evo nekoliko

  hoc_faq_need_computers_a_markdown: |-
    No. We have Hour of Code tutorials that work on PCs, smartphones, tablets, and some that require no computer at all! You can join wherever you are, with whatever you have.

    _Here are a few options:_

    - **Work in pairs.** [Research shows](%{pair_programming_research}) students learn best with [pair programming](%{pair_programming_video}), sharing a computer and working together. Encourage your students to double up.
    - **Use a projected screen.** If you have a projector and screen for a Web-connected computer, your entire group can do an Hour of Code together. Watch video portions together and take turns solving puzzles or answering questions.
    - **Go unplugged.** We offer [tutorials that require no computer](%{unplugged_url}) at all.
  hoc_faq_international_q: Ja sam u <country>. Kako da sudjelujem međunarodno?
  hoc_faq_international_a: Sat Kodiranja može organizovati svatko, bilo gdje u svijetu.
    Prošle godine, studenti diljem svijeta pridružili su se Satu Kodiranja. Saznajte
    više <a href='target-resources'>ovdje</a>.
  hoc_faq_international_a_markdown: Anyone can organize an Hour of Code event, anywhere
    in the world. Last year, students worldwide joined together for the Hour of Code.
    Find out more [here](%{promote}).
  hoc_faq_tutorial_q: Kako ja mogu napraviti tutorijal za Sat Kodiranja?
  hoc_faq_tutorial_a: Ako ste zainteresirani da postanete suradnik u izradi vodiča,
    <a href='/tutorial-guidelines'> pogledajte naše smjernice i upute</a>. Htjeli
    bismo omogućiti razne opcije, ali primarni cilj je optimizirati iskustvo za učenike
    i učitelje kojima je računarstvo nepoznato.
  hoc_faq_tutorial_a_markdown: If you're interested in becoming a tutorial partner,
    [see our guidelines and instructions](%{tutorial_guidelines}). We'd like to host
    a variety of engaging options, but the primary goal is to optimize the experience
    for students and teachers who are new to computer science.
  hoc_faq_account_q: Trebaju li se učenici prijaviti putem računa?
  hoc_faq_account_a: Ne. Registracija ili prijava uopće nisu obvezni kako bi učenik
    iskušao Sat Kodiranja. Većina <a href='%{codeorg_url}/learn/beyond'> naknadnih
    kurseva</a> zahtijeva stvaranje računa kako bi se pohranio učenikov napredak.
    Također, registracija za Sat Kodiranja NEĆE automatski stvoriti račun za Code
    Studio. Ako želite otvoriti račune za svoje učenike, slijedite ove <a href='https://youtu.be/_smelV_KISE'>
    upute</a>.
  hoc_faq_account_a_markdown: No. Absolutely no signup or login is required for students
    to try the Hour of Code. Most of the [follow-on courses](%{codeorg_url}/learn/beyond)
    require account creation to save student progress. Also, signing up for the Hour
    of Code does NOT automatically create a Code Studio account. If you do want to
    create accounts for your students, please follow these [instructions](https://youtu.be/_smelV_KISE).
  hoc_faq_high_school_q: Koje aktivnosti bih trebao/la raditi sa srednjoškolcima?
  hoc_faq_high_school_a: Naš novi Star Wars i Minecraft tutorijal odlični su za srednjoškolce,
    naročito Star Wars JavaScript verzije i razina sa slobodnom igrom na oba tutorijala.
    Također, preporučujemo da za početak isprobate i jedan od početničkih tutorijala
    na <a href='%{codeorg_url}/learn'>%{partner_url}/learn</a>, kao što su Angry Birds
    tutorijal ili tutorijal sa Annom i Elsom. Srednjoškolac bi trebao biti u mogućnosti
    završiti jedan od ovih tutorijala u 30 minuta i tada pokušati naprednije tutorijale
    u JavaScript-u, poput Khan Academy ili CodeHS.
  hoc_faq_high_school_a_markdown: Our Star Wars and Minecraft tutorials are great
    for high schoolers, especially the Star Wars JavaScript version and the free play
    level on both tutorials. Alternately, we recommend trying one of the beginner
    tutorials on [%{partner_url}/learn](%{codeorg_url}/learn) to start, such as the
    tutorial with Angry Birds or with Anna and Elsa. A high school student should
    be able to finish one of these in 30 minutes and can then try a more advanced
    tutorial in JavaScript, such as Khan Academy or CodeHS.
  hoc_faq_scratch_q: Na Satu Kodiranja ću koristit Scratch, ali što ako moji učenici
    koriste iPad umjesto laptopa?
  hoc_faq_scratch_a: Scratch se ne može pokrenuti na tabletima. Ako su vaši učenici
    mlađi, mogu koristiti ScratchJR iPad aplikaciju (za učenike koji su tek naučili
    čitati). Ako pogledate vodiče na <a href='%{codeorg_url}/learn'>%{partner_url}/learn</a>,
    možete pronaći vodiče koji rade na iPadu - od Code.org-a, Tynker-a, Lightbot-a
    ili CodeSpark-a.
  hoc_faq_scratch_a_markdown: Scratch doesn't run on tablets. If your students are
    young, they can use the ScratchJR iPad app (for early-readers). If you look at
    the tutorials on [%{partner_url}/learn](%{codeorg_url}/learn), you can find other
    tutorials that work on iPads - from Code.org, Tynker, Lightbot, or CodeSpark.
  hoc_faq_count_hoc_q: Kako brojite Sate Kodiranja?
  hoc_faq_map_q: Zašto ne vidim svoju tačku na mapi?
  hoc_faq_map_a: Jako nam je žao što ne vidite Vaš događaj na mapi Sata Kodiranja.
    Zbog desetina hiljada organizatora koji se prijavljuju, mapa sažima podatke i
    prikazuje jednu točku za nekoliko događaja. Klikom na broj iznad karte biti ćete
    usmjereni na popis svih događaja prema državi i moći ćete pronaći sve događaja
    navedene ondje. Dodatno, s obzirom na hiljade ljudi koji se prijavljuju za Sat
    Kodiranja, popis mapa i događaja obično zahtijeva 48 sati za ažuriranje. Provjerite
    opet za nekoliko dana!
  hoc_faq_map_a_markdown: We're so sorry you aren't seeing your event on the Hour
    of Code map. Because of the tens of thousands of organizers who sign up, the map
    aggregates the data and displays one point for several events. If you click the
    [events page](%{events_url}) link below the map you will be directed to a list
    of all events by state and can find your event listed there. Additionally, given
    the thousands of people signing up for the Hour of Code, the map and event list
    usually takes 48 hours to update. Check back in a few days!
  hoc_faq_count_hoc_a: Sistem koji prati Sata Kodiranja nije 100% precizan što znači
    da ne brojimo jedinstvene ID učenika savršeno, pogotovo stoga što ne zahtijevamo
    ni prijavu niti registraciju studenata. To znači da u isti mah sudionike pre-brojavamo
    i pod-brojavamo. Pročitajte sve detalje <a href='%{codeorg_url}/loc'>ovdje</a>.
  hoc_faq_count_hoc_a_markdown: The Hour of Code tracker isn't an exact measurement
    of usage. We do not count unique student IDs perfectly when tracking participation
    in the Hour of Code, especially because we don't require students to log in or
    register. As a result, we both over-count and under-count participants at the
    same time. Read all the details [here](%{codeorg_url}/loc).
  hoc_faq_one_hour_q: Koliko se zapravo može naučiti za sat vremena?
  hoc_faq_one_hour_a: Cilj Sata kodiranja nije naučiti svakoga kako postati ekspert
    računalni naučnik u sat vremena. Sat vremena dovoljno je za shvatiti kako je računarstvo
    zabavno i kreativno, te da je dostupno svim uzrastima, za sve učenike, bez obzira
    na njihovu pozadinu. Mjera uspjeha ove kampanje nije u tome koliko su učenici
    računarstva naučili nego se uspjeh ogleda u širokom sudjelovanju bez obzira na
    spol, etničku i socijalnu razlikost grupa, te i povećanom upisu i sudjelovanju
    u informatičkim kursevima na svim razinama. Milijuni učitelja i učenika odlučili
    su učiti i više od jednog sata - učiti cijeli dan, čitavu sedmicu ili duže, a
    kao rezultat toga mnogi su učenici odlučili upisati cijeli kurs (ili čak kolegij
    na fakultetu). <br/> <br/> Osim učenika, još jedan "učenik" je i nastavnik koji
    nakon jednog sata stječe samopouzdanje za podučavanje informatike iako nema diplomu
    informatičara. Deseci tisuća nastavnika odlučili su dodatno učiti informatiku,
    ili pohađaju dodatne kurseve ili nude pohađenje online kurseva, ili oboje. To
    vrijedi i za školske administratore koji shvaćaju da je računarstvo nešto što
    učenici žele i da su njihovi nastavnici u stanju predavati. <br/> <br/> Iznad
    svega, ono što svi sudionici mogu naučiti u sat vremena jest da ovo svi možemo.
  hoc_faq_one_hour_a_markdown: |-
    The goal of the Hour of Code is not to teach anybody to become an expert computer scientist in one hour. One hour is only enough to learn that computer science is fun and creative, that it is accessible at all ages, for all students, regardless of background. The measure of success of this campaign is not in how much CS students learn - the success is reflected in broad participation across gender and ethnic and socioeconomic groups, and the resulting increase in enrollment and participation we see in CS courses at all grade levels. Millions of the participating teachers and students have decided to go beyond one hour -  to learn for a whole day or a whole week or longer, and many students have decided to enroll in a whole course (or even a college major) as a result.

    Besides the students, another "learner" is the educator who gains the confidence after one hour that they can teach computer science even though they may not have a college degree as a computer scientist. Tens of thousands of teachers decide to pursue computer science further, either attending PD or offering follow-on online courses, or both. And this applies to school administrators too, who realize that computer science is something their students want and their teachers are capable of.

    Above all, what all participants can learn in an hour is that we can do this.
