The Hour of Code is driven by the Hour of Code and Computer Science Education Week Advisory and Review Committees.

The [Advisory Committee]({{ urls/advisory_committee }}) is composed of representatives from K-12, academia, nonprofits, for-profits, and international organizations. Ovaj komitet vodi strategiju za kampanju Časa Kodiranja.

The [Review Committee]({{ urls/review_committee }}) is composed of 15 educators across K-12 grade bands that assess and recommend activities using the Advisory Committee's rubric. These educators review student-led activities and teacher-led lesson plans submitted by hundreds of activity partners, evaluating the activities' educational value, ability to engage learners, and potential appeal to diverse sets of students.

Rad i posvećenost oba komiteta je doprinijela uspjehu Časa Kodiranja i njegova vizija pružanja uvoda u računarstvo za svakog učenika.
