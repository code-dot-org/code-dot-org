# How to do an Hour of Code with your child

### Complete an Hour of Code at home or volunteer to bring it to your child’s classroom!

## 1) Pogledaj ovaj kako-da video <iframe width="500" height="255" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/SrnvvWDm73k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen mark="crwd-mark"></iframe> 

## 2) Choose a tutorial

We provide a variety of fun, hour-long tutorials for students of all ages, created by a variety of partners. [Try them out!]({{ urls/learn }})

**All Hour of Code tutorials are self-guided - allowing your child to work at their own pace and skill level**

## 3) Planirajte Vaše tehnološke potrebe

The best Hour of Code experience will be with Internet-connected computers. But you **don’t** need a computer. There are many activities that are "unplugged" and can be done without any technology at all. Test tutorials on your computer or device. Make sure they work properly on browsers with sound and video.

**Want to learn alongside your child?** Try [pair programming.](http://www.ncwit.org/resources/pair-programming-box-power-collaborative-learning) Computer science is social and collaborative.

## 4) Start your Hour of Code with an inspiring video

Započni svoj Čas Kodiranja inspirirajući svoje dijete i diskutujte kako računarstvo utječe na svaki dio naših života.

**Pokaži inspiracioni video:**

- The original Code.org launch video, featuring Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and NBA star Chris Bosh (there are [1 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYZF6oIZtfc), [5 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc), and [9 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1xS07N-FA) versions).
- The [Hour of Code Worldwide video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsOIlDT145A).
- [Presjednik Obama poziva sve učenike da nauče računarstvo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvmhE1J9PY).
- Find more inspirational [resources]({{ urls/inspire }}) and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNfpD8i4Sx7U0y2MccnrNZuP).

It’s okay if both you and your child are brand new to computer science. Here are some ideas to introduce your Hour of Code activity:

- Explain ways technology impacts our lives, with examples both boys and girls will care about (Talk about saving lives, helping people, connecting people, etc.).
- List things that use code in everyday life.
- See tips for getting girls interested in computer science [here]({{ urls/girls }}).

## 5) Code!

Kada izaberete tutorijal koji biste željeli raditi, možete označiti kratki link tutorijala.

**Kada Vaše dijete naiđe na poteškoće**

Uredu je odgovoriti:

- "Ne znam. Hajdemo ovo riješiti zajedno."
- "Tehnologija nije uvijek onakva kavu mi želimo."
- “Learning to program is like learning a new language; you won’t be fluent right away.”

## 6) Slaviti

[Print certificates]({{ urls/certificates }}) for your child (and yourself!).

Share photos and videos of your Hour of Code event on social media. Use #HourOfCode and @codeorg so we can highlight your success, too!

Review the [Hour of Code FAQ](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/categories/200147083-Hour-of-Code) if you still have questions.

## Šta dolazi poslije Časa Kodiranja?

The Hour of Code is just the first step in a journey to learn more about how technology works and how to create software applications. To continue this journey:

- Encourage your child to continue [to learn online]({{ urls/learn_beyond }}).
