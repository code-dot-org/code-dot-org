<br /> **The Hour of Code runs during {{ campaign_date/full }} and we'll be in touch about new tutorials and other exciting updates as they come out. In the meantime, what can you do now?**

As a special thank you to Hour of Code organizers, we have a new poster set featuring Malala, Stephen Curry, Shakira and more available to order at a [50% discount from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/promocode/A3QAYNZUZTSSNQ). This year, each set comes with 6 posters and 126 "I did the Hour of Code" stickers. With the discount you'll get them for less than our cost to make them. Supplies are limited, so order your posters soon. If you're not in the United States, you can [download and print all posters]({{ promote/promote_posters_url }}).

Recruit a local group — boy/girl scouts club, church, university, veterans group, labor union, or even some friends. You don't have to be in school to learn new skills. Invite a local politician or policy maker to visit your school for the Hour of Code. It can help build support for computer science in your area beyond one hour.

Use these [posters, banners, stickers, videos and more]({{ promote/resources }}) for your own event.
