## Cara menarik untuk menarik perhatian media terhadap Kegiatan Hour of Code anda

*For all press and media inquiries, contact <press@code.org>*

### Tips

- Hubungi media dua minggu sebelum kegiatan melalui email. Tindaklanjuti dengan email dan telepon jika belum menerima respon awal.
- Minta staff sekolah atau sukarelawan untuk mengambil foto untuk dibagikan atau dikirim kepada pers.
- Tuliskan mengenai Hour of Code pada homepage website anda dan pada koran sekolah anda. Posting rincian kegiatan anda, dan gambar dari aktivitas pelajar.
- On Facebook and Twitter, share updates on your plans, announce your events and post pictures during Dec. 5-11. Use the hashtag **#HourOfCode** so Code.org can see and promote your events.

### Panduan langkah demi langkah:

**1. Plan your event**

- Rencanakan pertemuan awal Hour of Code anda.
- Kirim [surat](%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#sample-emails') %) kepada orang tua. Minta mereka untuk menyebarkan berita.
- Kirim [surat](%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#sample-emails') %) untuk mengundang walikota Anda, anggota kongres, gubernur atau pebisnis berpengaruh untuk menghadiri dan berbicara kepada murid-murid Anda.
- Selengarakan aktivitas kelompok(seperti melakukan aktivitas tanpa perangkat keras). atau pamerkan apa yang dibuat pelajar dan aktivitasnya.
- Menunjukkan [video Hour of Code ](%= resolve_url('/') %)dari Code.org atau salah satu dari [ini](%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#videos') %) untuk menginspirasi.

**2. Identify specific local reporters that cover education or local events.**

Think a local newspaper, TV station, radio station or blog.

Look online to find reporter contact information. If you can't find it, call the publication to ask, or email a general tips@PUBLICATIONNAME.com email address and ask for your message to be directed to the correct reporter.

**3. Contact local media**

The best way to reach out is by email. It should be short and communicate: why should other people care about this event? Include contact information (including a cellphone number) for who will be on site at the event. **See a [sample pitch to media](%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#sample-emails') %).**

**4. Prepare to field questions about your school event. Here are some examples:**

*Why is your school doing an Hour of Code?*

While all of us know that it’s important for students to learn how to navigate today’s tech-saturated world, many teachers aren’t experienced in computer science and don’t know where to start. This event is a chance for all of us to see what computer science is about.

We hope it’ll spark interest in students to keep learning. Research also shows that kids can pick up programming concepts before they know how to read and write. In fact, their brains are more receptive to computer languages at a young age, just like foreign languages.

*Why is this important?*

Technology is transforming every industry on the planet. In 2015, 7 million openings in the U.S. were in occupations—including art and design—that value coding skills. But 75 percent of schools in the U.S. don't teach computer science. It’s time for us to catch up to the 21st century. We know that regardless of what our students do when they grow up, whether they go into medicine, business, politics, or the arts, knowing how to build technology will give them confidence and a competitive edge.

**More details and a quote you can use in materials**

"The Hour of Code is designed to demystify code and show that computer science is not rocket science—anybody can learn the basics," said Hadi Partovi, founder and CEO of Code.org. "Over 100 million students worldwide have tried an Hour of Code. The demand for relevant 21st century computer science education crosses all borders and knows no boundaries."

**About Code.org**

Code.org is a 501c3 public non-profit dedicated to expanding participation in computer science and increasing participation by women and underrepresented students of color. Its vision is that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer programming. After launching in 2013, Code.org organized the Hour of Code campaign – which has introduced over 100 million students to computer science to date – and partnered with 70 public school districts nationwide to expand computer science programs. Code.org is supported by philanthropic donations from corporations, foundations and generous individuals, including Microsoft, Infosys Foundation, USA, The Ballmer Family Giving, Omidyar Network and others.
