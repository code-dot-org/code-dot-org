## Membawa Hour of Code ke seluruh komunitas Anda.

### Buat semua sekolah berpartisipasi, setiap pelajar harus mempelajarinya!

  1. **Merekrut daerah dan sekolah-sekolah setempat.** Menggunakan [ atau <a href="<%= hoc_uri('/resources/stats') %>" mengatakan uraian ini](<%= hoc_uri('/resources#sample-emails') %>) sebagai awal titik, dan lihatlah ini  sekolah dan Kabupaten. Let them know **every** participating educator will receive a [thank you gift](<%= hoc_uri('/resources/how-to') %>) and in **each state**, one participating school will win **$10,000 in technology**!</p></li> 
    
      * **Host an Hour of Code event.** See our [event how-to guide](<%= hoc_uri('/resources/how-to-event') %>) for a sample run of show, media outreach kit and other event-planning resources. Hosting an event is a great way to promote the Hour of Code and increase participation.
    
      * **Attend an event during Computer Science Education Week (Dec 7-13).** [Find classrooms and schools](<%= hoc_uri('/events') %>) participating in your district, city or state.
    
      * **Issue a proclamation or resolution.** See this [sample resolution](<%= hoc_uri('resources/proclamation') %>) supportive of Computer Science Education Week and its goals that could be used by state and local legislators.
    
      * **Draft an op-ed**. Consider publishing an opinion piece in your local paper. See this [sample op-ed](<%= hoc_uri('/resources/op-ed') %>) supporting comupter supportive of Computer Science Education Week and its goals.
    
      * **Spread the word.** [Share the Hour of Code video on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fhourofcode.com%2Fus) and [talk about your support on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhourofcode.com&text=I%27m%20participating%20in%20this%20year%27s%20%23HourOfCode%2C%20are%20you%3F%20%40codeorg&original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fq%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Ftwitter.com%252Fshare%253Fhashtags%253D%2526amp%253Brelated%253Dcodeorg%2526amp%253Btext%253DI%252527m%252Bparticipating%252Bin%252Bthis%252Byear%252527s%252B%252523HourOfCode%25252C%252Bare%252Byou%25253F%252B%252540codeorg%2526amp%253Burl%253Dhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fhourofcode.com%26sa%3DD%26sntz%3D1%26usg%3DAFQjCNE1GLTUbKZfMlEh9Aj5w0iswz6PYQ&related=codeorg&hashtags=).
