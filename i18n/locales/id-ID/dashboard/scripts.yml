Pasang bagaimana bisa mengeksplorasi komputer menggunakan lokasi sprite dan ukuran sifat dan matematika untuk mendeteksi apakah dua sprite yang menyentuh. Kelas kemudian menyentuh menggunakan blok() untuk menciptakan efek yang berbeda ketika sprite bertabrakan, termasuk bermain suara. Terakhir, mereka menggunakan keterampilan baru untuk meningkatkan sisi scroller permainan yang mereka mulai di pelajaran yang lalu.
              description_teacher: Students learn about collision detection on the computer.  Working in pairs, they explore how a computer could use sprite location and size properties and math to detect whether two sprites are touching.  They then use the `isTouching()` block to create different effects when sprites collide, including playing sounds.  Last, they use their new skills to improve the sidescroller game that they started in the last lesson.
            Complex Sprite Movement:

              description_student: 'Kelas belajar untuk menggabungkan kecepatan sifat sprite dengan melawan pola untuk membuat gerakan sprite yang lebih kompleks, seperti simulasi gravitasi, membuat sprite melompat, dan memungkinkan mengabung sprite kiri atau kanan. Di tingkat akhir kelas menggabungkan gerakan-gerakan ini untuk menghidupkan dan mengontrol satu sprite dan membangun sebuah permainan sederhana di mana karakter terbang di sekitar dan mengumpulkan koin. '
              description_teacher: Students learn to combine the velocity properties of sprites with the counter pattern to create more complex sprite movement. In particular students will learn how to simulate gravity, make a sprite jump, and allow a sprite to float left or right. In the final levels of the Code Studio progression students combine these movements to animate and control a single sprite and build a simple game in which a character flies around and collects a coin. Students are encouraged to make their own additions to the game in the final level.

            Functions:
              name: Fungsi
              description_student: This lesson covers functions as a way to organize their code, make it more readable, and remove repeated blocks of code. The class learns that higher level or more abstract steps make it easier to understand and reason about steps, then begins to create functions in Game Lab.  At the end of the lesson the class uses these skills to organize and add functionality to the final version of their side scroller game.
              description_teacher: Students learn how to create functions to organize their code, make it more readable, and remove repeated blocks of code. An unplugged warmup explores how directions at different levels of detail can be useful depending on context. Students learn that higher level or more abstract steps make it easier to understand and reason about steps. Afterwards students learn to create functions in Game Lab. They will use functions to remove long blocks of code from their draw loop and to replace repeated pieces of code with a single function.

            Shapes and Randomness:
              name: Bentuk dan keserampangan
              description_student: This lesson extends the drawing skills to include width and height and introduces the concept of random number generation. The class learns to draw with versions of ellipse() and rect() that include width and height parameters and to use the background() block to fill the screen with color. At the end of the progression the class is introduced to the randomNumber() block and uses the new blocks to draw a randomized rainbow snake.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students continue to develop their drawing skills. At the beginning of the lesson a teacher-led discussion connects expanded block functionality (e.g. different sized shapes) with the need for more block inputs, or "parameters". Students learn to draw with versions of `ellipse()` and `rect()` that include width and height parameters. They also learn to use the `background()` block. At the end of the progression students are introduced to the `randomNumber()` block. Combining all of these skills students will draw a randomized rainbow snake at the end of the lesson.
            Variables:
              name: Variabel
              description_student: Pelajaran ini memperkenalkan variabel sebagai cara untuk label nomor pada sebuah program atau menyimpan nilai secara acak. Kelas dimulai pelajaran dengan deskripsi dasar dari tujuan variabel dan praktek menggunakan blok baru. Setelah itu, kelas ini menggunakan variabel untuk menyimpan nomor acak, yang memungkinkan program untuk menggunakan nomor acak beberapa kali.
              description_teacher: Dalam pelajaran ini siswa belajar bagaimana menggunakan variabel untuk label nomor dalam program mereka atau menyimpan nilai secara acak. Siswa memulai pelajaran dengan deskripsi dasar dari tujuan dari sebuah variabel. Siswa kemudian menyelesaikan tingkat perkembangan yang memperkuat model variabel sebagai cara untuk label atau nama nomor. Siswa menggunakan variabel untuk menyimpan nomor acak untuk melihat bahwa variabel-variabel yang benar-benar menyimpan atau menyimpan nilai-nilai mereka, yang memungkinkan mereka untuk sama-sama menggunakan nomor acak beberapa kali dalam program-program mereka.
            Sprites:
              name: Sprites
              description_student: Dalam rangka untuk membuat lebih menarik dan lengkap gambar, kelas diperkenalkan ke objek sprite. Setiap sprite dapat ditugaskan gambar untuk menunjukkan, dan sprite juga melacak beberapa nilai-nilai tentang diri mereka sendiri, yang akan berguna di jalan, ketika membuat animasi. Di akhir pelajaran, semua orang membuat adegan menggunakan sprite.
              description_teacher: In order to create more interesting and detailed images, students are introduced to the sprite object. Every sprite can be assigned an image to show, and sprites also keep track of multiple values about themselves, which will prove useful down the road when making animations.
            The Draw Loop:
              name: The Draw Loop
              description_student: This lesson introduces the draw loop, one of the core programming paradigms in Game Lab.  The class combines the draw loop with random numbers to manipulate some simple animations with dots and then with sprites. Afterwards, everyone uses what they learned to update the sprite scene from the previous lesson.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students are introduced to the draw loop, one of the core programming paradigms in Game Lab. To begin the lesson students look at some physical flipbooks to see that having many frames with different images creates the impression of motion. Students then watch a video explaining how the draw loop in Game Lab helps to create this same impression in their programs. Students combine the draw loop with random numbers to manipulate some simple animations with dots and then with sprites. At the end of the lesson students use what they learned to update their sprite scene from the previous lesson.
            The Counter Pattern Unplugged:
              name: The Counter Pattern Unplugged
              description_student: This unplugged lesson explores the underlying behavior of variables.

            Conditionals:
              name: Kondisi
              description_student: The class starts by using booleans to compare the current value of a sprite property with a target value, using that comparison to determine when a sprite has reached a point on the screen, grown to a given size, or otherwise reached a value using the counter pattern. After using booleans directly to investigate the values or sprite properties, the class adds conditional if statements to write code that responds to those boolean comparisons.

            Booleans Unplugged:
              name: Booleans dicabut
              description_student: Pelajaran ini memperkenalkan nilai-nilai boolean dan logika, serta pernyataan bersyarat. Kelas dimulai dengan bermain game sederhana dari Berdiri, Duduk di mana boolean (benar/palsu) pernyataan yang menggambarkan sifat-sifat pribadi (rambut atau warna mata, jenis pakaian, usia, dll). Kelas, kemudian kelompok benda berdasarkan semakin kompleks pernyataan boolean, kemudian melihat bagaimana dapat bersyarat mempengaruhi aliran program.
              description_teacher: |-
                In this lesson, students are introduced to boolean values and logic, as well as conditional statements. The class starts by playing a simple game of Stand Up, Sit Down in which the boolean (true/false) statements describe personal properties (hair or eye color, clothing type, age, etc). This gets students thinking about how they can frame a property with multiple potential values (such as age) with a binary question.
                
                From there students are provided a group of objects with similar, yet varying, physical properties. With a partner they group those objects based on increasingly complex boolean statements, including compound booleans with AND and OR.
                
                Finally we reveal Conditionals as a tool to make decisions or impact the flow of a program using boolean statements as input.

              description_teacher: Students will plan and build their own game using the project guide from the previous two lessons to guide their project. Working individually or in pairs, students will first decide on the type of game they'd like to build, taking as inspiration a set of sample games. They will then complete a blank project guide where they will describe the game's behavior and scope out the variables, sprites, and functions they'll need to build. In Code Studio, a series of levels prompts them on a general sequence they can use to implement this plan. Partway through the process, students will share their projects for peer review and will incorporate feedback as they finish their game. At the end of the lesson, students will share their completed games with their classmates. This project will span multiple classes and can easily take anywhere from 3-5 class periods.

              description_teacher: This lesson introduces the formal problem solving process that students will use over the course of the year, Define - Prepare - Try - Reflect. The lesson begins by asking students to brainstorm all the different types of problems that they encounter in everyday life. Students are then shown the four steps of the problem solving process and work together to relate these abstract steps to their actual experiences solving problems. First students relate these steps to the aluminum boats problem from the previous lesson, then a problem they are good at solving, then a problem they want to improve at solving. At the end of the lesson the class collects a list of generally useful strategies for each step of the process to put on posters that will be used throughout the unit and year.

                In this lesson students apply the problem solving process to three different problems in order to better understand the value of each step. They will solve a word search, arrange seating for a birthday party, and plan a trip. The problems grow increasingly complex and poorly defined to highlight how the problem solving process is particularly helpful when tackling these types of problems. The lesson concludes with students reflecting on their experience with the problem solving process. They will justify the inclusion of each step and will brainstorm questions or strategies that can help them better define open-ended problems, as this is often the most critical step.
                
                This lesson will likely take two class periods or more to complete. The first two problems may fit into a single class period but the third will need to be moved to a second day.

After brainstorming the possible definitions for a computer, the class works in groups to sort pictures into “is a computer” or “is not a computer” on poster paper and explain their motivations for choosing some of the most difficult categorizations.  The teacher then introduces a definition of the computer and allows groups to revise their posters according to the new definition.

Kelompok-kelompok yang ditugaskan untuk sebuah perangkat komputasi dan didasarkan pada guru-disediakan definisi masukan dan keluaran, daftar masukan dan keluaran dari perangkat mereka. Untuk menyimpulkan pelajaran kelas meneliti umum kegiatan-kegiatan yang mereka lakukan pada perangkat komputasi dan pilih masukan dan keluaran yang digunakan untuk kegiatan itu dari grafik.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students consider a number of computing devices to determine what types of inputs and outputs they use. Groups are assigned to a computing device and based on a teacher-provided definition of input and output, list the inputs and outputs of their device. Earlier in the activity students are prompted to focus on more obvious physical inputs and outputs (e.g. a keyboard as an input or a screen as an output) but later discussions lead students to consider less obvious examples (e.g. that a touch screen is both an input and output, or the fact that the Internet can serve as both input and output). Throughout the lesson the teacher records inputs and outputs that are identified on a T-Chart at the front of the room. To conclude the lesson students examine common activities they do on a computing device and select the inputs and outputs used for that activity from the chart.
            Processing:
              name: Sedang memproses
              description_student: This lesson dives deeper into the concept of processing that was introduced as part of the definition of a computer.  Pairs work together to puta deck of cards in order, a form of processing information.  In the end, the class discusses what processing means within the context of solving information problems.
              description_teacher: Students complete two unplugged card sorting activities to explore the meaning of processing and its relationship to problem-solving. The first has few constraints and is used to introduce a high-level definition of processing. The next introduces more constraints that forces students to develop an algorithm that will always successfully process the cards. Students iteratively develop, test, and share their algorithms with classmates. A wrap-up discussion has students reflect on the different types of problem-solving they used in these activities and the value of producing an algorithm to solve a problem.

Pelajaran ditutup dengan diskusi pentingnya penyimpanan sementara pengolahan informasi.
              description_teacher: Students explore the importance of storage within the Input-Storage-Processing-Output model of a computer. The warm-up activity asks students to reflect on the types of information they have seen computers store in the past, like documents, photographs, or videos. The unplugged main activity has students develop an algorithm to process a small pile of cards in search of specific cards within the deck. Constraints on how students can move the cards force them to consider the importance of storage even while they are processing the deck. The lesson concludes with a discussion of the two types of storage students saw in this lesson and the importance of storage while processing information.

              description_teacher: "As students have recently spent some time thinking about the actual content that will go into their personal website, this lesson takes a step back from the unit-long project (publication of a personal website) to help students articulate what personal information they choose to share digitally and with whom.  It also reinforces the notion that much of the information that they choose to share digitally falls largely out of their control the moment it is released.  \\r\n\\r\nStudents begin by individually identifying appropriate audiences with whom they would be comfortable sharing given pieces of personal information.  They then look at several social media pages to determine what sorts of information people are sharing about themselves or one another.  Last, students reflect on what guidelines they think are appropriate for posting information online.\\r\n\\r\nThe ultimate point of this lesson is not to scare students, but rather to experientially bring students to realizing precisely what level of control they don’t have in releasing information into the web."

          description_short: "  Learn how to design a program that meets the needs of your users."
          description: Unit 4 introduces the broader social impacts of computing. Through a series of design challenges, you will learn how to better understand the needs of others while developing a solution to a problem. The second half of the unit consists of an iterative team project, during which teams have the opportunity to identify a need that they care about, prototype solutions both on paper and in App Lab, and test solutions with real users to get feedback and drive further iteration.
          stages:
            Analysis of Design:
              name: Analisis desain
              description_student: The class explores a variety of different teapot designs to consider how design choices or made and why. Using the teapots as an example, the class will explore the relationship between users, their needs, and the design of objects they use.
              description_teacher: To kick off a unit devoted to group problem solving and developing products for other users, students begin by investigating the design of various teapots. Students analyze each teapot, attempting to identify how specific user needs might have informed its design. By considering these design choices, and attempting to match each teapot with a potential user, students can begin to see how taking a user-centered approach to designing products (both physical and digital) can make those products more useful and usable. To conclude the activity, students are asked to propose some changes to one of the teapots that would make it more useful or usable.
            Understanding Your User:
              name: Memahami pengguna anda
              description_student: Using user profiles, the class explores how different users might react to a variety of products. Role playing as a different person, each member of the class will get to experience designs through someone else's eyes.
              description_teacher: "Designers need to understand their users’ needs in order to create useful products.  This lesson encourages students to think about how to design for another person by role-playing as someone else using a user profile and reacting as that user to a series of products.  Each student is assigned a user profile describing a person, which they then use to choose appropriate products, critique product design, and suggest improvements to design.\\r\n"
            Discovering Users:

            User-Centered Design Micro Activity:
              name: User-Centered Design Micro Activity
              description_student: In small groups, the class uses the design process to come up with ideas for smart clothing. From brainstorming, to identifying users, to finally proposing a design, this is the first of several opportunities in this unit to practicing designing a solution for the needs of others.
              description_teacher: This lesson guides students through an abbreviated version of the design process they will be seeing throughout this unit. Students first brainstorm a list of potential users of smart clothing. As a class, they then group these ideas into broad categories and each group will choose one category of user. Groups repeat this process to brainstorm needs or concerns of their user, eventually categorizing these needs and choosing one to focus on. Finally, students design a piece of smart clothing, using the specific needs and concerns they brainstormed to guide their decision making. At the end of the class students quickly share their decision-making process and get feedback on how well their product addresses the user need they selected.

              description_student: To kick off the app design project, the class organizes into teams and starts exploring app topics. Several example socially impactful apps serve as inspiration for the project.
              description_teacher: To kick off the app design project that lasts through the end of the unit, students first explore a number of apps designed for social impact that have been created by other students. The class then reviews the Define, Prepare, Try, and Reflect steps of the Problem Solving process as they develop an idea for an app of their own with social impact. Finally, students will form project teams and lay out a contract for how the team will function throughout the development of their app.
            Market Research:
              name: Meneliti pasar
              description_student: Dive into app development by exploring existing apps that may serve similar users. Each group identifies a handful of apps that address the same topic they are working on, using those apps to help refine the app idea they will pursue.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students research apps similar to the one they intend on creating to better understand the needs of their users. Students work within their teams to search the Internet for other apps, then evaluate the ones they find interesting. By the end of the lesson, each team will have a clearer idea about the type of app they want to create and further refine who their target users are. Each team will maintain a list of citations for all the apps they examined for use in their final presentation.
            Paper Prototypes:
              name: Paper Prototypes
              description_student: Paper prototypes allow developers to quickly test ideas before investing a lot of time writing code. In this lesson teams explore some example apps created in App Lab, using those apps to help inform the first paper prototypes of their apps.
              description_teacher: "Before starting to design apps, we need to help students to better scope their expectations. Because students will eventually be prototyping these apps in App Lab, they will be in better shape if their ideas align with the kinds of apps that are easily prototyped in App Lab. Teams start this scoping by looking through several example apps designed to demonstrate apps that can be created with App Lab. Teams then can chose one (or more) of the apps as a basis for their own. From there, teams have some time to discuss the basic functionality of their app before using 3x5 index cards to develop paper prototypes.\\r\n"
            Prototype Testing:
              name: Pengujian Prototipe
              description_student: In this lesson teams test out their paper prototypes with other members of the class. With one student role playing the computer, one narrating, and the rest observing, teams will get immediate feedback on their app designs which will inform the next version of their app prototypes.
              description_teacher: The primary purpose of developing paper prototypes is that they allow for quick testing and iteration before any code is written. This lesson is focused on giving teams a chance to test their prototypes before moving to App Lab. Teams develop a plan to test with users before running prototype tests with multiple other students in the class (and potentially outside the class). In order to test the prototype with the users, the students will have to assign roles in the testing (the “narrator”, the “computer” and the “observers”) as well as have some questions prepared for the user to answer after the test is complete.
            Digital Design:
              name: Digital Design
              description_student: Having developed, tested, and gathered feedback on a paper prototype, teams now move to App Lab to build the next iteration of their apps. Using the drag-and-drop Design Mode, each team member builds out at least one page of their team's app, responding to feedback that was received in the previous round of testing.
              description_teacher: Having collaboratively developed a paper prototype for their apps, groups now divide and conquer to begin work on an interactive digital version based on the paper prototype. Using the drag-and-drop design mode of App Lab, students individually work through a progression of skill-building levels to learn how to build digital versions of a paper prototype. From there, each group member builds out at least one page of their app in App Lab, to be later combined into a single app.
            Event Driven Programming:
              name: Event Driven Programming
              description_student: Building on the screens that the class designed in the previous lesson, teams combine screens into a single app. Simple code can then be added to make button clicks change to the appropriate screen.
              description_teacher: In this lesson teams combine the screens that they designed in the previous lesson into a single app, which they then begin to program using simple events. Students learn basic event driven programming by making several small apps that respond to users clicking buttons. Following that, group members share the screens they've developed and each group member imports all of the screens into their own copy of the app, which they will make interactive by connecting buttons to events.
            Basic App Functionality:
              name: Basic App Functionality
              description_student: Teams add a bit more polish and functionality to their apps before testing. Several examples are provided to demonstrate simple code that adds cool features.
              description_teacher: At this point in the development process, each student should have what is essentially a digital version of the paper prototype - static screens that are linked together with buttons. For many apps this is all you really need to start testing with users, but this lesson will give students a chance to explore simple ways to add a bit more functionality to their apps before moving into the testing phase. The programming concepts introduced in this lesson are **not necessary** to successfully complete the project, and can be omitted at your discretion.
            Testing the App:
              name: Testing the App
              description_student: Teams run another round of user testing, this time with their interactive prototype. Feedback gathered from this round of testing will inform the final iteration of the app prototypes.
              description_teacher: 'By the end of the previous lesson each team should have a minimum viable prototype of their app. The primary purpose of this lesson is to have the team actually test the app with other people, preferably from the target audience the app is intended for, or from different teams in the class while observers from the team will record the results on the worksheets they used in the planning phase. As with testing the paper prototypes, teams will start by planning for the specific scenarios before running and observing tests. '
            Improving and Iterating:
              name: Meningkatkan dan menguraikan
              description_student: Using the feedback from the last round of testing, teams implement changes that address the needs of their users. Each team tracks and prioritizes the features they want to add and the bugs they need to fix.
              description_teacher: Teams have at this point developed an app prototype that has gone through multiple iterations and rounds of user testing. With the information and guidance gained from the last round of user testing, each student has the opportunity to plan for and implement improvements to the team app. Depending on the time you have available, and student interest, you can run the cycle of testing and iteration as many times as you see fit.
            App Presentation:
              name: Penyajian aplikasi
              description_student: Each team prepares a presentation to "pitch" the app they've developed. This is the time to share struggles, triumphs, and plans for the future.
              description_teacher: At this point teams have researched a topic of personal and social importance, developed and tested both a paper prototype and a digital prototype, and iterated on the initial app to incorporate new features and bug fixes. Now is the time for them to review what they have done and pull together a coherent presentation to demonstrate their process of creation. Using the provided presentation template, teams prepare to present about their process of app development, including the problem they set out to solve, the ways in which they've incorporated feedback from testing, and their plans for the future.
            User Interface and Prototype Testing:
              name: User Interface and Prototype Testing
              description_student: See how a paper prototype can be used to test and get feedback on software before writing any code. To help out a developer with their idea, the class tests and provides an app prototype made of paper.
              description_teacher: Following the mini design project, students look towards the next phase of design - prototyping a product that attempts to address user needs. In teams, students examine a paper prototype for a chat app called "Txt Ur Grndkdz". Through using this paper prototype, students get a chance to see how a simple paper prototype can be used to quickly test ideas and assumptions before we ever get to the computer. After "using" the provided prototype students begin to identify ways to improve the next iteration.
            Feedback and Prototypes:
              name: Feedback and Prototypes
              description_student: Users have been testing an app, and they have lots of feedback for the developer. The class needs to sort through all of this feedback, identify the common themes and needs, and start revising the prototype to make it better meet the users' needs.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students use feedback from "users" of the paper-prototyped app from the previous lesson in order to develop improvements to the user interface of that paper prototype. The lesson begins with a reflection on the fact that designers need to translate human needs with technology into changes to the user interface or experience. Students are then given a collection of feedback and requests from users of the app from the previous lesson. In groups students categorize the feedback and identify ways the needs expressed in the feedback could be met by changes to the interface of the app. Then in groups students will implement some of these changes to meet one of the needs they identified.
            Identifying User Needs:
              name: Identifying User Needs
              description_student: Up to this point the users that the class has considered have all been remote, and the only information from users has come through text or role playing. Now the class will rely on each other as potential users, and pairs will get to interview each other to identify needs that could be addressed by developing an app.
              description_teacher: 'Up to this point students have focused on designing for users who are, to some degree, distanced from them. Whether through brainstorming, profiles, or text feedback, the connection to an end user has never been direct. This is distance is designed to help students get outside their own head when thinking about users, but in order to get information more directly from an actual user, students need to rely on their classmates. In this lesson students pair up to become users (and designers) for each other, allowing everyone to directly interview their end user and ask questions to better inform their design. Each student pair interviews each other, attempting to identify a specific need that could be addressed by an app. '
            Project - Paper Prototype:
              name: Project - Paper Prototype
              description_student: Using the interview information from the previous lesson, the class comes up with app ideas to address the needs of their users. To express those ideas, and test out their effectiveness, each student creates and tests paper prototypes of their own.
              description_teacher: Based on the peer interview from the previous lesson, each student comes up with an idea for an app that will address their user's problem. Students then get to create their own paper prototype of their app ideas by drawing "screens" on individual notecards. A project guide directs students through the process including building the app and testing it with their user to see if their assumptions about the user interfaces they created are accurate.
            Linking Screens:
              name: Linking Screens
              description_student: Building on the screens that the class designed in the previous lesson, teams combine screens into a single app. Simple code can then be added to make button clicks change to the appropriate screen.
              description_teacher: In this lesson teams combine the screens that they designed in the previous lesson into a single app, which they can then link together using code. Students learn basic event driven programming by building up the model app that they started in the previous lesson. In addition to the screen that students designed yesterday, they'll learn how to create additional screens and even import screens made by others.
            User Interfaces:
              name: User Interfaces
              description_student: See how a paper prototype can be used to test and get feedback on software before writing any code. To help out a developer with their idea, the class tests and provides an app prototype made of paper.

          description: Unit 6 explores the role of hardware platforms in computing and how different sensors can provide more effective input and output than the traditional keyboard, mouse, and monitor. Using App Lab and Adafruit’s Circuit Playground, you’ll develop programs that utilize the same hardware inputs and outputs that you see in the smart devices, looking at how a simple rough prototype can lead to a finished product. The unit concludes with a design challenge to use the Circuit Playground as the basis for an innovation of your own design.
          stages:
            Computing Innovations:
              name: Inovasi Komputasi
              description_student: Explore a wide variety of new and innovative computing platforms while expanding your understanding of what a computer can be.
              description_teacher: To kick off the final unit of this course, students will do some research into interesting innovations in computing. This lesson will expose students to wider variety of computing form factors (what a computer looks like) and fields that are impacted by computing. Later in this unit students will look back on the devices they encountered in this lesson as they develop their own physical computing devices.
            Input Unplugged:
              name: Input Unplugged
              description_student: Experience two different ways that an app can take input from a user, while learning more about the event-driven programming model used in App Lab.
              description_teacher: In preparation for delving deeper into programming with App Lab, students will explore how a handful of different programs written in both Game Lab and App Lab handle taking input from the user. After comparing and contrasting the approaches they saw in the example apps, students group up to act out the two different models for input (conditionals in an infinite loop and asynchronous events) to gain a better understanding of how they work.
            Event Types:
              name: Event Types
              description_student: Review the basics of programming in App Lab and explore some new event types that can be used in your programs.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students review the material they learned about creating apps in App Lab from Unit 4 in order to prepare for a return to App Lab in this unit. This review should be modified to best meet the needs of your students and their experience and familiarity with programming in App Lab. In addition to the review the students will also experiment with a variety of new event types that they likely have not seen before.
            Getters and Setters:
              name: Getters and Setters
              description_student: By reading and changing the content on the screen of an app, the class starts to build apps that only need a single screen. Even with just one screen, these techniques allow for lots of user interaction and functionality.
              description_teacher: In Unit 4 students learned a very simple approach to app development in App Lab that required a separate screen for most interactions. To expand the kinds of apps that students can make, and to encourage them to think in new ways about how users interact with apps, we introduce the concept of "getters" and "setters". These are commands which can get and set (or change) the content and properties of various design elements. In this lesson students build up simple apps that only require a single screen, the content of which is changed using getters and setters.
            The Circuit Playground:
              name: Sirkuit Bermain Anak
              description_student: Get to know the Circuit Playground, the circuit board that will be used throughout the rest of this unit. Using App Lab, develop programs that use the Circuit Playground for output.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students get their first opportunity to write programs that use the Circuit Playground. After first inspecting the board visually and hypothesizing possibly functionalities, students move online where they will learn to write applications that control an LED. By combining App Lab screens with the Circuit Playgrounds, students can gradually start to integrate elements of the board as an ouput device while relying on App Lab for user input.
            Lists:
              name: List
              description_student: Learn how lists can be used to store multiple values in a single variable name.
              description_teacher: A list, also commonly known as an array, is a type of variable that can store many values at once. In this lesson, students learn to create lists which store a series of related values in a single variable. After creating lists of their own, students will learn about ways to extract either a specific or random value from a list using its index.
            Lights:
              name: Lights
              description_student: Using the concept of lists from the previous lesson, the class writes programs that control the ten color LEDs on the Circuit Playground.
              description_teacher: The Circuit Playground includes 10 color LEDs in a ring around the outside edge. These LEDs are accessible in code as a list called `colorLeds`. Building on the understanding of lists from the previous lesson, students write programs that control the color LEDs by accessing them from a list.
            For Loops:
              name: Untuk Pengulangan
              description_student: The class learns about repeating instructions using a _for loop_, first by controlling a "robot" through a grid, and then in App Lab.
              description_teacher: Students are introduced to the _for loop_ in this lesson as a way to repeat some code a certain numbers of times. Students start with an unplugged activity where they use for loops to navigate a robot across a grid. Once complete, students then take their knowledge into App Lab where they write programs that rely on iteration using a _for loop_.
            Lists and For Loops:
              name: Lists and For Loops
              description_student: Combining _lists_ and _for loops_ allows you to write code that impacts every element of a list, regardless of how long it is. The class uses this structure to write programs that process all of the elements in lists, include the list of color LEDs.
              description_teacher: 'Using a _for loop_ to iterate over all of the elements in an array is a really useful construct in most programming languages. In this lesson, students combine what they have learned about lists and for loops in order to start learning this pattern. Students use for loops to go through each element in a list one at a time without having to write code for each element. Towards the end of the lesson students will apply this with the `colorLed` list on the board. '
            Timed Loops:
              name: Timed Loops
              description_student: In this lesson we build on students understanding of for loops to learn about a more sophisticated structure called a timed loop. Unlike for loops, you can control how quickly a timed loop repeats, and other code (such as event handlers) can be run between iterations of the loop. This allows us to create interesting animations that repeat infinitely, while still allowing other code to run alongside it.

            'Project: Board Output':
              name: 'Project: Board Output'
              description_student: Students take what they've learned through chapter one, and develop an app of their own design that uses the board to output information.
              description_teacher: Students take what they've learned through chapter one, and develop an app of their own design that uses the board to output information.
            Physical Input:
              name: Physical Input
              description_student: Using the hardware buttons and switch, the class develops programs that use the Circuit Playground as an input.
              description_teacher: This lesson transitions students from consider the Circuit Playground as strictly an output device towards using it as a tool for both input and output. Starting with the hardware buttons and switch,sing the hardware buttons and switch, students learn to use `onBoardEvent()`, analogously to `onEvent()`, in order to take input from their Circuit Playgrounds.
            Analog Input:
              name: Analog Input
              description_student: Explore the analog inputs on the Circuit Playground, writing programs that respond to the environment through sensors.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students explore how the three analog sensors (sound, light, and temperature) can be used to write programs that respond to changes in the environment. The use of these sensors marks a transition in terms of how users interact with a program. By using sensors as an input, the user of an app doesn't have to directly interact with it at all, or may interact without actually realizing they are doing so.
            Sensor Applications:
              name: Sensor Applications
              description_student: Work through three small apps to better understand the uses of the sensors from the previous lesson.
              description_teacher: To follow up on the sensors that students learned about in the previous lesson, we walk through a three apps, each of which relies on a different sensor. These three apps can serve as jumping off points for students in the final project that follows.
            'Project: Prototype an Innovation':
              name: 'Project: Prototype an Innovation'
              description_student: Develop innovative computing devices of your own design, using everything you've learned throughout this course.
              description_teacher: 'In this final project for the course, students team to develop and test a prototype for an innovative computing device based on the Circuit Playground. Using the inputs and outputs available on the board, groups will create programs that allow for interesting and unique user interactions. '
            Designing Screens with Code:
              name: Perancangan Layar dengan Kode
              description_student: By reading and changing the content on the screen of an app, the class starts to build apps that only need a single screen. Even with just one screen, these techniques allow for lots of user interaction and functionality.
              description_teacher: In Unit 4 students learned a very simple approach to app development in App Lab that required a separate screen for most interactions. To expand the kinds of apps that students can make, and to encourage them to think in new ways about how users interact with apps, we introduce the `setProperty()` block. This command can be used to set the content and properties of various UI elements, allowing students to write programs that update information on a single screen, instead of manually creating duplicate screens. In this lesson students build up simple apps that only require a single screen, the content of which is changed using `setProperty()`.
            Board Events:
              name: Board Events
              description_student: Using the hardware buttons and switch, the class develops programs that use the Circuit Playground as an input.
              description_teacher: This lesson transitions students from consider the Circuit Playground as strictly an output device towards using it as a tool for both input and output. Starting with the hardware buttons and switch,sing the hardware buttons and switch, students learn to use `onBoardEvent()`, analogously to `onEvent()`, in order to take input from their Circuit Playgrounds.
            Getting Properties:
              name: Getting Properties
              description_student: This lesson introduces students to the getProperty block, which allows them to access the properties of different elements with code.  Students first practice using the block to determine what the user has input in various user interface elements. Students later use getProperty and setProperty together with the counter patters to make elements move across the screen.  A new screen element, the slider, and a new event trigger, onChange, are also introduced.

            The Program Design Process:
              name: Proses Desain Program
              description_student: This lesson introduces students to the process they will use to design programs of their own throughout this unit. This process is centered around a project guide which asks students to sketch out their screens, identify elements of the Circuit Playground to be used, define variables, and describe events before they begin programming. This process is similar to the Game Design Process that we used in Unit 3. In this lesson students begin by playing a tug o' war style game where the code is hidden. They discuss what they think the board components, events, and variables would need to be to make the program. They are then given a completed project guide which shows one way to implement the project. Students are then walked through this process through a series of levels. At the end of the lesson students have an opportunity to make improvements to the program to make it their own.

            Arrays:
              name: Arrays
              description_student: Learn how lists can be used to store multiple values in a single variable name.
              description_teacher: An array is an ordered collection of items, usually of the same type. In this lesson, students learn ways to access either a specific or random value from a list using its index.  They then learn how to access the colorLEDs array that controls the behavior of the color LEDs on the Circuit Playground.  Students will control the color and intensity of each LED, then use what they have learned to program light patterns to create a light show on their Circuit Playground.
            Making Music:
              name: Membuat musik
              description_student: In this lesson students will use the buzzer to its full extent by producing sounds, notes, and songs with the buzzer. Students start with a short review of the buzzer's frequency and duration parameters, then move on to the concept of notes.  Notes allow students to constrain themselves to frequencies that are used in Western music and provide a layer of abstraction that helps them to understand which frequencies might sound good together.  Onces students are able to play notes on the buzzer, they use arrays to hold and play sequences of notes, forming simple songs.

Students use for loops to go through each element in a list one at a time without having to write code for each element. Towards the end of the lesson students will apply this with the `colorLed` list on the board to create an app that changes all of the LEDs each time a button is clicked.
            Accelerometer:
              name: Accelerometer
              description_student: In this lesson, students will explore the accelerometer and its capabilities. They’ll become familiar with its events and properties, as well as create multiple programs utilizing the accelerometer similar to those they’ve likely come across in real world applications.

            Functions with Parameters:
              name: Fungsi dengan parameter
              description_student: The lesson starts with a quick review of parameters, in the context of App Lab blocks that they students have seen recently.  Students then look at examples of parameters within user-created functions in App Lab and create and call functions with parameters for themselves, using them to control multiple elements on a screen.  Afterwards, students use for loops to iterate over an array, passing each element into a function.  Last, students use what they have learned to create a star catching game.

          description_audience: ''
          description_short: Learn how people use computers to solve data problems.
          description: Unit 5 is about the importance of data in solving problems and highlights how computers can help in this process. The first chapter explores different systems used to represent information in a computer and the challenges and tradeoffs posed by using them. In the second chapter you’ll learn how collections of data are used to solve problems, and how computers help to automate the steps of this process. The chapter concludes by considering how the data problem solving process can be applied to an area of your choosing.
          stages:
            Representation Matters:
              name: Representation Matters
              description_student: This first lesson provides an overview of what data is and how it is used to solve problems.  Groups use a data set to make a series of meal recommendations for people with various criteria.   Afterwards, groups compare their responses and discuss how the different representations of the meal data affected how the students were able to solve the different problems.
              description_teacher: In the first lesson of the data unit, students get an overview of what data is and how it is used to solve problems.  Students start off with a brief discussion to come to a common understanding of data.  They then split into groups and use a data set to make a series of meal recommendations for people with various criteria.  Each group has the choices of meal represented in a different way (pictures, recipes, menu, nutrition) that gives an advantage for one of the recommendations.  Afterwards, groups compare their responses and discuss how the different representations of the meal data affected how the students were able to solve the different problems.
            Patterns and Representation:
              name: Patterns and Representation
              description_student: This lesson looks closer at what is needed to create a system of representation.  Groups create systems that can represent any letter in the alphabet using only a single stack of cards, then create messages with their systems and exchange with other groups to ensure the system worked as intended.   The class discusses commonalities between working systems while recognizing that there are many possible working solutions.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students create their own system for representing information. They begin by brainstorming all the different systems they already use to represent yes-no responses. They then work in small groups to create a system that can represent any letter in the alphabet using only a single stack of cards. The cards used have one of 6 different possible drawings (6 animals, 6 colors, etc.) and so to represent the entire alphabet students will need to use patterns of multiple cards to represent each letter. Students create messages with their systems and exchange with other groups to ensure the system worked as intended. In the wrap-up discussion the class  reviews any pros and cons of the different systems. They discuss commonalities between working systems and recognize that there are many possible solutions to this problem and what's important is that everyone use the same arbitrary system to communicate.
            ASCII and Binary Representation:
              name: ASCII and Binary Representation
              description_student: This lesson introduces a formal binary system for encoding information, the ASCII system for representing letters and other characters. At the beginning of the lesson the teacher introduces the fact that computers must represent information using either "on" or "off". The class is then introduced to the ASCII system for representing text using binary symbols and practices using this system before encoding their own messages using ASCII.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students learn to use their first binary system for encoding information, the ASCII system for representing letters and other characters. At the beginning of the lesson the teacher introduces the fact that computers must represent information using either "on" or "off". Then students are introduced to the ASCII system for representing text using binary symbols. Students practice using this system before encoding their own message using ASCII. At the end of the lesson a debrief conversation helps synthesize the key learning objectives of the activity.
            Representing Images:
              name: Representing Images
              description_student: This lesson continues the study of binary representation systems, this time with images. The class is introduced to the concept of splitting images into squares or "pixels" which can then be turned on or off individually to make the entire image. After doing a short set of challenges using the Pixelation Widget, the class makes connections between the system for representing images and the system for representing text they learned in the previous lesson.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students learn how computers represent images. To begin the lesson they consider the challenge of turning all the complexity of vision into a binary pattern. Through a series of images showing how this transformation is made students are introduced to the concept of splitting images into squares or "pixels" which can then be turned on or off individually to make the entire image. Students then do a short set of challenges using the Pixelation Widget in order to draw black and white images. Puzzles are designed to call out some of the challenges of representing images in this way. In the wrap up students make connections between the system for representing images and the system for representing text they learned in the previous lesson.

              name: Mewakili Angka Bagian 2
            Combining Representations:
              name: Combining Representations
              description_student: This lesson combines all three types of binary representation systems (ASCII characters, binary number, and images) to allow for the encode of more complex types information in a record.  After seeing a series of bits and being asked to decode them, the class is introduced to the idea that  understanding binary information requires understanding both the system that is being used and the meaning of the information encoded.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students use all three types of binary representation systems (ASCII characters, binary number, and images) to decode information in a record.  After seeing a series of bits and being asked to decode them, students are introduced to the idea that in order to understand binary information, they must understand both the system that is being used and the meaning of the information encoded.  They then decode a record representing a pet based on a given structure.
            Project - Create a Representation:
              name: Project - Create a Representation
              description_student: The class designs structure to represent their perfect day using the binary representation systems they've learned in this chapter. After deciding which pieces of information the record should capture, the class will decide how a punch card of bytes of information will be interpreted to represent those pieces of information. Afterwards, everyone will use the ASCII, binary number, and image formats they have learned to represent their perfect days try to decipher what a partner's perfect day is like.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students design a structure to represent their perfect day using the binary representation systems they've learned in this chapter. Students will first write a short description of their perfect day and then review with a partner to identify the key pieces of information they think a computer could capture. As a class students will decide how a punch card of bytes of information will be interpreted to represent those pieces of information. Students will then use the ASCII, binary number, and image formats they have learned to represent their perfect days. Students then trade punch cards and try to decipher what the other student's perfect day is like. The lesson ends with a reflection.
            Problem Solving and Data:
              name: Pemecahan masalah dan Data
              description_student: This lesson covers how the problem solving process can be tailored to deal with data problems, in particular.  The class is tasked with deciding what a city most needs to spend resources on.  They must find and use data from the Internet to support their decision.
              description_teacher: 'In this lesson, students use the problem solving process from earlier in the course to solve a data problem.  After reviewing the process, the class is presented with a decision: whether a city should build a library, pet shelter, or fire department.  Students work in teams to collect information on the Internet to help them decide what should be built, then use this information build an argument that will convince the city council of their choice.  They then map what they have done to the problem solving process that they have been using throughout the course, comparing the general problem solving process to its specific application to data problems.'
            Making Decisions with Data:
              name: Making Decisions with Data
              description_student: This lesson gives the class a chance to practice the data problem solving process introduced in the last lesson.  Not all questions have right answers and in some cases the class can and should decide that they should collect more data. The lesson concludes with a discussion of how different people could draw different conclusions from the same data, or how collecting different data might have affected the decisions they made.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students get practice making decisions with data based on some problems designed to be familiar to middle school students. Students work in groups discussing how they would use the data presented to make a decision before the class discusses their final choices. Not all questions have right answers and in some cases students can and should decide that they should collect more data. The lesson concludes with a discussion of how different people could draw different conclusions from the same data, or how collecting different data might have affected the decisions they made.
            Interpreting Data:
              name: Interpreting Data
              description_student: Students begin the lesson by looking at a cake preference survey that allows respondents to specify both a cake and an icing flavor.  They discuss how knowing the relationship between cake and icing preference helps them better decide which combination to recommend.  They are then introduced to cross tabulation, which allows them to graph relationships to different preferences.  They use this technique to find relationships in a preference survey, then brainstorm the different types of problems that this process could help solve.

            Automating Data Decisions:
              name: Mengotomatisasi Data Keputusan
              description_student: In this lesson students look at a simple example of how a computer could be used to complete the decision making step of the data problem solving process. Students are given the task of creating an algorithm that could suggest a vacation spot.  Students then create rules, or an algorithm, that a computer could use to make this decision automatically. Students share their rules and what choices their rules would make with the class data. They then use their rules on data from their classmates to test whether their rules would make the same decision that  a person would. The lesson concludes with a discussion about the benefits and drawbacks of using computers to automate the data problem solving process.

            Problem Solving with Big Data:
              name: Pemecahan masalah dengan Data Besar
              description_student: This lesson covers how data is collected and used by a organizations to solve problems in the real world. The class looks at three scenarios that could be solved using data and brainstorms the types of data they would want to solve them and how they could collect the data.  Each scenario also includes a video about a real-world service that has solved a similar problem with data.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students look at how data is collected and used by organizations to solve problems in the real world. The lesson begins with a quick review of the data problem solving process they  explored in the last lesson. Then students are presented three scenarios that could be solved using data and brainstorm the types of data they would want to solve them and how they could collect the data. Each problem is designed to reflect a real-world service that exists. After brainstorming, students watch a video about a real-world service and record notes about what data is collected by the real-world service and how it is used. At the end of the lesson, students record whether data was provided actively by a user, was recorded passively, or is collected by sensors.
            Project - Solve a Data Problem:
              name: Project - Solve a Data Problem
              description_student: To conclude this unit the class designs ways to use data to make a recommendations or predictions to help solve a problem.  In the first several steps the class brainstorms problems, performs simple research, and defines a problem of their choosing. They then decide what kind of data they want to collect, how it could be collected, and how it could be used, before exchanging feedback and giving a final presentation.
              description_teacher: To conclude this unit, students design a recommendation engine based on data that they collect and analyze from their classmates. After looking at an example of a recommendation app, students follow a project guide to complete this multi-day activity. In the first several steps, students choose what choice they want to help the user to make, what data they need to give the recommendation, create a survey, and collect information about their classmates' choices. They then interpret the data and use what they have learned to create the recommendation algorithm.  Last, they use their algorithms to make recommendations to a few classmates. Students perform a peer review and make any necessary updates to their projects before preparing a presentation to the class.
            Representing Numbers:
              name: Representing Numbers
              description_student: This lesson introduces the binary number system.  With a set of cards that represent the place values in a binary (base-2) number system, the class turns bits "on" or "off" by turning cards face up and face down, then observes the numbers that result from these different patterns.  Eventually, the pattern is extended to a generic 4-bit system.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students learn about the binary number system.  With a set of cards that represent the place values in a binary (base-2) number system by a collection of dots, students turn bits "on" or "off" by turning cards face up and face down, then observe the numbers that result from these different patterns.  Eventually, students extend the pattern to a generic 4-bit system.
            8-bit Numbers:
              name: 8-bit Numbers
              description_student: Students review the concept of binary numbers, and discuss that they need to know the bit-length of each number in order to decode a series of bits.  They then made a flippy-do, a paper manipulative that will help them to encode and decode 8-bit numbers (0-255).  After practicing with the flippy-do, students discuss how they could extend that standardization to the other types of data.

            Encryption:
              name: Encryption
              description_student: Students have a discussion on the different levels of security they would like for personal data.  Once the class has developed an understanding of the importance of privacy, they learn about the process of encrypting information by enciphering a note for a partner and deciphering the partner's note.  The class concludes with a discussion about the importance of both physical and digital security.

            Structuring Data:
              name: Penataan Data
              description_student: This lesson goes further into the interpretation of data, including cleaning and visualizing raw data sets.  The class first looks at the how presenting data in different ways can help people to understand it better.  After seeing how cleaning and visualization can help people make better decisions, the class looks at what parts of this process can be automated, and what need a human.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students go further into the collection and interpretation of data, including cleaning and visualizing data.  Students first look at the how presenting data in different ways can help people to understand it better, and they then create visualizations of their own data. Using a the results of a preferred pizza topping survey, students must decide what to do with data that does not easily fit into the visualization scheme that they have chosen.  Finally, students look at which parts of this process can be automated by a computer and which need a human to make decisions.

              description_student: This lesson will give you practice in the skills you will need for this course.
              description_teacher: 'In this set of puzzles, students will begin with an introduction (or review depending on the experience of your class) of Code.org''s online workspace. There will be videos pointing out the basic functionality of the workspace including the `Run`, `Reset`, and `Step` buttons. Also discussed in these videos: dragging Blockly blocks, deleting Blockly blocks, and connecting Blockly blocks. Next, students will practice their _sequencing_ and _debugging_ skills in maze. From there, students will see new types of puzzles like Collector, Artist, and Harvester when they learn the very basics of _loops_.'
            'Algorithms: Graph Paper Programming':
              name: 'Pemrograman: Kertas Grafik Pemrograman'
              description_student: In this lesson, you will program your friend to draw pictures!
              description_teacher: By "programming" one another to draw pictures, students will begin to understand what coding is really about. The class will begin by having students instruct each other to color squares on graph paper in an effort to reproduce an existing picture. If there’s time, the lesson can conclude with images that the students create themselves.
            Events in Bounce:
              name: Events in Bounce
              description_student: Ever wish you could play video games in school? In this lesson, you will get to make your own!
              description_teacher: In this online activity, students will learn what events are, and how computers use them in programs like video games. Students will work through puzzles making the program react to events (like arrow buttons being pressed.) At the end of the puzzle, students will have the opportunity to customize their game with different speeds and sounds.
            Nested Loops:
              name: Perulangan bertingkat
              description_student: Loops inside loops inside loops. What does this mean? This lesson will teach you what happens when you place a loop inside another loop.
              description_teacher: In this online activity, students will have the opportunity to push their understanding of loops to a whole new level. Playing with the Bee and Plants vs Zombies, students will learn how to program a loop to be inside of another loop. They will also be encouraged to figure out how little changes in either loop will affect their program when they click `Run`.
            Nested Loops in Artist:
              name: Nested Loops in Artist
              description_student: Here you will be using nested loops to make cool drawings to show to your family and friends.
              description_teacher: Now that students know how to layer their loops, they can create so many beautiful things.  This lesson will take students through a series of exercises to help them create their own portfolio-ready images.
            'Algorithms: Relay Programming':
              name: 'Debugging: Relay Programming'
              description_student: Remember at the beginning of the course when you made drawings with code? In this lesson, you will be working with a team to do something very similar!
              description_teacher: This activity will begin with a short review of "Graph Paper Programming," then will quickly move to a race against the clock, as students break into teams and work together to write a program one instruction at a time.
            Debugging in Bee:
              name: Debugging in Bee
            While Loops in Farmer:
              name: While Loops in Farmer
              description_student: 'Loops are so useful in coding. This lesson will teach you about a new kind of loop: while loops!'
              description_teacher: "By the time students reach this lesson, they should already have plenty of practice using `repeat` loops, so now it's time to mix things up. \n\n_While loops_ are loops that continue to repeat commands while a condition is met. While loops are used when the programmer doesn't know the exact number of times commands need to be repeated, but does know what condition needs to be true in order for the loop to continue repeating. For example, students will be working to fill holes and dig dirt in Farmer. They will not know the size of the holes or the height of the mountains of dirt, but the students will know they need to keep filling the holes and digging the dirt as long as the ground is not flat."
            Conditionals with Cards:
              name: 'If/Else: Conditionals with Cards'
              description_student: It's time to play a game where you earn points only under certain conditions!
              description_teacher: "Pelajaran ini menunjukkan bagaimana conditional dapat digunakan untuk menyesuaikan program untuk informasi spesifik. Kita tidak selalu memiliki semua informasi yang kita butuhkan ketika menulis program. Kadang-kadang anda akan ingin melakukan sesuatu yang berbeda dalam situasi yang satu dari pada yang lain, bahkan jika anda tidak tahu situasi apa yang akan terjadi ketika kode anda berjalan. Itu adalah di mana conditional datang. Conditional memungkinkan komputer untuk membuat keputusan berdasarkan informasi yang benar setiap saat kode dijalankan."
            Conditionals in Bee:
              name: Conditionals in Bee
              description_student: 'Now that you understand conditionals, it''s time to program Bee to use them when collecting honey and nectar. '
              description_teacher: Up until this point students have been writing code that executes exactly the same way each time it is run - reliable, but not very flexible. In this lesson, your class will begin to code with conditionals, allowing them to write code that functions differently depending on the specific conditions the program encounters.
            Conditionals & Loops in Maze:
              name: Conditionals & Loops in Maze
              description_student: You can do some amazing things when you use conditionals and loops together!
              description_teacher: 'In this lesson, students will be pairing together two key concepts: loops and conditionals. This set of puzzles bridges the gaps in understanding that occur when working on puzzles that use multiple kinds of blocks. By bringing two ideas together, students will create more complex code that shows both impressive creativity and critical thinking!'
            Conditionals & Loops in Farmer:
              name: Conditionals & Loops in Harvester
              description_student: It's not always clear when to use each conditional.  This lesson will help you get practice deciding what to do.
              description_teacher: Students will practice `while` loops, `until` loops, and `if / else` statements. All of these blocks use conditionals. By practicing all three, students will learn to write complex and flexible code.
            Digital Citizenship:
              name: 'Digital Kewarganegaraan: Berlatih Digital Kewarganegaraan'
              description_student: Some information is not safe to share online. This lesson will help you learn the difference between safe and private information.
              description_teacher: |-
                In collaboration with Common Sense Education, this lesson helps students learn to think critically about the user information that some websites request or require. Students learn the difference between private information and personal information, distinguishing what is safe and unsafe to share online.
                
                Students will also explore what it means to be responsible and respectful to their offline and online communities as a step toward learning how to be good digital citizens.

              name: 'Dicabut: Biner'
              description_student: 'Learn how computers store pictures using simple ideas like on and off. '
              description_teacher: Though many people think of binary as strictly zeros and ones, students will be introduced to the idea that information can be represented in a variety of binary options. This lesson takes that concept one step further as it illustrates how a computer can store even more complex information (such as images and colors) in binary, as well.
            Artist Binary:
              name: Artis Biner
              description_student: Direct your own artist to create a binary image using only commands to turn pixels on and off.
              description_teacher: Binary is extremely important in the world of computers. The majority of computers today store all sorts of information in binary form. This lesson helps demonstrate how it is possible to take something from real life and translate it into a series of ons and offs. Students will build binary images in Artist by translating 0s and 1s to offs and ons (or blacks and whites).
            Nested Loops Project in Artist:
              name: Nested Loops in Frozen
              description_student: More nested loops! This time, you get to make some AMAZING drawing with nested loops.
              description_teacher: Students will create intricate designs using Artist in today's set of puzzles. By continuing to practice nested loops with new goals, students will see more uses of loops in general. This set of puzzles also offers a lot more potential for creativity with an opportunity for students to create their own design at the end of the stage.
            Debugging in Collector:
              name: Debugging in Collector
              description_student: Have you ever run into problems while coding? In this lesson, you will learn about the secrets of debugging. Debugging is the process of finding and fixing problems in your code.

              name: 'Algorithms: Tangrams'
              description_student: Here you will learn about algorithms using puzzles called tangrams!
              description_teacher: This lesson shows us something important about algorithms. As long as you keep an algorithm simple, there are lots of ways to use it. However, if you want to make sure everyone produces the same outcome, then your algorithm needs more detail. Students will learn the difference between a detailed and general algorithm while playing with tangrams.
            Introduction:
              name: Pengantar teka-Teki secara Online
              description_student: This lesson will give you a brief introduction to some of the amazing things you will learn in this course!
              description_teacher: 'In this lesson, students will be introduced to sequences, loops, and nested loops to prepare them for more complicated concepts in the later part of the course. This "ramp up" lesson equalizes the playing field between the experts and the beginners in your class. '
            The Power of Words:
              name: 'Digital Kewarganegaraan: Kekuatan kata-Kata'
              description_student: Bullying tidak pernah baik-baik saja. Pelajaran ini akan mengajarkan anda tentang apa yang bisa dan tidak apa-apa untuk mengatakan secara online.
              description_teacher: "Students consider that while they are enjoying their favorite websites they may encounter messages from other kids that can make them feel angry, hurt, sad, or fearful. They explore ways to handle cyberbullying and how to respond in the face of upsetting language online.\n\nStudents discuss all the ways they use technology for communication and explore the similarities and differences between in-person and online communication. Students then brainstorm ways to respond to cyberbullying. "

              description_teacher: Variables are used as placeholders for values such as numbers or words. Variables allow for a lot of freedom in programming. Instead of having to type out a phrase many times or remember an obscure number, computer scientists can use variables to reference them. This lesson helps to explain what variables are and how we can use them in many different ways. The idea of variables isn't an easy concept to grasp, so we recommend allowing plenty of time for discussion at the end of the lesson.
            Variables in Artist:
              name: Variables in Artist
              description_student: Don't forget to bring creativity to class! In these puzzles you will be making fantastic drawings using variables.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students will explore the creation of repetitive designs using variables in the Artist environment.

              name: 'For Loops: For Loop Fun'
              description_student: You're going to have loads of fun learning about `for` loops!
              description_teacher: 'We know that loops allow us to do things over and over again, but now we’re going to learn how to use loops that have extra structures built right in. These new structures will allow students to create code that is more powerful and dynamic. '
            For Loops in Bee:
              name: For Loops in Bee
              description_student: Buzz buzz. In these puzzles you will be guiding a bee to nectar and honey using `for` loops!
              description_teacher: Featuring Bee, this lesson focuses on for loops and using an incrementing variable to solve more complicated puzzles. Students will begin by reviewing loops from previous lessons, then walked through using for loops to more effectively solve complicated problems.
            For Loops in Artist:
              name: For Loops in Artist
              description_student: Get ready to make your next masterpiece. Here you will be using `for` loops to make some jaw-dropping pictures.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students continue to practice for loops, this time with Artist. Students will complete puzzles combining the ideas of variables, loops, and for loops to create complex designs. At the end, they will have a chance to create their own art in a freeplay level.
            Songwriting with Parameters:
              name: 'Functions: Songwriting with Parameters'
              description_student: You just might release the next big hit single! In this lesson, you will be learning what parameters are and how they make some fantastic songs!
              description_teacher: One of the most magnificent structures in the computer science world is the function. Functions (sometimes called procedures) are mini programs that you can use over and over inside of your bigger program. This lesson will help students intuitively understand why combining chunks of code into functions is such a helpful practice, and how they can use those structures even when chunks of code are slightly different.
            Conditionals and Functions in Bee:
              name: Conditionals and Functions in Bee
              description_student: The bee needs your help again! Here you will be using functions to get nectar and make honey!

            Functions with Parameters in Bee:
              name: Functions with Parameters in Bee
              description_student: You've had a little practice using functions with parameters. This lesson will continue your practice with Bee!
              description_teacher: This lesson features the bee environment, and continues along the concept of functions with parameters from the previous Artist stage. Students will practice writing and using functions to follow complex paths and collect patterns of nectar and honey.
            Explore Project Ideas:
              name: Explore Project Ideas
              description_student: Time to get some inspiration! These puzzles will show you a handful of pre-built games and illustrations to help develop your plan for your BIG project.
              description_teacher: "The next five lessons provide an opportunity for students to put their coding skills to use in a capstone project. This project will help individuals gain experience with coding and produce an exemplar to share with peers and loved ones. This is intended to be a multi-lesson or multi-week project where students spend time brainstorming, learning about the design process, building, and then presenting their final work. \n\nIn the explore stage, students will be able to view examples of projects in both Artist and Play Lab for inspiration. Next, students will learn about the design process and how to implement it in their own projects. They will then be given the space to create their own project in either Artist or Play Lab (this is most likely the longest stage of the project). Students will then revise their projects, after testing and extra thought. Finally, students will be able to present their finished work to their peers."

              description_student: Dalam rangka untuk membuat lebih menarik dan lengkap gambar, kelas diperkenalkan ke objek sprite. Setiap sprite dapat ditugaskan gambar untuk menunjukkan, dan sprite juga melacak beberapa nilai-nilai tentang diri mereka sendiri, yang akan berguna di jalan, ketika membuat animasi. Di akhir pelajaran, semua orang membuat adegan menggunakan sprite.
              description_teacher: In order to create more interesting and detailed images, students are introduced to the sprite object. Every sprite can be assigned an image to show, and sprites also keep track of multiple values about themselves, which will prove useful down the road when making animations.
            The Draw Loop:
              name: The Draw Loop
              description_student: This lesson introduces the draw loop, one of the core programming paradigms in Game Lab.  The class combines the draw loop with random numbers to manipulate some simple animations with dots and then with sprites. Afterwards, everyone uses what they learned to update the sprite scene from the previous lesson.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students are introduced to the draw loop, one of the core programming paradigms in Game Lab. To begin the lesson students look at some physical flipbooks to see that having many frames with different images creates the impression of motion. Students then watch a video explaining how the draw loop in Game Lab helps to create this same impression in their programs. Students combine the draw loop with random numbers to manipulate some simple animations with dots and then with sprites. At the end of the lesson students use what they learned to update their sprite scene from the previous lesson.

            Booleans Unplugged:
              name: Booleans dicabut
              description_student: Pelajaran ini memperkenalkan nilai-nilai boolean dan logika, serta pernyataan bersyarat. Kelas dimulai dengan bermain game sederhana dari Berdiri, Duduk di mana boolean (benar/palsu) pernyataan yang menggambarkan sifat-sifat pribadi (rambut atau warna mata, jenis pakaian, usia, dll). Kelas, kemudian kelompok benda berdasarkan semakin kompleks pernyataan boolean, kemudian melihat bagaimana dapat bersyarat mempengaruhi aliran program.
              description_teacher: |-
                In this lesson, students are introduced to boolean values and logic, as well as conditional statements. The class starts by playing a simple game of Stand Up, Sit Down in which the boolean (true/false) statements describe personal properties (hair or eye color, clothing type, age, etc). This gets students thinking about how they can frame a property with multiple potential values (such as age) with a binary question.
                
                From there students are provided a group of objects with similar, yet varying, physical properties. With a partner they group those objects based on increasingly complex boolean statements, including compound booleans with AND and OR.
                
                Finally we reveal Conditionals as a tool to make decisions or impact the flow of a program using boolean statements as input.
            Conditionals:
              name: Kondisi
              description_student: The class starts by using booleans to compare the current value of a sprite property with a target value, using that comparison to determine when a sprite has reached a point on the screen, grown to a given size, or otherwise reached a value using the counter pattern. After using booleans directly to investigate the values or sprite properties, the class adds conditional if statements to write code that responds to those boolean comparisons.

After using booleans directly to investigate the values or sprite properties, students add conditional _if_ statements to write code that responds to those boolean comparisons.
            Keyboard Input:
              name: Keyboard Input
              description_student: Following the introduction to booleans and if statements in the previous lesson, students are introduced to a new block called keyDown() which returns a boolean and can be used in conditionals statements to move sprites around the screen. By the end of this lesson students will have written programs that take keyboard input from the user to control sprites on the screen.
              description_teacher: Following the introduction to booleans and _if_ statements in the previous lesson, students are introduced to a new block called `keyDown()` which returns a boolean and can be used in conditionals statements to move sprites around the screen. By the end of this lesson students will have written programs that take keyboard input from the user to control sprites on the screen.
            Other Forms of Input:
              name: Other Forms of Input
              description_student: The class continues to explore ways to use conditional statements to take user input. In addition to the simple keyDown() command learned yesterday, the class learns about several other keyboard input commands as well as ways to take mouse input.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students continue to explore ways to use conditional statements to take user input. In addition to the simple `keyDown()` command learned yesterday, students will learn about several other keyboard input commands as well as ways to take mouse input.

            Velocity:
              name: Percepatan
              description_student: Setelah pengarahan singkat tentang bagaimana menggunakan pola Pencacah untuk memindahkan spirit, kelas diperkenalkan pada properti yang mengatur kecepatan dan kecepatan rotasi secara langsung. mereka menggunakan properti baru ini dengan cara mereka sendiri, mereka membangun keterampilan yang mereka butuhkan untuk membuat sisi dasar permainan scroller.
              description_teacher: Setelah melihat singkat tentang bagaimana mereka melawan menggunakan pola untuk memindahkan sprite dalam pelajaran sebelumnya, siswa diperkenalkan dengan sifat yang membedakan kecepatan dan kecepatan rotasi ini diatas. Karena mereka menggunakan sifat-sifat baru dengan cara yang berbeda, mereka membangun keterampilan yang mereka butuhkan untuk membuat dasar sisi permainan scroller.
            Collision Detection:
              name: Deteksi tumbukan
              description_student: Kelas belajar tentang deteksi tabrakan di komputer. Pasang bagaimana bisa mengeksplorasi komputer menggunakan lokasi sprite dan ukuran sifat dan matematika untuk mendeteksi apakah dua sprite yang menyentuh. Kelas kemudian menyentuh menggunakan blok() untuk menciptakan efek yang berbeda ketika sprite bertabrakan, termasuk bermain suara. Terakhir, mereka menggunakan keterampilan baru untuk meningkatkan sisi scroller permainan yang mereka mulai di pelajaran yang lalu.
              description_teacher: Students learn about collision detection on the computer.  Working in pairs, they explore how a computer could use sprite location and size properties and math to detect whether two sprites are touching.  They then use the `isTouching()` block to create different effects when sprites collide, including playing sounds.  Last, they use their new skills to improve the sidescroller game that they started in the last lesson.
            Complex Sprite Movement:
              name: Complex Sprite Movement
              description_student: 'Kelas belajar untuk menggabungkan kecepatan sifat sprite dengan melawan pola untuk membuat gerakan sprite yang lebih kompleks, seperti simulasi gravitasi, membuat sprite melompat, dan memungkinkan mengabung sprite kiri atau kanan. Di tingkat akhir kelas menggabungkan gerakan-gerakan ini untuk menghidupkan dan mengontrol satu sprite dan membangun sebuah permainan sederhana di mana karakter terbang di sekitar dan mengumpulkan koin. '
              description_teacher: Students learn to combine the velocity properties of sprites with the counter pattern to create more complex sprite movement. In particular students will learn how to simulate gravity, make a sprite jump, and allow a sprite to float left or right. In the final levels of the Code Studio progression students combine these movements to animate and control a single sprite and build a simple game in which a character flies around and collects a coin. Students are encouraged to make their own additions to the game in the final level.
            Collisions:
              name: Tumbukan
              description_student: The class programs their sprites to interact in new ways.  After a brief review of how they used the isTouching block, the class brainstorms other ways that two sprites could interact.  They then use isTouching to make one sprite push another across the screen before practicing with the four collision blocks (collide, displace, bounce, and bounceOff).
              description_teacher: Students program their sprites to interact in new ways.  After a brief review of how they used the `isTouching` block, students brainstorm other ways that two sprites could interact.  They then use `isTouching` to make one sprite push another across the screen before practicing with the four collision blocks (`collide`, `displace`, `bounce`, and `bounceOff`).
            Functions:
              name: Fungsi
              description_student: This lesson covers functions as a way to organize their code, make it more readable, and remove repeated blocks of code. The class learns that higher level or more abstract steps make it easier to understand and reason about steps, then begins to create functions in Game Lab.  At the end of the lesson the class uses these skills to organize and add functionality to the final version of their side scroller game.
              description_teacher: Students learn how to create functions to organize their code, make it more readable, and remove repeated blocks of code. An unplugged warmup explores how directions at different levels of detail can be useful depending on context. Students learn that higher level or more abstract steps make it easier to understand and reason about steps. Afterwards students learn to create functions in Game Lab. They will use functions to remove long blocks of code from their draw loop and to replace repeated pieces of code with a single function. At the end of the lesson students use these skills to organize and add functionality to the final version of their side scroller game.
            The Game Design Process:
              name: Proses perancangan permainan
              description_student: Pelajaran ini memperkenalkan proses kelas yang akan digunakan untuk sisa unit desain permainan. Kelas berjalan melalui melalui proses ini dalam serangkaian tingkat.

              description_teacher: Students will plan and build their own game using the project guide from the previous two lessons to guide their project. Working individually or in pairs, students will first decide on the type of game they'd like to build, taking as inspiration a set of sample games. They will then complete a blank project guide where they will describe the game's behavior and scope out the variables, sprites, and functions they'll need to build. In Code Studio, a series of levels prompts them on a general sequence they can use to implement this plan. Partway through the process, students will share their projects for peer review and will incorporate feedback as they finish their game. At the end of the lesson, students will share their completed games with their classmates. This project will span multiple classes and can easily take anywhere from 3-5 class periods.

              description_teacher: "As students have recently spent some time thinking about the actual content that will go into their personal website, this lesson takes a step back from the unit-long project (publication of a personal website) to help students articulate what personal information they choose to share digitally and with whom.  It also reinforces the notion that much of the information that they choose to share digitally falls largely out of their control the moment it is released.  \\r\n\\r\nStudents begin by individually identifying appropriate audiences with whom they would be comfortable sharing given pieces of personal information.  They then look at several social media pages to determine what sorts of information people are sharing about themselves or one another.  Last, students reflect on what guidelines they think are appropriate for posting information online.\\r\n\\r\nThe ultimate point of this lesson is not to scare students, but rather to experientially bring students to realizing precisely what level of control they don’t have in releasing information into the web."

          title: CSD Unit 6 - Physical Computing
          description: Unit 6 explores the role of hardware platforms in computing and how different sensors can provide more effective input and output than the traditional keyboard, mouse, and monitor. Using App Lab and Adafruit’s Circuit Playground, you’ll develop programs that utilize the same hardware inputs and outputs that you see in the smart devices, looking at how a simple rough prototype can lead to a finished product. The unit concludes with a design challenge to use the Circuit Playground as the basis for an innovation of your own design.

              description_teacher: In this progression, students will begin with an introduction (or review depending on the experience of your class) of Code.org's online workspace. Students will learn the basic functionality of the interface including the `Run`, `Reset`, and `Step` buttons. Dragging, deleting, and connecting Blockly blocks is also introduced in the beginning video. In the puzzles, students will practice their sequencing and debugging skills in Maze and Artist.
            Conditionals:
              name: Kondisi
              description_student: You will get to tell the computer what to do under certain conditions in this fun and challenging series.
              description_teacher: This lesson introduces students to `while` loops and `if / else` statements. _While loops_ are loops that continue to repeat commands as long as a condition is true. While loops are used when the programmer doesn't know the exact number of times the commands need to be repeated, but the programmer does know what condition needs to be true in order for the loop to continue looping. `If / Else` statements offer flexibility in programming by running entire sections of code only if something is true, otherwise it runs something else.
