## Why is the $10,000 hardware prize only available to public schools?

We would love to help teachers in public and private schools alike, but at this time, it comes down to logistics. We have partnered with [DonorsChoose.org](http://donorschoose.org) to administer classroom funding prizes, which only works with public, US K-12 schools. According to DonorsChoose.org, the organization is better able to access consistent and accurate data that's available for public schools.

Due to a small full-time staff, Code.org is unable to handle the logistics of administering international prizes. Because of this people outside the US are unable to qualify for prizes.
