# Termini di Servizio

Ultima revisione: 5 dicembre 2014

Code.org è un'organizzazione no-profit 501(c)(3) ("Code.org"). La nostra missione è dare a ogni studente l'opportunità di imparare l'informatica. Come parte di questa missione, Code.org gestisce i siti web <http://code.org>, <http://csedweek.org>, <http://computinginthecore.org>, <http://hourofcode.com>, altri siti Web, informazioni, testi, curriculum, video, grafica, foto, API, notifiche e-mail e altri materiali e prodotti correlati e servizi (i "**Servizi**"), tra cui la piattaforma di tutorial <http://studio.code.org> ("**Code Studio**").

Leggi attentamente questi Termini di Servizio ("**Termini**") prima di accedere o di utilizzare i Servizi. Accedendo o usando di qualsiasi parte dei Servizi o cliccando su un pulsante "Sono d'Accordo" o "Registrati" disponibile all'utente significa che l'utente accetta di essere vincolato da questi Termini senza alcuna modifica.

Questi termini sono un contratto legale tra te e Code.org riguardante il tuo uso dei servizi. Si possono utilizzare i servizi solo se viene stipulato un contratto vincolante con Code.org e se si è una persona ai cui è vietato ricevere servizi ai sensi delle leggi degli Stati Uniti o in un altra giurisdizione applicabile. Se si accettano queste condizioni e vengono utilizzati i servizi a nome di una compagnia, di un'organizzazione, di un governo, o di un'altra entità legale, si dichiara e garantisce di essere autorizzati a farlo. È possibile utilizzare i servizi solo in conformità con questi termini e tutte le leggi locali, statali, nazionali e internazionali applicabili, norme e regolamenti.

Queste condizioni sono soggette a modifiche. Se si continuano a utilizzare i servizi dopo che vengono modificati i termini si accetta di essere vincolati da tali modifiche, si prega quindi di controllare periodicamente le modifiche a queste condizioni.

## Condizioni Aggiuntive

Alcuni Servizi potrebbero essere soggetti a linee guida, regole, o termini di servizio aggiuntivi (“**Termini Aggiuntivi**”), e nel caso il tuo utilizzo di questi Servizi sarà condizionato dall'accettazione di questi Termini Aggiuntivi. Se dovesse esserci un qualche conflitto tra questi Termini e i Termini Aggiuntivi, i Termini Aggiuntivi faranno fede per l'utilizzo di quel Servizio, a meno che i Termini Aggiuntivi non dichiarino espressamente che siano questi Termini a fare fede.

### Bambini di Età Inferiore ai 13 Anni

Noi ci impegnamo nel ridurre al massimo la raccolta dei dati personali degli Utenti di età inferiore ai 13 anni, così come spiegato nella Code.org [privacy policy](http://code.org/privacy). Se hai meno di 13 anni ti chiediamo di chiedere l'approvazione dei tuoi genitori o dei tuoi tutori legali prima di creare un account su Code.org. Code.org permette ad alcuni responsabili dei distretti scolastici e delle scuole, ad esempio insegnanti, amministratori, counselors, e altri educatori (un “**Educatore**”), di entrare in contatti con gli studenti attraverso i Servizi, così da poter fornire servizi di tutoraggio, educativi, e simili. Se sei un Educatore, puoi registrare ai Servizi gli accounts di uno o più di uno dei tuoi studenti.

If you are an Educator and you register an account for a student who is under the age of 13 (a “**Child**”), you represent and warrant that you or the educational organization you work for has proper permission to register the Child for educational services, such as Code.org, that collect some of the Child’s personal information for the use and benefit of the school and for no other commercial purpose. In addition, you agree to be bound by these Terms on behalf of the educational organization you work for.

### Il tuo Account

Se registri un account per i Servizi, diventi responsabile della sicurezza del tuo account e della tua password. Se utilizzi un account che ti è stato dato da un Educatore, questi potrebbe essere capace di accedere al e di disabilitare il tuo account.

Code.org ti permette di registrare un account per i Servizi tramite l'utilizzo di servizi di terze parti, tipo Facebook Connect e Google (“**Servizio di Autenticazione**”). Registrandoti ai Servizi utilizzando un Servizio di Autenticazione, acconsenti all'accesso di Code.org alle informazioni del tuo account tramite il Servizio di Autenticazione, e acconsenti a ciascuno dei termini di utilizzo del Servizio di Autenticazione riguardo l'uso del Servizio tramite il Servizio di Autenticazione. Tu sei l'esclusivo responsabile delle tue interazioni con il Servizio di Autenticazione.

### Privacy

La tua privacy per noi è importante. L' [Informativa sulla Privacy](http://code.org/privacy) di Code.org spiega come trattiamo i tuoi dati personali, ed è integrata in questi Termini di riferimento. Ti preghiamo di leggere attentamente la nostra Privacy Policy, per essere informato su quanto fa capo alla raccolta, all'uso, ed alla trasmissione dei tuoi dati personali da parte di Code.org.

Se sei uno studente che utilizza un account registrato per te da un Educatore, o collegato in altro modo ad un Educatore, acconsenti che Code.org possa trasmettere i tuoi dati agli Educatori associati al tuo account. Se sei un Educatore, acconsenti a non condividere i dati dello studente che ricevi da Code.org con nessuno che non sia autorizzato dalla scuola, o dal distretto scolastico, o da qualche altra istituzione educativa che tu rappresenti.

Each of the subsections below only applies up to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties or the limitation of liability in contracts, and as a result the contents of this section may not apply to you. Nothing in this section is intended to limit any rights you may have which may not be lawfully limited.

THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SUBSECTION SHALL APPLY TO ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, STATUTE, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE CODE.ORG ENTITIES HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

SOME STATES OR OTHER JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

### General Terms

#### A. Waiver and Severability

The failure of Code.org to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
