<h1>How to teach one Hour of Code</h1>

Join the movement and introduce a group of students to their first hour of computer science with these steps. The Hour of Code is easy to run - even for beginners! If you'd like an extra set of hands to help out, you can find a [local volunteer](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/volunteer/local') %) to help run an Hour of Code in your class.

## 1. Watch this how-to video <iframe width="500" height="255" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/SrnvvWDm73k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen mark="crwd-mark"></iframe> 

## 2. Choose a tutorial for your hour

We provide a variety of fun, [student-guided tutorials](%= resolve_url('/learn') %) for all age groups and experience levels. Students do the activities on their own, though many activities include lesson plans for teachers (you'll see the link when you click the activity) to guide discussion or extend the activity. [![](/images/fit-700/tutorials.png)](%=resolve_url('/learn') %)

## 3. Promote your Hour of Code

Promote your Hour of Code [with these tools](%= resolve_url('/promote/resources') %) and encourage others to host their own events.

## 4. Plan your technology needs - computers are optional

The best Hour of Code experience includes Internet-connected computers. But you **don’t** need a computer for every child, and you can even do the Hour of Code without a computer at all.

Make sure to test tutorials on student computers or devices to ensure they work properly on browsers with sound and video. **Have low bandwidth?** Plan to show videos at the front of the class, so each student isn't downloading their own videos. Or try the unplugged / offline tutorials.

Provide headphones for your class, or ask students to bring their own, if the tutorial you choose works best with sound.

**Don't have enough devices?** Use [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q). When students partner up, they help each other and rely less on the teacher. They’ll also see that computer science is social and collaborative.

## 5. Start your Hour of Code off with an inspiring speaker or video

**Invite a [local volunteer](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/volunteer/local') %) to inspire your students by talking about the breadth of possibilities in computer science.** There are thousands of volunteers around the world ready to help with your Hour of Code through either a classroom visit or video chat with your students!

**Show an inspirational video:**

- The original Code.org launch video, featuring Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and NBA star Chris Bosh. (There are [1 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYZF6oIZtfc), [5 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc), and [9 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1xS07N-FA) versions available)
- Find more inspirational [resources](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/inspire') %) and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNfpD8i4Sx7U0y2MccnrNZuP).

**It’s okay if both you and your students are brand new to computer science. Here are some ideas to introduce your Hour of Code activity:**

- Explain ways that technology impacts our lives, with examples both boys and girls will care about (talk about saving lives, helping people, connecting people, etc.).
- As a class, list things that use code in everyday life.
- See tips for getting girls interested in computer science [here](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/girls')%).

## 6. Code!

**Direct students to the activity**

- Write the tutorial link on a whiteboard. Find the link listed on the [information for your selected tutorial](%= resolve_url('/learn')%) under the number of participants.

**When your students come across difficulties it's okay to respond:**

- “I don’t know. Let’s figure this out together.”
- “Technology doesn’t always work out the way we want.”
- “Learning to program is like learning a new language; you won’t be fluent right away.”

**What if a student finishes early?**

- Students can see all tutorials and [try another Hour of Code activity](%= resolve_url('/learn')%).
- Or, ask students who finish early to help classmates who are having trouble with the activity.

## Other Hour of Code resources for educators:

- Visit the [Hour of Code Teacher Forum](http://forum.code.org/c/plc/hour-of-code) to get advice, insight and support from other educators. <% if @country == 'us' %>
- Review the [Hour of Code FAQ](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/categories/200147083-Hour-of-Code). <% end %>

## What comes after the Hour of Code?

The Hour of Code is just the first step on a journey to learn more about how technology works and how to create software applications. To continue this journey:

- Encourage students to continue to [learn online](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/learn/beyond')%).
- [Attend](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/professional-development-workshops') %) a 1-day, in-person workshop to receive instruction from an experienced computer science facilitator. (US educators only)
