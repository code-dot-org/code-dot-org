#### (Based on Polya's Four Step Probelm Solving Process)

These tips will help you get unstuck when solving Code.org puzzles!

## Step 1: Understand the Puzzle

  * What does the puzzle want you to do?
  * Може ли да опишеш проблема със собствени думи?
  * С какъв код започнахте? 
      * Какво прави той?
      * Защо мислиш, че това е там?
  * Каква е целта на пъзела?
  * Have you solved any other puzzles that are like this one?

## Step 2: Create A Plan

#### (Pick one or more)

  * Write an algorithm.
  * Guess and check as you go.
  * Draw a picture of what you want to do.
  * Try working backward.
  * Solve one small piece at a time.
  * Compare to a puzzle that you've already solved.

## Step 3: Perform and Perfect the Plan

  * Did you solve the puzzle?
  * If not, hunt for one error at a time.
  * Retest your plan after every change.
  * If you start to get frustrated, take a deep breath, or leave your screen for a minute. When you come back, you may see what was causing the trouble!
  * Ask questions. Maybe one of your friends can help you figure out where your plan goes awry.

## Step 4: Check Your Work

  * Does your answer solve the puzzle?
  * Did you hit all of the goals of this puzzle?
  * Now that you know one way to solve the puzzle, is there an easier way to do it?
  * If you change this solution a little, will it work for any other puzzles?
  * Could you explain your solution to help someone else figure out the puzzle?
