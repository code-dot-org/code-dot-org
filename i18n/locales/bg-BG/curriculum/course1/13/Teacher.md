## Преглед на урока

Building on the concept of repeating instructions from Getting Loopy, this stage will have students using loops to more efficiently traverse the maze.

## Цели на урока

### Учениците ще:

  * Identify the benefits of using a loop structure instead of manual repetition
  * Create a program for a given task which loops a single command
  * Break down a long sequence of instructions into the smallest repeatable sequence possible
  * Create a program for a given task which loops a sequence of commands
  * Employ a combination of sequential and looped commands to reach the end of a maze

## Getting Started

### <a name="GetStarted"></a> Introduction

Review with students the Getting Loopy activity:

  * What are loops?
  * Why do we use them?

## Activity

### <a name="Activity"></a> [Maze: Loops](http://learn.code.org/s/course1/stage/13/puzzle/1)

As students work through the puzzles, see if they can figure out how many fewer blocks they use with a loop vs. not using a loop.

## Разширено обучение

<a name="Extended"></a>Използвайте тези дейности за подобряване на Ученическия климат в класа. Те могат да бъдат използвани и като извънкласни дейности или в друга форма.

### So Moving

  * Give the students pictures of actions or dance moves that they can do. 
      * Have students arrange moves and add loops to choreograph their own dance.
  * Share the dances with the rest of the class.

### Connect It Back

  * Find some YouTube videos of popular dances that repeat themselves.
  * Can your class find the loops?
  * Try the same thing with songs!
