## Getting Started

### <a name="GetStarted"></a> Introduction

  * Review The Big Event activity with students: 
      * What did we "program" the button click events to do?
  * Now we're going to add events to our coding, Specifically, we're going to have an event for when two characters touch each other. 
      * In video game programming we call this kind of event collision detection; it lets us decide what to do when one thing collides with, or touches, another.
      * What kinds of collision events have you seen in games?

# Съвет за урока

Students will have the opportunity to share their final product with a link. This is a great opportunity to show your school community the great things your students are doing. Collect all of the links and keep them on your class website for all to see!

## Activity

### <a name="Activity"></a> [Play Lab: Create a Story](http://learn.code.org/s/course1/stage/16/puzzle/1)

This is the most free-form plugged activity of the course. At the final stage students have the freedom to create a story of their own. You may want to provide structured guidelines around what kind of story to write, partiularly for students who are overwhelmed by too many options.

## Разширено обучение

<a name="Extended"></a>Използвайте тези дейности за подобряване на Ученическия климат в класа. Те могат да бъдат използвани и като извънкласни дейности или в друга форма.

### Look Under the Hood

When you share a link to your story, you also share all of the code that goes behind it. This is a great way for students to learn from each other.

  * Post links to completed stories online or on the board. 
      * Make a story of your own to share as well!
  * When students load up a link, have them click the "How it Works" button to see the code behind the story.
  * Discuss as a group the different ways your classmates coded their stories. 
      * What suprised you?
      * What would you like to try?
  * Choose someone else's story and build on it. (Don't worry, the original story will be safe.)
