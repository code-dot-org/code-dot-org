### So Moving

  * Give the students pictures of actions or dance moves that they can do. 
      * Have students arrange moves and add loops to choreograph their own dance.
  * Share the dances with the rest of the class.

### Connect It Back

  * Find some YouTube videos of popular dances that repeat themselves.
  * Can your class find the loops?
  * Try the same thing with songs!
