        text: Velkommen til din første times kodning! Lad os dykke direkte ind i din første smagsprøve af programmeringen.
      2:
        image: notes/hoc1_2.jpg
        text: Vi vil bruge Blockly, et visuel programmeringssprog hvor du trækker og slipper blokke for at skrive kode.
      3:
        image: notes/hoc1_3.jpg
        text: 'Det meste kode er skrevet, men Blockly er visuel. Hver blok svarer til en "rigtig" kodelinje.'
      4:
        image: notes/hoc1_4.jpg
        text: Du vil lære grundprincipperne for computer videnskab, begreber der anvendes overalt fra at lave apps til at kontrollere Mars Rover.

        image: notes/hoc1_5.jpg
        text: Et program er et sæt af instruktioner som din computer skal følge.
      6:
        image: notes/hoc1_6.jpg
        text: Målet for dit første program er at få en Angry Bird gennem en labyrint og ramme en grøn gris.
      7:
        image: notes/hoc1_7.jpg
        text: Venstre side er labyrinten, hvor programmet køres. Instruktionerne for hver gåde er under labyrinten.
      8:
        image: notes/hoc1_8.jpg
        text: "Den midterste værktøjskasse har kommandoerne for Angry Bird'en. Du skal bruge disse til at bygge din kode."
      9:
        image: notes/hoc1_9.jpg
        text: Til højre er dit arbejdsområde, hvor du kan trække blokke fra værktøjskasse til at bygge dit program. Hvis du vil slette en blok, skal du trække den til papirkurven i hjørnet.
      10:
        image: notes/hoc1_10.jpg
        text: |-
          Hver blok er en instruktion. Hvis du trækker en "flyt fremad"-blok til dit arbejdsområde og trykker på "Kør", bevæger Angry Bird'en sig en plads frem i labyrinten.
      11:
        image: notes/hoc1_11.jpg
        text: For at udføre mere end én handling, kan du trække mange blokke til dit arbejdsområde og knytte dem sammen. Fuglen vil udføre kommandoerne fra top til bund.
      12:
        image: notes/hoc1_12.jpg
        text: 'Hvis du kører et program og ønsker at ændre det og prøve igen, skal du trykke på knappen "Nulstil".'

        text: Hej, jeg hedder JR! Hvert racerbilsteam har brug for computereksperter for at vinde. De analyserer data fra bilen for at få den til at køre hurtigere.
      2:
        image: notes/stage5_2.jpg
        text: I disse gåder, vil du være en kunstner, der tegner en linje bag dem overalt de går.
      3:
        image: notes/stage5_3.jpg
        text: 'Denne blok siger "Flyt fremad med 100 pixel." Pixels er bare virkelig små prikker på din skærm.'
      4:
        image: notes/stage5_4.jpg
        text: 'Denne blok siger "Drej 90 grader til højre." Dette vil dreje din kunstner, på samme måde som "drej" blokken i labyrint gåderne.'
      5:
        image: notes/stage5_5.jpg
        text: Klik på pilen i en af disse blokke for at ændre hvor meget kunstneren bevæger sig fremad eller vender. Leg med det for at blive fortrolig med disse nye blokke.

        image: notes/stage9_1.jpg
        text: Hej, jeg er Paola! I disse gåder er du en landmand, der skal få hendes område helt fladt, så der kan plantes afgrøder.
      2:
        image: notes/stage9_2.jpg
        text: Du skal hjælpe hende med at fjerne alle bunker af snavs og udfylde alle hullerne.
      3:
        image: notes/stage9_3.jpg
        text: De nye blokke fjerner 1 skovlfuld snavs fra en bunke og fylder i 1 skovlfuld snavs i et hul.
      4:
        image: notes/stage9_4.jpg
        text: Bunkerne og hullerne er forskellige størrelser, så du skal fortælle landmanden hvor mange skovlfulde der skal bruges.
    flappy_intro:
      1:
        image: notes/flappy01.jpg
        text: Hej, jeg er Katie! En af de mest spændende ting ved datalogi er, at computerprogrammer kan være interaktive.
      2:
        image: notes/flappy02.jpg
        text: Hver gang der klikkes, trykkes eller skriver på en computer eller telefon, indtræffer en hændelse. og der er noget kode som bestemmer hvad der skal ske når hændelsen indtræffer.
      3:
        image: notes/flappy03.jpg
        text: 'For eksempel, du kunne have en HÆNDELSESHÅNDTERING, der siger "når der klikkes på musen, spil en lyd" '
      4:
        image: notes/flappy04.jpg
        text: Har du nogensinde hørt om spillet FlappyBird? Ved hjælp af hændelseshandlere, vil vi lære at programmere vores egen version af FlappyBird!
      5:
        image: notes/flappy05.jpg
        text: Den kode, du kommer til at skrive indebærer at trække og slippe blokke, der repræsenterer kommandoer til computeren. Under kølerhjelmen, er hver af disse blokke repræsenteret af reel kode.
      6:
        image: notes/flappy06.jpg
        text: 'Hvis du tager et kig på arbejdsområdet, der er nogle grønne blokke, der er udfyldt for dig - disse er "hændelseshåndteringer" '
      7:
        image: notes/flappy07.jpg
        text: 'Hvis du vil få fuglen til at FLAPPE når du klikker med musen, kan du gøre det ved at knytte "flap"-blokken til den passende hændelseshåndtering. Så vil fuglen flappe hver gang du klikker med musen i dit spil.'
      8:
        image: notes/flappy08.jpg
        text: I hver opgave i denne aktivitet vil vi introducere nye typer af hændelser som grønne blokke på arbejdsområdet, og du kan vælge passende blokke at tilføje som reaktion på disse hændelser.
      9:
        image: notes/flappy09.jpg
        text: 'Når du ser en fald-ned pil som denne betyder det, at du kan ændre indstillinger - f.eks. hvilken lyd der afspilles når flappy rammer jorden.'
      10:
        image: notes/flappy10.jpg
        text: I den sidste opgave vil du kunne lave dit eget spil og dele det med dine venner. God fornøjelse!

        text: 'Kan vi sætte "Flyt fremad" blokken ind i "gentag" blokken og skrive et tal i blokken for at fortælle hvor mange gange det skal gentages.'
      6:

        text: |-
          Hvis vi sætter en "Flyt fremad" blok inden i "Gentag indtil"-blokken, så vil Angry Bird'en bevæge sig fremad indtil den når til grisen (eller styrter ind i en væg).
      4:

        text: Vi kan bede zombien kontrollere, om der er en sti til venstre, og hvis han finder en sti til venstre, kan vi få ham til at dreje i retningen.

        text: 'Nu, hvis vi sætter en "gå frem" blok over det og en "gentag" blok omkring alt, så hver gang zombien bevæger sig, vil han kontrollere, om der er en vej til venstre og dreje. Kommandoen "Gentag" er kritisk, for at kontrollere om der skal drejes for hvert skridt.'
      6:
        image: notes/hoc4_6.jpg
        text: Hvis-sætninger er rigtigt vigtige i computer videnskab. Et af de første programmer jeg skrev var et kryds og bolle spil, og der var en hvis-sætning, der sagde, at hvis den anden person er ved at vinde, bloker den plads, der lader dem vinde.

HVIS der er en sti forude, vil zombien vil bevæge sig fremad, og ELLERS (altså hvis der ikke er en sti forude), vil zombien dreje til venstre.'

        text: Dette betyder, at vores kunstner vil tegne en firkant, der har 50 pixel længde sider, så vil tilføje 10 til det og tegne en firkant med 60 pixel længde sider. Så vil det blive ved med at tilføje 10 og tegne firkanter, indtil det når 90. Så vil vi have kvadrater af 50, 60, 70, 80 og 90.

For at kunne gøre det, skal du sætte "flyt fremad"- og "drej til højre"-blokkene ind i en "gentag"-blok.'

        text: One of the most important concepts in computer science is how to define new commands, how to add your own words to a computer language. Most computer languages have only about one hundred words or commands. The art and magic is in defining your own new words out of these building blocks.

        text: "We do this all the time in sports. For example, in basketball, you start by learning how to dribble, how to do a lay-up, how to rebound. Once you've learned these really basic moves, you learn new moves and put together these building blocks, like a pick and roll or give and go. You can then go from there to do more complex plays. Once you learn that play and give it a name, everybody on the team knows how to do it."

When you define your own command and give it a name, that's called a function. Now we're going to use functions to help the bee."

In this lesson, you'll create an algorithm for a dice race game. Then you'll ask your friends to try out your plan to see if they can follow the steps to play the game. After the programmer is sure the steps are correct, it's time to translate the algorithm into a program with language that the computer can understand."

An algorithm has to be translated into a program before a computer can run it. Breaking a task into steps called an algorithm is sometimes difficult.

Most people have a lot of contacts, you might have say, 1000 contacts and we don't want to send all of those contacts at once to your phone because it's too large of a message. Similar to the way the internet breaks large messages down into packets, we use a concept called paging where we might only send your phone 100 contacts at a time and let your phone respond to us and ask for the next 100."
