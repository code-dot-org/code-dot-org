## Hvordan kan du få medieopmærksomhed om dit Hour of Code arrangement

*For alle henvendelser fra presse og medier, kontakt venligst <press@code.org> på engelsk*

### Vigtige Tips

- Send mails til medierne to uger før dit arrangement. Følg op med e-mails og telefonopkald, hvis du ikke modtager svar på den første henvendelse.
- Bed skolens ansatte tage billeder og dele dem online eller som trykt materiale.
- Skriv om Hour of Code på din hjemmeside og i din skoles avis. Skriv om dit arrangement og brug billeder af elevaktiviteter.
- Del opslag om begivenheder med billeder på Facebook og Twitter fra 5. til 11. december. Brug hashtag **#HourOfCode** så Code.org kan se og dele dine opslag.

### Trin for trin vejledning:

**1. Planlæg dit arrangement**

- Planlæg et fælles kick off arrangement for Hour of Code.
- Send [et brev](%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#sample-emails') %) til forældrene og bed dem dele videre.
- Send [a letter](%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#sample-emails') %) to invite your local mayor, congressman, governor, or influential businessperson to attend and speak to your students.
- Organisere gruppeaktiviteter (som for eksempel en demonstration af en "unplugged" programmeringsaktivitet), eller vis elevaktiviteterne.
- Show Code.org’s [Hour of Code video](%= resolve_url('/') %) or one of [these](%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#videos') %) to inspire.

**2. Identify specific local reporters that cover education or local events.**

Think a local newspaper, TV station, radio station or blog.

Look online to find reporter contact information. If you can't find it, call the publication to ask, or email a general tips@PUBLICATIONNAME.com email address and ask for your message to be directed to the correct reporter.

**3. Contact local media**

The best way to reach out is by email. It should be short and communicate: why should other people care about this event? Include contact information (including a cellphone number) for who will be on site at the event. **See a [sample pitch to media](%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#sample-emails') %).**

**4. Prepare to field questions about your school event. Here are some examples:**

*Why is your school doing an Hour of Code?*

While all of us know that it’s important for students to learn how to navigate today’s tech-saturated world, many teachers aren’t experienced in computer science and don’t know where to start. This event is a chance for all of us to see what computer science is about.

We hope it’ll spark interest in students to keep learning. Research also shows that kids can pick up programming concepts before they know how to read and write. In fact, their brains are more receptive to computer languages at a young age, just like foreign languages.

*Why is this important?*

Technology is transforming every industry on the planet. In 2015, 7 million openings in the U.S. were in occupations—including art and design—that value coding skills. But 75 percent of schools in the U.S. don't teach computer science. It’s time for us to catch up to the 21st century. We know that regardless of what our students do when they grow up, whether they go into medicine, business, politics, or the arts, knowing how to build technology will give them confidence and a competitive edge.

**More details and a quote you can use in materials**

"The Hour of Code is designed to demystify code and show that computer science is not rocket science—anybody can learn the basics," said Hadi Partovi, founder and CEO of Code.org. "Over 100 million students worldwide have tried an Hour of Code. The demand for relevant 21st century computer science education crosses all borders and knows no boundaries."

**About Code.org**

Code.org is a 501c3 public non-profit dedicated to expanding participation in computer science and increasing participation by women and underrepresented students of color. Its vision is that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer programming. After launching in 2013, Code.org organized the Hour of Code campaign – which has introduced over 100 million students to computer science to date – and partnered with 70 public school districts nationwide to expand computer science programs. Code.org is supported by philanthropic donations from corporations, foundations and generous individuals, including Microsoft, Infosys Foundation, USA, The Ballmer Family Giving, Omidyar Network and others.
