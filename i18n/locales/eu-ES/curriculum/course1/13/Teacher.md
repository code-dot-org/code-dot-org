## Lesson Overview

Building on the concept of repeating instructions from Getting Loopy, this stage will have students using loops to more efficiently traverse the maze.

## Lesson Objectives

### Students will:

  * Identify the benefits of using a loop structure instead of manual repetition
  * Create a program for a given task which loops a single command
  * Break down a long sequence of instructions into the smallest repeatable sequence possible
  * Create a program for a given task which loops a sequence of commands
  * Employ a combination of sequential and looped commands to reach the end of a maze

## Getting Started

### <a name="GetStarted"></a> Introduction

Review with students the Getting Loopy activity:

  * What are loops?
  * Why do we use them?

## Activity

### <a name="Activity"></a> [Maze: Loops](http://learn.code.org/s/course1/stage/13/puzzle/1)

As students work through the puzzles, see if they can figure out how many fewer blocks they use with a loop vs. not using a loop.

## Extended Learning

<a name="Extended"></a>Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### So Moving

  * Give the students pictures of actions or dance moves that they can do. 
      * Have students arrange moves and add loops to choreograph their own dance.
  * Share the dances with the rest of the class.

### Connect It Back

  * Find some YouTube videos of popular dances that repeat themselves.
  * Can your class find the loops?
  * Try the same thing with songs!

### Common Core Math Standards

  * K.CC.B.4 - Understand the relationship between numbers and quantities; connect counting to cardinality.
  * K.OA.A.3 - Decompose numbers less than or equal to 10 into pairs in more than one way, e.g., by using objects or drawings, and record each decomposition by a drawing or equation (e.g., 5 = 2 + 3 and 5 = 4 + 1).
  * K.OA.A.5 - Fluently add and subtract within 5.
  * K.G.A.1 - Describe objects in the environment using names of shapes, and describe the relative positions of these objects using terms such as above, below, beside, in front of, behind, and next to.
  * 1.OA.A.1 - Use addition and subtraction within 20 to solve word problems involving situations of adding to, taking from, putting together, taking apart, and comparing, with unknowns in all positions, e.g., by using objects, drawings, and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem.
  * 2.OA.A.1 - Use addition and subtraction within 100 to solve one- and two-step word problems involving situations of adding to, taking from, putting together, taking apart, and comparing, with unknowns in all positions, e.g., by using drawings and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem.
  * 2.G.A.2 - Partition a rectangle into rows and columns of same-size squares and count to find the total number of them.

### Common Core Language Arts Standards

  * SL.K.1 - Participate in collaborative conversations with diverse partners about kindergarten topics and texts with peers and adults in small and larger groups.
