# How to attract media to your Hour of Code event

### Make a splash with your Hour of Code event and invite local media to see why computer science is important at your school.

## Key Tips

- Oslovte média dva týdny před událostí prostřednictvím e-mailu. Zkuste to znovu e-mailem a telefonicky, pokud nedostanete prvotní odpověď.
- Požádejte zaměstnance školy nebo dobrovolníky, aby fotili a sdíleli fotky online nebo je poslali do tisku.
- Napište o Hodině kódu na domovské stránce vašich webových stránek a ve školních novinách. Pošlete podrobnosti o vaší akci a fotky ze žákovských aktivit.
- On Facebook and Twitter, share updates on your plans, announce your events, and post pictures during {{ campaign_date/year }}. Use the hashtag **#HourOfCode** so Code.org can see and promote your events.

## Step-by-step guide

### 1. Plan your event

- Naplánujte si, jak udělat kick off Hodiny kódu.
- Send [a letter]({{ promote/sample_emails }}) to parents and ask them to spread the word.
- Send [a letter]({{ promote/sample_emails }}) to invite your local mayor, member of Congress, governor, or influential businessperson to attend and speak to your students.
- Organizujte skupinové aktivity (např. ukázku offline programování), nebo představte studenty vytvořené a vedené projekty.
- Show Code.org’s [Hour of Code video]({{ urls/home }}) or one of [these videos]({{ promote/videos }}) to inspire students. <br />

### 2. Identify specific reporters that cover education or local events

Like local newspapers, TV station or radio stations, or blogs. <br />

### 3. Contact local media

The best way to reach out is by email. It should be short and should communicate "why should other people care about this event"? Include contact information (including a cellphone number) for who will be on site at the event. **[See a sample pitch to media]({{ promote/press-kit-emails }})**.

Look online to find reporter contact information. If you can't find it, call the publication to ask, or email the organization's general email address and ask for your message to be directed to the correct reporter. <br />

### 4. Prepare to field questions about your school event. Here are some examples:

#### Why is your school doing an Hour of Code?

While all of us know that it’s important for students to learn how to navigate today’s tech-saturated world, many teachers aren’t experienced in computer science and don’t know where to start. This event is a chance for all of us to see what computer science is about.

We hope it’ll spark interest in students to keep learning. Research also shows that kids can pick up programming concepts before they know how to read and write. In fact, their brains are more receptive to computer languages at a young age, just like foreign languages. <br /> <br />

#### Why is this important?

Technology is transforming every industry on the planet. In 2015, 7 million openings in the U.S. were in occupations—including art and design—that value coding skills. But 60 percent of schools in the U.S. don't teach computer science. It’s time for us to catch up to the 21st-century. We know that regardless of what our students do when they grow up, whether they go into medicine, business, politics, or the arts, knowing how to build technology will give them confidence and a competitive edge. <br />

## Sample email to send to invite local media to your event

**Subject line**: Local school joins mission to introduce students to computer science

Computers are everywhere, changing every industry on the planet, but fewer than half of all schools teach computer science. Young women and students from marginalized racial and ethnic groups are severely underrepresented in computer science classes, and in the tech industry. Dobrou zprávou je, že jsme na cestě, jak to změnit.

With the Hour of Code, computer science has been on homepages of Google, MSN, Yahoo!, and Disney. Over 100 partners have joined together to support this movement. Každý Apple Store na světě už pořádal Hodinu programování. Even President Obama wrote his first line of code as part of the campaign.

Proto se všech [X number] studentů z [SCHOOL NAME] účastní největší vzdělávací akce v historii, Hodiny kódu, během Týdne vzdělávání v informatice (3.–9. prosince).

I'm writing to invite you to attend our kickoff assembly and to see kids start the activity on [DATE].

Hodina programování, kterou pořádá nezisková společnost Code.org a více než 100 dalších, je globální hnutí, které věří, že dnešní studenti jsou připraveni naučit se dovednosti kriticky nezbytné pro úspěch v 21. století. Please join us.

I look forward to being in touch. <br />

## Additional details and a quote you can use in materials

"The Hour of Code is designed to demystify code and show that computer science is not rocket science—anybody can learn the basics," said Hadi Partovi, founder and CEO of Code.org. "Over 100 million students worldwide have tried an Hour of Code. The demand for relevant 21st-century computer science education crosses all borders and knows no boundaries." <br /> <br />
