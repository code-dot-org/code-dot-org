## Useful stats on computer science

*For all press and media inquiries, contact <press@code.org>*

### Key Tips

  * Reach out to media two weeks before your event via email. Follow up by email and phone if you don't receive an initial response.
  * Ask a school staff member or volunteer to take photos to share online or send to press.
  * Write about the Hour of Code on your website’s homepage and in your school newspaper. Post your event details, and pictures of student activities.
  * On Facebook and Twitter, share updates on your plans, announce your events and post pictures during Dec. 8-14. Use the hashtag **#HourOfCode** so Code.org can see and promote your events.

### Step-by-step guide:

**1. Plan your event**

  * Plan an assembly to kick off the Hour of Code.
  * Send [a letter](<%= hoc_uri('/resources/#sample-emails') %>) to parents. Ask them to spread the word.
  * Send [a letter](<%= hoc_uri('/resources/#sample-emails') %>) to invite your local mayor, congressman, governor, or influential businessperson to attend and speak to your students.
  * Organize group activities (like a demonstration of an ‘unplugged’ programming activity), or show off student-created and led activities.
  * Show Code.org’s [Hour of Code video](<%= hoc_uri('/') %>) or one of [these](<%= hoc_uri('/resources#videos') %>) to inspire.

**2. Identify specific local reporters that cover education or local events.**

Think a local newspaper, TV station, radio station or blog.

Look online to find reporter contact information. If you can't find it, call the publication to ask, or email a general tips@PUBLICATIONNAME.com email address and ask for your message to be directed to the correct reporter.

**3. Contact local media**

The best way to reach out is by email. It should be short and communicate: why should other people care about this event? Include contact information (including a cellphone number) for who will be on site at the event. **See a [sample pitch to media](<%= hoc_uri('/resources#sample-emails') %>):**

**4. Prepare to field questions about your school event. Here are some examples:**

*Why is your school doing an Hour of Code?*

While all of us know that it’s important for students to learn how to navigate today’s tech-saturated world, many teachers aren’t experienced in computer science and don’t know where to start. This event is a chance for all of us to see what computer science is about.

We hope it’ll spark interest in students to keep learning. Research also shows that kids pick up programming concepts before they know how to read and write. In fact, their brains are more receptive to computer languages at a young age, just like foreign languages.

*Why is this important?*

In China, every students takes computer science to graduate high school. In the U.S., 90 percent of schools don’t even teach it. It’s time for us to catch up to the 21st century. We know that regardless of what our students do when they grow up, whether they go into medicine, business, politics, or the arts, knowing how to build technology will give them the confidence and know-how to succeed.

**More details and a quote you can use in materials**

"The Hour of Code is designed to demystify code and show that computer science is not rocket-science, anybody can learn the basics," said Hadi Partovi, founder and CEO of Code.org. "In one week last year, 15 million students tried an Hour of Code. Now we're aiming for 100 million worldwide to prove that the demand for relevant 21st century computer science education crosses all borders and knows no boundaries."

**About Code.org**

Code.org® is a 501c3 public non-profit dedicated to expanding participation in computer science and increasing participation by women and underrepresented students of color. Its vision is that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer programming. After launching in 2013, Code.org organized the Hour of Code campaign — which has introduced millions of students to computer science — partnered with more than 30 public school districts nationwide, and launched Code Studio, an open-source, online learning platform for all ages.
