        title: Úvod do počítačové vědy
        desc: Tato lekce představí koncept informatiky a vysvětlí, co dělají počítačoví vědci. Také dá studentům možnost zaujmout roli počítačového vědce. Na konci lekce každý student dostane shrnutí toho, co se naučil. Možná, že nebudete chtít dětem vysvětlovat termíny, které se budou v lekcích vyskytovat, ale když je jim představíte zábavně a hravě, bude to mnohem lepší, než když budete čekat na pozdější příležitost.

        title: Aritmetické Myšlení
        desc: With nothing but paper and markers, students will learn the four steps of computational thinking. After a brief introduction, students should be split into groups where they will have to create directions for other students to draw a specific monster (from a catalog of pre-selected monsters). The entire task must be decomposed, then teams will analyze all monsters in the catalog for patterns, abstract different details from the monsters, then use that information to create an algorithm (directions) for another team to draw a certain monster. Teams will then switch algorithms with another group and draw the monster based on what that algorithm indicates. Is the drawing what the original team intended?

        desc: "By programming one another to draw pictures, students will begin to understand what programming is really about. The class will begin by students instructing each other to color squares in on graph paper in an effort to reproduce an existing picture.  If there's time, the lesson can conclude with images that the students create themselves."

        desc: 'This lesson covers algorithms.  Using tangram shapes and graph paper, the first exercise will show how important it is to make each instruction as clear and unambiguous as possible.  Afterward, the class will explore how many ways you can fold paper into a rectangle, noting how some methods can take more or fewer folds than others.'

        title: Funkce
        desc: |-
          In this lesson, students will make a suncatcher out of string, beads, and a special charm. The students will follow a series of repetitive steps, then be asked to identify certain sets of "skills" that are duplicated several times. Once those skills are defined, they will be called from a main program and the whole beautiful process of creation will be recorded on a single sheet of paper. The final program will be geared toward the entire class, whatever their type of string, beads, and charms. To effectively allow for this, students will need to "abstract out" the details of their specific materials and create vague terms for an individual's supplies.  This use of generic placeholders is a wonderful introduction to variables.
