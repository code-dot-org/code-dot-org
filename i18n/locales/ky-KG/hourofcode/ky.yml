  oceans_behind_the_scenes_1: Levels 2-4 use a pretrained model provided by the <a
    href="https://www.tensorflow.org/" >TensorFlow</a> <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/slim/nets/mobilenet_v1.md">
    MobileNet </a> project. A MobileNet model is a <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/practica/image-classification/convolutional-neural-networks">convolutional
    neural network</a> that has been trained on <a href="http://www.image-net.org/">ImageNet</a>,
    a dataset of over 14 million images hand-annotated with words such as "balloon"
    or "strawberry". In order to customize this model with the labeled training data
    the student generates in this activity, we use a technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning">Transfer
    Learning</a>. Each image in the training dataset is fed to MobileNet, as pixels,
    to obtain a list of annotations that are most likely to apply to it. Then, for
    a new image, we feed it to MobileNet and compare its resulting list of annotations
    to those from the training dataset. We classify the new image with the same label
    (such as "fish" or "not fish") as the images from the training set with the most
    similar results.
  oceans_behind_the_scenes_1_markdown: Levels 2-4 use a pretrained model provided
    by the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) [MobileNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/slim/nets/mobilenet_v1.md)

    14 million images hand-annotated with words such as "balloon" or "strawberry".

  oceans_behind_the_scenes_2: Levels 6-8 use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine">Support-Vector
    Machine</a> (SVM). We look at each component of the fish (such as eyes, mouth,
    body) and assemble all of the metadata for the components (such as number of teeth,
    body shape) into a vector of numbers for each fish. We use these vectors to train
    the SVM. Based on the training data, the SVM separates the "space" of all possible
    fish into two parts, which correspond to the classes we are trying to learn (such
    as "blue" or "not blue").

  tenth_anniversary_testimonials_01: I had a high school student come up to me four
    years after I had her as an 8th grade middle schooler and she was excited that
    she was going to study computer science in college. As a middle schooler she was
    exposed to something new, and that planted a seed for her college years.
  tenth_anniversary_testimonials_02: I joined Hour of Code in your inaugural year
    and have been with you all the way! It has inspired me to seek out additional
    coding opportunities for my students. Thanks for all you have done to get kids
    engaged and excited about computer science! We wouldn't be where we are without
    you!
  tenth_anniversary_testimonials_03: I owe Code.org so much. I'm the teacher I am
    today because of the tools you provide for educators like me. I've been using
    Code.org since 2013 and I've been a facilitator since 2019. Thanks for making
    me look good for these many years, Code.org. I really appreciate it.
  farsi_page_top_heading: Code.org in Farsi
  farsi_page_top_heading_02: Talent is everywhere, but opportunity is not. Code.org
    in Farsi opens a door to an opportunity that would otherwise be closed.
  farsi_page_top_desc: Today, there are over 110 million Farsi speakers worldwide.
    While the majority of native speakers live in Iran, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan,
    there are millions living as immigrants, migrants, and refugees around the world.
    With the Code.org in Farsi initiative, Farsi-speaking students will have the same
    access to our curricula that is already available to students in all other major
    languages of the world.
  farsi_page_global_heading: The Global Impact of Iranians in Education & Technology
  farsi_page_global_desc_01: When you think of an algorithm, you may assume it's something
    new, but the concept of an algorithm was discovered in Iran over 1300 years ago.
    “Algorithm” is named after its inventor, the mathematician Al Khwarizmi, who lived
    in the land formerly known as Persia and now known as Iran. Once the epicenter
    of mathematics, science, philosophy, and medicine, Iran has made profound advances
    and impacts in technology.
  farsi_page_global_desc_02: Beyond the borders of the country itself, Iranians around
    the world have contributed in countless ways to science and technology — as co-founders
    or CEOs of technology companies such as Uber, eBay, Intuit, and Dropbox, or inventing
    technologies such as LASIK surgery or JPEG compression, or in scientific, academic,
    or engineering roles around the globe.
  farsi_page_global_desc_03: Finally, Code.org is led by Iranian American Hadi Partovi
    and has grown to become one of the largest education nonprofits globally.

  farsi_page_founders_heading: Our Founders' Story
  farsi_page_founders_slide_01: Born in Iran, Hadi and Ali Partovi grew up during
    the Iran-Iraq war. Their neighborhood in Tehran was bombed by Iraqi fighter jets.
  farsi_page_founders_slide_02: When they were 9 years old, their father, a physics
    professor, brought home a Commodore 64 computer from a trip abroad. This computer
    was their escape from their surroundings – they learned how to code and create
    apps, games, and music.
  farsi_page_founders_slide_03: They immigrated to the United States at age 11. Soon
    after they turned 15, they spent their summers working as software engineers to
    help pay their way through high school and college.
  farsi_page_founders_slide_04: Upon graduating from Harvard University with Masters
    degrees in computer science, Hadi and Ali pursued careers in technology.
  farsi_page_founders_slide_05: They attained success in the technology industry and
    founded numerous tech businesses, accomplishing the American dream. Additionally,
    they became prolific angel investors, backing companies such as Facebook, Uber,
    Airbnb, and Dropbox, among others.
  farsi_page_founders_slide_06: In 2013, Hadi and Ali launched the education nonprofit
    Code.org, which Hadi continues to lead as CEO. Since its inception, Code.org has
    started a massive movement to teach computer science and coding to K-12 students
    globally. It is also the largest provider of computer  science curricula in the
    world, with over 80 million student users in 180 countries.

  farsi_page_compliance_heading: Compliance In Support Of Farsi Translations
  farsi_page_compliance_desc: As a U.S. nonprofit, Code.org is subject to laws regarding
    sanctions with Iran. After consulting with U.S. legal counsel experienced in the
    Iranian Sanctions and Translations Regulations (ITSR), Code.org believes that
    it may fund, prepare, and distribute the Farsi Translations of CS Curriculum in
    the United States and elsewhere around the world, including within Iran. The ITSR
    provides an exemption for “information and informational materials” (the IIM Exemption)
    and Code.org believes that this exemption will fully shield its funding, preparation,
    and distribution of the Farsi Translations and thus enable its Farsi Translations
    effort to proceed in full compliance with U.S. economic sanctions requirements.

  csp_page_faq_question_04: What is the recommended timing for teaching CS Principles?
  csp_page_faq_answer_04_01: We recommend that CS Principles be taught as a full year
    class, assuming that you meet with students daily or nearly daily for 45 or more
    minutes.
  csp_page_faq_answer_04_02: It is possible to teach CS Principles on a semester block
    schedule, though we highly recommend this implementation only be used in the fall
    semester. Since the AP Performance Tasks are due in late April and require 20
    dedicated hours of class time to complete, most schools find there is not enough
    time to complete the course on a block schedule in the spring.
  csp_page_faq_question_05: What materials do I need for CS Principles?
  csp_page_faq_answer_05_01: CS Principles requires that students have access to computers
    with a modern web browser. At this time, our courses are not optimized for tablets
    or mobile devices. For more details, [check out Code.org's technology requirements](%{it_url}).

  csp_page_faq_question_07: How was the curriculum developed?
  csp_page_faq_answer_07_01: Our CS Principles curriculum has always been designed
    as part of a broader vision of supporting high quality, engaging, and equitable
    computer science instruction in classrooms across the country. Our [Curriculum
    Values](%{curriculum_url}) continue to guide us, and in particular our focus on
    expanding access to those who historically have been denied opportunities to learn
    about the exciting and impactful field of computing. While our vision and values
    remain unchanged, the landscape of CS education is rapidly developing.
  csp_page_faq_answer_07_02: For the 2020-21 school year the College Board has made
    some significant updates to the CS Principles framework and AP assessment to ensure
    that CS Principles remains relevant and aligned with equivalent university courses.
    CS education research continues to reveal new insights on how students learn about
    computing, and feedback from the thousands of classrooms now using our CS Principles
    curriculum has identified opportunities to further improve our courses, tools,
    and recommended pedagogy.
  csp_page_faq_answer_07_03: The goal of the updates to our curriculum is to navigate
    these developments in a way that remains committed to our vision and values and
    supports the many teachers, schools, classrooms, and districts that are already
    a part of our broader CS Principles community. We remain deeply thankful for you
    joining us on this mission to make our collective vision a reality.
  csp_page_faq_answer_07_04: For more information about our goals and approach to
    our courses, please see our [Curriculum Values](%{curriculum_url}) and our [Professional

    classroom
  csd_page_pick_a_course_desc: With the diverse set of options offered for CS Discoveries,
    there is a course for all different needs.
  csd_page_pick_a_course_heading_02: How do you want to pick the content?
  csd_page_courses_year_desc: Through 7 units students explore a wide variety of topics.
  csd_page_courses_year_action_block_desc: 'An introductory computer science course
    that empowers students to create authentic artifacts and engage with computer
    science as a medium for creativity, communication, problem solving, and fun. '
  csd_page_courses_flexible_units_desc: Each unit of CS Discoveries can be used on
    its own with no prior experience required, which allows you to pick the exact
    units that work for your classroom.
  csd_page_courses_collections_desc: Dive deeper into one area with a set of units
    focused on a specific topic.
  csd_page_faq_question_01: Is CS Discoveries mapped to standards?
  csd_page_faq_answer_01: CS Discoveries was written using both the K-12 Framework
    for Computer Science and the 2017 CSTA standards as guidance. Currently, every
    lesson in CS Discoveries contains mappings to the relevant 2017 CSTA standards.
    [A summary of standards mappings can be found here](%{mappings_url}). A Google
    Sheets version of the standards can be found at [CSD Standards](%{csd_standards_url}).
  csd_page_faq_question_02: How/Where can I get professional development for this
    course?
  csd_page_faq_answer_02: Our Professional Learning Program offers year-round support.
    The program kicks off with a five-day summer workshop where you'll have an opportunity
    to work hands-on with the curriculum and meet other teachers from your area. Throughout
    the year, we offer follow up workshops and forum support. You don't need any prior
    computer science experience to get started. And teachers love it! 90% rank it
    the best professional development ever. [Click here to apply and learn more](%{apply_url}).
  csd_page_faq_question_03: I'm teaching CS Discoveries but have less than one semester
    with my students. What would you recommend?
  csd_page_faq_answer_03_01: Teachers who have a restricted schedule, unable to teach
    all units of CS Discoveries over the course of a school year, can now easily assign
    a specific set of CS Discoveries units based on what they want to focus on. These
    collections are still the same exact units found in CS Discoveries, simply grouped
    together based on our recommendations below to dive deep in a specific area of
    CS Discoveries. Each collection is approximately one semester or slightly less
    than one semester. [Click here to see our Collections options](%{collections_url}).
  csd_page_faq_answer_03_02: For teachers who have an even more restricted schedule,
    they have the ability to assign just one unit at a time from CS Discoveries without
    assigning the entire course. We hope this helps support classrooms that teach
    units of CS Discoveries embedded as part of larger courses or when teaching computer
    science on a limited schedule. [Click here to see our flexible units](%).
  csd_page_faq_question_04: What materials and supplies are required for CS Discoveries?
  csd_page_faq_answer_04_01: One potential cost to consider when teaching this course
    is printing. Many lessons have handouts that are designed to guide students through
    activities. While it is not required that all of these handouts be printed, many
    were designed to be printed and we highly recommend printing when possible.
  csd_page_faq_answer_04_02: 'Beyond printing, some lessons call for typical classroom
    supplies and manipulatives such as: Student journals, poster paper, markers/colored
    pencils, scissors, scrap paper, glue or tape, post-it notes or index cards (or
    similar sized scrap paper), and rulers or a straight edge of some kind.'
  csd_page_faq_answer_04_03: 'In addition to those general course materials, the following
    items are called for in specific units:'
  csd_page_faq_answer_04_04: Problem Solving and Computing
  csd_page_faq_answer_04_05: Aluminum foil, container for water, pennies (note that
    pennies can be replaced with some other kind of weight of the same size). Alternate
    activities are available if you do not have access to these supplies.
  csd_page_faq_answer_04_06: Creating Apps with Devices (Option A and Option B)
  csd_page_faq_answer_04_07: 'Option A: Classroom set of Circuit Playgrounds. Check
    out [code.org/maker/circuitplayground](%{url}) for more details.'
  csd_page_faq_answer_04_08: 'Option B: Classroom set of micro:bit devices. Check
    out [code.org/maker/microbit](%{url}) for more details.'
  csd_page_faq_answer_04_09: Maker supplies, such as empty tissue boxes or cardboard
    rolls or scratch paper
  csd_page_faq_answer_04_10: "*Note: The Creating Apps with Devices unit has two implementation
    options - one for those using circuit playgrounds and one for those using micro:bit.
    Teachers should not buy both sets of devices or teach both unit options as they
    are equivalent and cover the same content."
  csd_page_faq_question_06: How does CS Discoveries fit with the other Code.org courses?
  csd_page_faq_answer_06_01: CS Discoveries is designed to fit naturally between our
    [CS Fundamentals](%{csf_url}) courses and our [CS Principles](%{csp_url}) course.
    While each of these courses is designed to be an age-appropriate entry point to
    computer science, students with previous experience will find many new topics
    to explore, and they will revisit familiar topics in novel and more challenging

  hoc_faq_what_is_hoc_q: Код сааты деген эмне?
  hoc_faq_what_is_hoc_a: Код сааты - компүтердик илим менен тааныштыруу, анын негиздерин
    ар ким өздөштүрө ала тургандыгын, "код жазуу" татаал эместигин көрсөтүү жана буга
    кеңири катмарларды тартуу үчүн уюштурулган бир сааттык иш-чара катары башталган.
    Алгачкы жолкусунан тартып эле 1 сааттык код жазуу иш-чарасы компүтердик илимди
    майрамдоонун дүйнөлүк аракетине айланып кетти. Бул <a href='%{tutorials}'> жетектемелерди

    өнөк</a> жана 200 000 мугалим колдоого алган.
  hoc_faq_what_is_hoc_a_markdown: The Hour of Code started as a one-hour introduction
    to computer science, designed to demystify "code", to show that anybody can learn
    the basics, and to broaden participation in the field of computer science. It
    has since become a worldwide effort to celebrate computer science, starting with
    1-hour coding activities but expanding to all sorts of community efforts. Check
    out the [tutorials and activities](%{tutorials}). This grassroots campaign is
    supported by over [400 partners](%{partners}) and 200,000 educators worldwide.

  hoc_faq_high_school_a_markdown: Our Star Wars and Minecraft tutorials are great
    for high schoolers, especially the Star Wars JavaScript version and the free play
    level on both tutorials. Alternately, we recommend trying one of the beginner
    tutorials on [%{partner_url}/learn](%{codeorg_url}/learn) to start, such as the

  hoc_faq_map_q: Эмнеге менин ордум картада көрүнбөйт?
  hoc_faq_map_a: Иш-чараңар Код саатынын картасында көрсөтүлбөгөнү үчүн кечирим сурайбыз.
    Анткени, карта катталган он миңдеген уюштуруучулардын маалыматтарын бириктирип,
    бир нече иш-чараны бир орун катары көрсөтөт. Картанын үстүндөгү санды бассаңар,
    карта өлкөлөгү бардык катталган иш-чаралардын тизмесин көрсөтөт, өзүңүздүн иш-чараны
    ошол жерден таап алсаңыз болот. Андан сырткары, миңдеген кишилер Код саатына катталышкандыктан,
    картанын жана иш-чаралардын тизмеси адатта 48 саатта бир жаңыртылат. Бир нече
    күндөн кийин кайра текшерип көргүлө!
  hoc_faq_map_a_markdown: We're so sorry you aren't seeing your event on the Hour
    of Code map. Because of the tens of thousands of organizers who sign up, the map
    aggregates the data and displays one point for several events. If you click the
    [events page](%{events_url}) link below the map you will be directed to a list
    of all events by state and can find your event listed there. Additionally, given
    the thousands of people signing up for the Hour of Code, the map and event list

  hoc_faq_count_hoc_a: Код саатынын санагычы колдонуучуларды так эсептеген курал эмес.
    Код саатынын катышуучуларын эсептеп жатканда, окуучулардын уникалдуу IDсин эсептебейбиз,
    анткени алардан катталуу же эсебине кирүү талап кылынбайт. Натыйжасында, иш жүзүндө
    катышуучулардын саны азыраак же көбүрөөк дагы болушу мүмкүн. Кенен маалыматты
    <a href='%{codeorg_url}/loc'>бул жерден</a> окуңуз.
  hoc_faq_count_hoc_a_markdown: 'We do not count unique student IDs perfectly when
    tracking participation in the Hour of Code. Why? Partly because we don''t want
    the friction of prompting to “login / register” before a student or classroom
    tries learning for the first time, and partly because there are may activities
    we cannot track online. We do take certain steps to reduce double-counting, but
    without a login prompt, this can''t work perfectly. At the same time, there are
    MANY student activities in the Hour of Code that aren''t tracked at all. For example:
    (1) students who use a mobile/tablet app to try the Hour of Code are typically
    not counted (2) students who share a screen for pair-programming or group-programming
    may be counted as one (3) students trying an unplugged classroom activity cannot
    be counted online (4) teachers who create their own Hour of Code activities. As
    a result, there is some under-counting and some double-counting, and so we do
    not view the Hour of Code tracker to be an exact measure of usage. It is certainly
    directionally correct, and shows that many tens of millions of students have participated.'
  hoc_faq_one_hour_q: Бир саатта бир киши канча үйрөнө алат?
  hoc_faq_one_hour_a: Код саатынын максаты - бир саат ичинде кишинин компүтердин адиси
    кылып чыгаруу эмес. Бир саат, компүтердик илим жашына, билимине карабастан бардык
    окуучулар өздөштүрө ала турган, чыгармачылыктуу жана көңүлдүү иш экенин көрсөткөнгө
    жетиштүү. Бул өнөкөштүктүн ийгилик өлчөмү канча окуучу компүтердик илимди үйрөнгөнүндө
    эмес - ийгилик жыныстык, этностук жана социалдык-экономикалык топтордун бул  ишке
    кеңири тартылышында жана бардык класстар үчүн компүтердик сабак өтүлүп башталышында.
    Миллиондогон окуучулар жана мугалимдер бир саат менен чектелбестен, бир күн же
    апта, андан дагы көбүрөөк убакыт үйрөнүүнү чечип, натыйжасында бүт курсту өтүшкөн.  <br/><br/>Окуучулардан
    башка дагы бир "үйрөнүүчүлөр" - эл агартуучулар, бир сааттык курстан кийин компүтердик
    билим боюнча коллежден алган даражасы жоктугуна карабастан, өздөрүнүн жөндөмүнө
    ишене алышкан. Он миңдеген мугалимдер компүтердик илимди андан ары өздөштүрүүнү
    чечишкен, докторантурага өтүп же онлайн курстарды сунуштап, же экөөнү тең бир
    алып кетишкен. Окуучулары компүтердик билимди өздөштүрүүнү каалаганын, ал эми
    мугалимдери аны үйрөтө ала тургандыгын түшүнгөн мектеп администрацияларына дагы
    айтсак болот.<br/><br/>  Эң негизгиси, бардык катышуучуларыбыз ушунун баарын кылса
    болоорун түшүнүшкөнүндө.
  hoc_faq_one_hour_a_markdown: |-
    The goal of the Hour of Code is not to teach anybody to become an expert computer scientist in one hour. One hour is only enough to learn that computer science is fun and creative, that it is accessible at all ages, for all students, regardless of background. The measure of success of this campaign is not in how much CS students learn - the success is reflected in broad participation across gender, racial/ethnic, and socioeconomic groups, and the resulting increase in enrollment and participation we see in CS courses at all grade levels. Millions of the participating teachers and students have decided to go beyond one hour -  to learn for a whole day or a whole week or longer, and many students have decided to enroll in a whole course (or even a college major) as a result.

    Besides the students, another "learner" is the educator who gains the confidence after one hour that they can teach computer science even though they may not have a college degree as a computer scientist. Tens of thousands of teachers decide to pursue computer science further, either attending PD or offering follow-on online courses, or both. And this applies to school administrators too, who realize that computer science is something their students want and their teachers are capable of.

    Above all, what all participants can learn in an hour is that we can do this.

  engineering_hero_heading: Join our engineering team!
  engineering_hero_desc: As we continue to expand our engineering team, we wanted
    to share more about our engineering organization at Code.org and some of the unique
    aspects of working here. If you are interested in applying for one of our roles,
    we'd love to hear from you!
  engineering_team_title: Meet the engineering team at Code.org
  engineering_team_card_text_1: This is (most of) us at our in-person get together
    during the summer of 2023! This crowd is divided into four sub-teams within our
    engineering team who work together to build and serve the platform for all our
    students and teachers.
  engineering_team_card_text_2: If you are interested in applying for one of our roles,
    we'd love to hear from you! You can find a list of open positions on our Careers
    page.
  engineering_our_team_title: Our engineering team
  engineering_our_team_desc: 'The engineering team at Code.org is divided into four
    sub-teams that build and support different areas of our platform:'
  engineering_our_team_sub_title_1: Student Learning Team
  engineering_our_team_text_1: Our Student Learning Team owns all our activities (we
    call them labs) that our students use each day. This team works mostly on front-end
    tech (we use React and a lot of custom JS) and we have a great working relationship
    with many partners and open source projects. For example, we use [Google's Blockly](%{youtube_url})
    for all of our block-based programming. We support students in their learning
    journey all the way from Kindergarten through 12th grade.
  engineering_our_team_sub_title_2: Teacher Experience Team
  engineering_our_team_text_2: Our Teacher Experience Team builds the tools that attract
    new teachers to Code.org (we call these acquisition products) and develops the
    platform that empowers our existing teachers to teach our curriculum (our teacher
    tools). As with our student tools, we rely on React to build our front-end and
    our server-side components are served using Ruby on Rails.
  engineering_our_team_sub_title_3: Platform Team
  engineering_our_team_text_3: Our Platform Team owns core components that serve the
    needs of our student and teacher teams (for example, authentication and user profile)
    and also has the mission of reaching students who we can't yet reach. This includes
    building integrations that connect us with schools that use different Learning
    Management Systems (LMS) and packaging our curriculum so that it can be used in
    remote schools who don't have access to reliable internet.
  engineering_our_team_sub_title_4: Infrastructure Team
  engineering_our_team_text_4: Our Infrastructure Team provides the backbone for the
    platform that supports our students and teachers. This includes our hosting infrastructure
    and related services (we use AWS), data management, security programs, developer
    and deployment services and much more. This team also owns our scaling and provisioning
    systems, which are critical during Hour of Code, where we invite every student
    in the world to complete an hour of coding with us.
  engineering_faq_question_1: What does Code.org do?
  engineering_faq_answer_1_a: Code.org is an education innovation nonprofit dedicated
    to the vision that every student in every school has the opportunity to learn
    computer science as part of their core K-12 education.
  engineering_faq_answer_1_b: We expand access to computer science in schools, with
    a focus on increasing participation by young women and students from other underrepresented
    groups. The leading provider of K-12 computer science curriculum in the largest
    school districts in the United States, Code.org also organizes the annual Hour
    of Code campaign, which has engaged more than 15% of all students in the world.
  engineering_faq_answer_1_c: Code.org is supported by generous donors including Microsoft,
    Amazon, Google and many others.
  engineering_faq_question_2: What is Code.org’s developer experience and tooling?
  engineering_faq_answer_2: Our developer experience may be different to what you’ve
    seen in your past roles. Working closely with our product team, we ship to production
    every weekday and we have a variety of cadences - sometimes you are writing code
    that goes live that day; other times you are on longer term projects - and while
    we do follow 2-weekly sprints, we do so in a lightweight way. We index towards
    getting the right things done the right way vs. taking a purist view of any particular
    methodology. [All our code](%{code_url}) is open source and we use JIRA and GitHub
    pull requests to track all of our work items. We also care a lot about quality
    and testing and are fortunate to have incredible support from [SauceLabs](%{saucelabs_url}),
    who help us run our suite of UI tests on various student devices (e.g., iPads)
    in their cloud device farm.
  engineering_faq_question_3: What is the engineer on-call rotation at Code.org?
  engineering_faq_answer_3: Our 30+ engineering team shares on-call responsibilities.
    Each engineer covers a 24-hour shift and uses our escalation paths and playbooks
    to respond to site outages or other live-site issues. We are proud of our site’s
    reliability - on average, each engineer is only woken up once per year for issues
    that are typically quick to resolve. Instead, the "Developer of the Day" usually
    spends a portion of their workday managing the production deployment and triaging
    less urgent issues.
  engineering_faq_question_4: Are you a remote-friendly / WFH organization?
  engineering_faq_answer_4_a: Yes! In 2019, shortly before the pandemic, Code.org
    became a remote-first organization. Today, we have engineers in every US time
    zone and accommodate working hours accordingly. Most of our meetings happen between
    the hours of 10am and 3pm PT.
  engineering_faq_answer_4_b: We also recognize the value of in-person time, and every
    quarter we get together in person, typically in Seattle. Two of these events (we
    call them Kick-off week and “Codechella”) bring everyone in the organization together
    in January and June - and the engineering and product teams meet separately in
    April and October.
  engineering_faq_answer_4_c: We strongly believe in spending time with our students
    and teachers, so many of these in-person events include trips into schools and
    classrooms to gather feedback or play-test our products
  engineering_faq_question_5: What makes the engineering team at Code.org unique?
  engineering_faq_answer_5_a: 'Beyond solving challenging technical problems, we have
    a few things that make our engineering org different from others you may have
    worked in:'
  engineering_faq_answer_5_b_1: We all share our passion for our mission.
  engineering_faq_answer_5_b_2: Each of us is here to support the mission to expand
    access to computer science for every student across the world. We all have our
    unique story and perspective about what drives us towards this mission.
  engineering_faq_answer_5_c_1: We care deeply about each other.
  engineering_faq_answer_5_c_2: When engineers are struggling with an issue, we step
    in and we help. One of our principles is that we are hard on problems, but kind
    to each other. We promote engineers regularly, but we don't prescribe over-engineered
    solutions just to support someone's promotion path. Instead, we invest in our
    engineers with a generous professional development budget and access to other
    learning opportunities.
  engineering_faq_answer_5_d_1: We work hard, but we set clear boundaries.
  engineering_faq_answer_5_d_2: While we support students across the world, we hold
    ourselves accountable for clear boundaries between work and home life. We enjoy
    no-meetings Wednesdays, taking our PTO (5 weeks total, which includes an org-wide
    2-week office closure at the end of the year aka Winter Break), half working day
    on Fridays during the summer aka Summer Fridays, and other generous benefits.
