## نظرة عامة على الدرس

Debugging is an essential element of learning to program. In this lesson, students will encounter puzzles that have been solved incorrectly. They will need to step through the existing code to identify errors, including missing blocks, extra blocks, and misordered blocks.

## Lesson Objectives

### Students will:

  * Predict where a program will fail
  * Modify an existing program to solve errors
  * Identify an algorithm that is unsuccessful when the steps are out of order

## Getting Started

### <a name="GetStarted"></a> Introduction

Ask students about problems they solve in everyday life.

  * How do you fix something that isn't working?
  * Do you follow a specific series of steps?
  * The puzzles in this unit have already been solved for you (yay!), but they don't seem to be working (boo!)
  * We call the problems in these programs "bugs," and it will be your job to "debug" them.

## Activity

### <a name="Activity"></a> [Maze: Debugging](http://learn.code.org/s/course1/stage/5/puzzle/1)

As your students work through the puzzles, observe how they search for bugs. Identify different strategies used and ask students to share with the whole class. This helps students to recognize that there are many ways to approach these problems.

## Extended Learning

<a name="Extended"></a>Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### Planting bugs

Have students go back through previous levels, purposefully adding bugs to their solutions. They can then ask other students to debug their work. This can also be done with paper puzzles.

### Common Core Math Standards

  * K.CC.B.4 - Understand the relationship between numbers and quantities; connect counting to cardinality.
  * K.OA.A.3 - Decompose numbers less than or equal to 10 into pairs in more than one way, e.g., by using objects or drawings, and record each decomposition by a drawing or equation (e.g., 5 = 2 + 3 and 5 = 4 + 1).
  * K.OA.A.5 - Fluently add and subtract within 5.
  * 1.OA.A.1 - Use addition and subtraction within 20 to solve word problems involving situations of adding to, taking from, putting together, taking apart, and comparing, with unknowns in all positions, e.g., by using objects, drawings, and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem.
  * 2.OA.A.1 - Use addition and subtraction within 100 to solve one- and two-step word problems involving situations of adding to, taking from, putting together, taking apart, and comparing, with unknowns in all positions, e.g., by using drawings and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem.
