          Hi, my name is Saloni. I use computer science to help solve problems in health and medicine. Let's learn about the "if else" block. It looks like the "if" block, but it has an extra part at the end that says "else".

          If I put a "move forward" block in the spot where it says "do" and a "turn left" block where it says "else" that means that the zombie will choose between 2 options. IF there is a path ahead, the zombie will move forward, and OTHERWISE (there isn't a path ahead), the zombie will turn left.

          Just like the "if" block, we can put "if else" blocks inside a "repeat" blocks so that the zombie keeps moving and the "if else" block will keep checking if there's somewhere to turn.

          This block looks the same as the "if" block, but there's an extra part at the bottom that says "else". If I put a "move forward" block where it says "do" and a "turn left" block where it says "else", that means Scrat the squirrel will move forward if there's a path ahead. If there's not a path ahead, Scrat will turn left.

          It's making a decision and doing one of the two actions based on that decision. And just like "if" blocks, you can put "if-else" blocks inside "repeat" blocks.

          In this example your goal is going to be to move the bird to get the pig.  Now we're gonna be able to use the "repeat" block in order to be able to do this very easily. You can either do this by giving the computer a "move forward" command five times in order to advance the bird one step each time to the pig.

So in order to do this you drag your "move forward" command, and then you put it inside the "repeat" block.And you can click on it and tell it how many times you want to repeat the block to tell it how many steps you want it to take forward.'

          Now one more thing is you can put as many commands as you want inside the "repeat" block. So in this example you're telling it to move forward and turn left, which it will do five times. All right good job and have fun!
