### Make a splash with your Hour of Code event and invite local media to see why computer science is important at your school.

*za sve upite medija i tiska kontaktirajte nas na <press@code.org>*

* * *

## Ključni Savjeti

- Obratite se medijima dva tjedna prije vašega događaja putem e-pošte. Ukoliko ne dobijete odgovor, propratite daljnjom e-poštom ili pak telefonskim razgovorom.
- Zamolite nekoga od školskog osoblja ili volontera da uslika događaj i podijeli slike na mreži ili ih pošalje novinama.
- Pišite o Satu Kodiranja na svojoj web stranici i u školskim novinama. Objavite detalje svog događaja i slike aktivnosti učenika.
- On Facebook and Twitter, share updates on your plans, announce your events, and post pictures during {{ campaign_date/year }}. Use the hashtag **#HourOfCode** so Code.org can see and promote your events.

## Step-by-step guide

### 1, Ispalnirajte svoj događaj

- Planirajte sastanak kako bi označili početak Sata Kodiranja.
- Send [a letter]({{ promote/sample_emails }}) to parents and ask them to spread the word.
- Send [a letter]({{ promote/sample_emails }}) to invite your local mayor, member of Congress, governor, or influential businessperson to attend and speak to your students.
- Organizirajte grupne aktivnosti (kao na primjer prikazivanje aktivnosti programiranja bez elektronskih uređaja) ili pokažite aktivnosti koje su izvršili i vodili učenici.
- Show Code.org’s [Hour of Code video]({{ urls/home }}) or one of [these videos]({{ promote/videos }}) to inspire students. <br />

### 2. Identify specific reporters that cover education or local events

Like local newspapers, TV station or radio stations, or blogs. <br />

### 3. Kontaktirajte mjesne medije

Najbolji način kontakta je putem elektroničke pošte. It should be short and should communicate "why should other people care about this event"? Uključite kontakt informacije (također i broj mobitela) osoba koje će biti prisutne tijekom događaja. **[See a sample pitch to media]({{ promote/press-kit-emails }})**.

Pretražite internet da biste našli kontakt informacije. If you can't find it, call the publication to ask, or email the organization's general email address and ask for your message to be directed to the correct reporter. <br />

### 4. Pripremite se odgovoriti na pitanja o vašim školskim aktivnostima u vezi događaja. Na primjer:

#### Zašto vaša škola sudjeluje u Satu Kodiranja?

Dok većina nas shvaća koliko je za učenike važno naučiti se snalaziti u današnjem tehnološki orjentiranom svijetu, mnogi učitelji nemaju iskustva sa informatikom i ne znaju gdje započeti. Ovaj je događaj prilika za sve da vide što je informatika zapravo.

Nadamo se da će nadahnuti učenike da nastave učiti. Research also shows that kids can pick up programming concepts before they know how to read and write. U stvari, njihov mozak je otvoreniji učenju računalnih jezika u tom ranom dobu, baš kao i učenju stranih jezika. <br /> <br />

#### Zašto je to važno?

Technology is transforming every industry on the planet. In 2015, 7 million openings in the U.S. were in occupations—including art and design—that value coding skills. But 60 percent of schools in the U.S. don't teach computer science. It’s time for us to catch up to the 21st-century. We know that regardless of what our students do when they grow up, whether they go into medicine, business, politics, or the arts, knowing how to build technology will give them confidence and a competitive edge. <br />

## Sample email to send to invite local media to your event

**Subject line**: Local school joins mission to introduce students to computer science

Computers are everywhere, changing every industry on the planet, but fewer than half of all schools teach computer science. Young women and students from marginalized racial and ethnic groups are severely underrepresented in computer science classes, and in the tech industry. Dobra je vijest da ste vi na putu to promijeniti.

With the Hour of Code, computer science has been on homepages of Google, MSN, Yahoo!, and Disney. Over 100 partners have joined together to support this movement. Every Apple Store in the world has hosted an Hour of Code. Even President Obama wrote his first line of code as part of the campaign.

That’s why every one of the [X number] students at [SCHOOL NAME] are joining in on the largest learning event in history: The Hour of Code, during Computer Science Education Week (December 3-9).

I'm writing to invite you to attend our kickoff assembly and to see kids start the activity on [DATE].

The Hour of Code, organized by the nonprofit Code.org and over 100 others, is a global movement that believes the students of today are ready to learn critical skills for 21st-century success. Please join us.

I look forward to being in touch. <br />

## Additional details and a quote you can use in materials

"The Hour of Code is designed to demystify code and show that computer science is not rocket science—anybody can learn the basics," said Hadi Partovi, founder and CEO of Code.org. "Over 100 million students worldwide have tried an Hour of Code. The demand for relevant 21st-century computer science education crosses all borders and knows no boundaries." <br /> <br />
