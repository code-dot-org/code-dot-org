# Kako poučavati Sat Kodiranja

Join the movement and introduce a group of students to their first hour of computer science with these steps:

## 1) Watch this how-to video <iframe width="500" height="255" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/SrnvvWDm73k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
## 2) Choose a tutorial for your hour:

We provide a variety of [fun, hour-long tutorials](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/learn') %) for students of all ages, created by a variety of partners.

**[Student-guided Hour of Code tutorials:](%= resolve_url("https://code.org/learn") %)**

  * Zahtijevaju minimalno vrijeme pripreme učitelja
  * Prigodni su za samostalno učenje - dozvoljavajući učenicima da rade vlastitim tempom i na svojoj razini

**[Teacher-guided Hour of Code tutorials:](%= resolve_url("https://code.org/educate/teacher-led") %)**

  * Are lesson plans that require some advance teacher preparation
  * Are categorized by grade level *and* by subject area (eg Math, English, etc)

## 3) Promote your Hour of Code

Promote your Hour of Code [with these tools](%= resolve_url('/promote') %) and encourage others to host their own events.

## 4) Plan your technology needs - computers are optional

The best Hour of Code experience includes Internet-connected computers. But you **don’t** need a computer for every child, and you can even do the Hour of Code without a computer at all.

**Plan Ahead!** Do the following before your event starts:

  * Test tutorials on student computers or devices. Make sure they work properly on browsers with sound and video.
  * Provide headphones for your class, or ask students to bring their own, if the tutorial you choose works best with sound.
  * **Don't have enough devices?** Use [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q). Kada učenici rade sa suradnikom, oni pomažu jedan drugome i manje se oslanjaju na učitelja. Tako će uvidjeti da je informatika druževna i dobra za suradnju.
  * **Niska propusnost?** Planirajte prikaz video zapisa u prednjem dijelu učionice, tako da svaki učenik ne mora preuzimati vlastitu kopiju video zapisa. Možete isprobati i vodiče koji ne zahtijevaju upotrebu računala i/ili interneta.

## 5) Start your Hour of Code off with an inspiring speaker or video

**Invite a [local volunteer](https://code.org/volunteer/local) to inspire your students by talking about the breadth of possibilities in computer science.** There are thousands of volunteers around the world ready to help with your Hour of Code. [Use this map](https://code.org/volunteer/local) to find local volunteers who can visit your classroom or join a video chat with your students.

[![](/images/fit-300/volunteer-map.png)](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/volunteer/local') %)

**Show an inspirational video:**

  * Originalni video zapis kada je Code.org pokrenut, u kome su Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg i zvijezda NBA-a Chris Bosh (Možete izabrati verzije u trajanju od [1 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYZF6oIZtfc), [5 minuta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc) i [9 minuta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1xS07N-FA))
  * The [Hour of Code 2013 launch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC5FbmsH4fw), or the <% if @country == 'uk' %> [Hour of Code 2015 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L97YMYqLHc) <% else %> [Hour of Code 2015 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L97YMYqLHc) <% end %>
  * [Predsjednik Obama poziva sve učenike da nauče informatiku](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvmhE1J9PY)
  * Find more inspirational videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNfpD8i4Sx7U0y2MccnrNZuP).

**It’s okay if both you and your students are brand new to computer science. Here are some ideas to introduce your Hour of Code activity:**

  * Explain ways that technology impacts our lives, with examples both boys and girls will care about (Talk about saving lives, helping people, connecting people, etc.).
  * As a class, list things that use code in everyday life.
  * See tips for getting girls interested in computer science [here](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/girls') %).

**Want more teaching ideas?** Check out [best practices](http://www.slideshare.net/TeachCode/hour-of-code-best-practices-for-successful-educators-51273466) from experienced educators.

## 6) Code!

**Direct students to the activity**

  * Write the tutorial link on a whiteboard. Find the link listed on the [information for your selected tutorial](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/learn') %) under the number of participants.

**When your students come across difficulties it's okay to respond:**

  * “I don’t know. Let’s figure this out together.”
  * “Technology doesn’t always work out the way we want.”
  * “Learning to program is like learning a new language; you won’t be fluent right away.”

**[Check out these teaching tips](http://www.code.org/files/CSTT_IntroducingCS.PDF)**

**What to do if a student finishes early?**

  * Students can see all tutorials and try another Hour of Code activity at [<%= resolve_url('code.org/learn') %>](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/learn') %)
  * Ili zamolite učenike koji završe ranije da pomognu svojim kolegama koji imaju poteškoća s aktivnostima.

## Što poslije Sata Kodiranja?

The Hour of Code is just the first step on a journey to learn more about how technology works and how to create software applications. To continue this journey:

  * Encourage students to continue to [learn online](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/learn/beyond') %).
  * [Attend](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/professional-development-workshops') %) a 1-day, in-person workshop to receive instruction from an experienced computer science facilitator. (US educators only)
