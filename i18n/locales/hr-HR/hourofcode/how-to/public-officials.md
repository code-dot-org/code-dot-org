## Neka svaka škola sudjeluje, a svaki student uči!

1. **Read our one-pager** on why computer science education is important, and how you can help the effort by supporting the Hour of Code. [Get the one-pager here.](/files/hoc-one-pager.pdf)

2. **Recruit local schools and districts.** Use [this email](%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#sample-emails') %) or [this blurb](%= resolve_url('/promote/stats') %) as a starting point, and take a look at this [how-to](%= resolve_url('/how-to') %) for schools and districts.

3. **Host an Hour of Code event.** See our [event how-to guide](%= resolve_url('/how-to/events') %) for a sample run of show, media outreach kit and other event-planning resources. Hosting an event is a great way to promote the Hour of Code and increase participation.

4. **Attend an event during Computer Science Education Week (<%= campaign_date('short') %>).** [Find classrooms and schools](%= resolve_url('/events') %) participating in your district, city or state.

5. **Issue a proclamation or resolution.** See this [sample resolution](%= resolve_url('resources/proclamation') %) supportive of Computer Science Education Week and its goals that could be used by state and local legislators.

6. **Draft an op-ed**. Consider publishing an opinion piece in your local paper. See this [sample op-ed](%= resolve_url('/promote/op-ed') %) supporting comupter supportive of Computer Science Education Week and its goals.

7. **Spread the word.** [Share the Hour of Code video on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fhourofcode.com%2Fus) and [talk about your support on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhourofcode.com&text=I%27m%20participating%20in%20this%20year%27s%20%23HourOfCode%2C%20are%20you%3F%20%40codeorg&original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fq%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Ftwitter.com%252Fshare%253Fhashtags%253D%2526amp%253Brelated%253Dcodeorg%2526amp%253Btext%253DI%252527m%252Bparticipating%252Bin%252Bthis%252Byear%252527s%252B%252523HourOfCode%25252C%252Bare%252Byou%25253F%252B%252540codeorg%2526amp%253Burl%253Dhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fhourofcode.com%26sa%3DD%26sntz%3D1%26usg%3DAFQjCNE1GLTUbKZfMlEh9Aj5w0iswz6PYQ&related=codeorg&hashtags=). Share pictures of events or a video of you and other adults doing the Hour of Code. Use the hashtag **#HourOfCode** so Code.org (@code.org) can see it and promote the support. Or, use these sample tweets:
    
    - Every student, boy or girl, should have the chance to learn computer science. Join us in starting with one #HourOfCode [https://hourofcode.com](%= resolve_url('/') %)
    - Today, we're proud to join the Hour of Code movement. Are you in? #HourOfCode [https://hourofcode.com](%= resolve_url('/') %)   
          
        

8. **Issue a press release.** [Use this sample](%= resolve_url('/promote/official-press-release') %) as a guide.

9. **Connect locally.** Visit [code.org/promote](%= codeorg_url('/promote') %) to learn more about computer science education in your state. Sign the petition there and you’ll get updates from Code.org on their local, state and federal advocacy efforts.
