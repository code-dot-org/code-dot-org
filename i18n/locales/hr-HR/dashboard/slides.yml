        text: 'Ako želiš da ptica MAHNE kad KLIKNEŠ mišem, možeš to ostvariti tako se prikačiš blok "MAHNI" na odgovarajući upravitelj događajima. Tada će u tvojoj igri kad god klikneš mišem ptica mahnuti krilima.'

We can take that function and give it a name, draw a square, so that any time we want to do that, we simply say draw a square and it will go back and invoke that function, that code. It will get done for us. We've added that concept to our programming language."

Once you've learned these really basic moves, you learn new moves and put together these building blocks, like a pick and roll or give and go. You can then go from there to do more complex plays. Once you learn that play and give it a name, everybody on the team knows how to do it."

After the programmer is sure the steps are correct, it's time to translate the algorithm into a program with language that the computer can understand."

Most people have a lot of contacts, you might have say, 1000 contacts and we don't want to send all of those contacts at once to your phone because it's too large of a message. Similar to the way the internet breaks large messages down into packets, we use a concept called paging where we might only send your phone 100 contacts at a time and let your phone respond to us and ask for the next 100."
