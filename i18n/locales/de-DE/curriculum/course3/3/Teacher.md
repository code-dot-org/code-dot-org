## Lesson Objectives

### Students will:

  * Count the number of times an action should be repeated and represent it as a loop
  * Divide the number of degrees in a circle into even segments
  * Calculate the angles in equilateral and 30 60 90 triangles
  * Given a perimeter and one side of a rectangle, calculate the remaining sides
  * Identify symmetrical shapes
  * Decompose a shape into its smallest repeatable sequence

## Getting Started

### <a name="GetStarted"></a> Introduction

Review with students the basic maze navigation, particularly:

  * Moving vs Jumping
  * Turning by degrees
  * Looping

## Activity

### <a name="Activity"></a> [Artist](http://learn.code.org/s/course3/stage/3/puzzle/1)

In the Artist levels students are not constrained to 90 degree angles. Having protractors available can be help students better visualize the angles they need.

## Extended Learning

<a name="Extended"></a>Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### The Copy Machine

  * Give students two pieces of paper
  * On one sheet have the students draw a simple image
  * On the second sheet draw instructions for recreating that image commands to move straight and turn at various angles.
  * Trade instruction sheets and attempt to recreate the image using only the provided instructions.

### CSTA K-12 Computer Science Standards

  * CT.L1:3-01. Use technology resources (e.g., puzzles, logical thinking programs) to solve age appropriate problems.
  * CL.L1:3-02. Work cooperatively and collaboratively with peers teachers, and others using technology.
  * CPP.L1:6-05. Construct a program as a set of step-by-step instructions to be acted out.

### Next-Gen Science Standards

  * 3-5-ETS1-2. Generate and compare multiple possible solutions to a problem based on how well each is likely to meet the criteria and constraints of the problem.

### Common Core Mathematical Practices

  *   1. Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.
  *   1. Reason abstractly and quantitatively.
  *   1. Model with mathematics
  *   1. Use appropriate tools strategically.
  *   1. Attend to precision.
  *   1. Look for and make use of structure.
  *   1. Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.

### Common Core Math Standards

  * 3.OA.3 - Use multiplication and division within 100 to solve word problems in situations involving equal groups, arrays, and measurement quantities.
  * 3.G.A.2 - Partition shapes into parts with equal areas. Express the area of each part as a unit fraction of the whole.
  * 4.NBT.B.4 - Fluently add and subtract multi-digit whole numbers using the standard algorithm.
  * 4.MD.A.3 - Apply the area and perimeter formulas for rectangles in real world and mathematical problems.
  * 4.MD.C.5 - Recognize angles as geometric shapes that are formed wherever two rays share a common endpoint, and understand concepts of angle measurement.
  * 4.MD.C.7 - Recognize angle measure as additive.
  * 4.G.A.1 - Draw points, lines, line segments, rays, angles (right, acute, obtuse), and perpendicular and parallel lines.
  * 4.G.A.2 - Classify two-dimensional figures based on the presence or absence of parallel or perpendicular lines, or the presence or absence of angles of a specified size.
  * 4.G.A.3 -Recognize a line of symmetry for a two-dimensional figure as a line across the figure such that the figure can be folded along the line into matching part.
  * 5.NBT.B.5 - Fluently multiply multi-digit whole numbers using the standard algorithm.
  * 5.G.A.2 - Represent real world and mathematical problems by graphing points in the first quadrant of the coordinate plane, and interpret coordinate values of points in the context of the situation.

### Common Core Language Arts Standards

  * L.3.6 - Acquire and use accurately grade-appropriate conversational, general academic, and domain-specific words and phrases, including those that signal spatial and temporal relationships.
  * L.4.6 - Acquire and use accurately grade-appropriate general academic and domain-specific words and phrases, including those that signal precise actions, emotions, or states of being and that are basic to a particular topic.
  * L.5.6 - Acquire and use accurately grade-appropriate general academic and domain-specific words and phrases, including those that signal contrast, addition, and other logical relationships
