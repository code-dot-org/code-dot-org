# Kontakt zu internationalen Partnern

Code.org works with many organizations around the world to make the Hour of Code a truly international movement. Did you know that in 2017, 60% of all Hour of Code events occurred outside of the U.S.?

You, too, can play a leading role to get more people in your country involved! If you're in one of the countries below, reach out to the listed partner and get connected with your local Hour of Code.
