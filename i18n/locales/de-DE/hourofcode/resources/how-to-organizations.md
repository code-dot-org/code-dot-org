# Bring the Hour of Code to your company

## 1) Try the tutorials:

We’ll host a variety of fun, hour-long tutorials, created by a variety of partners. New tutorials are coming to kick off the Hour of Code before December 7-13.

**All Hour of Code tutorials:**

  * Require minimal prep-time for organizers
  * Are self-guided - allowing students to work at their own pace and skill-level

## 2) Plan your hardware needs - computers are optional

The best Hour of Code experience will be with Internet-connected computers. But you don’t need a computer for every participant, and can even do the Hour of Code without a computer at all.

  * **Test tutorials on student computers or devices.** Make sure they work properly (with sound and video).
  * **Preview the congrats page** to see what students will see when they finish. 
  * **Provide headphones for your group**, or ask students to bring their own, if the tutorial you choose works best with sound.

## 3) Plan ahead based on your technology available

  * **Don't have enough devices?** Use [pair programming](http://www.ncwit.org/resources/pair-programming-box-power-collaborative-learning). When participants partner up, they help each other and rely less on the teacher.
  * **Have low bandwidth?** Plan to show videos at the front of the class, so each student isn't downloading their own videos. Or try the unplugged / offline tutorials.

## 4) Inspire students - show them a video

Show students an inspirational video to kick off the Hour of Code. Examples:

  * Das Original-Launch-Video von Code.org Start video, mit Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg und NBA-Star Chris Bosh (es stehen mehrere Versionen zur Verfügung: [1 Minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYZF6oIZtfc), [5 Minuten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc) und [9 Minuten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1xS07N-FA))
  * The [Hour of Code 2013 launch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC5FbmsH4fw), or the <% if @country == 'uk' %> [Hour of Code 2014 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96B5-JGA9EQ) <% else %> [Hour of Code 2014 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7AjDMz_dc&index=2&list=PLzdnOPI1iJNe1WmdkMG-Ca8cLQpdEAL7Q) <% end %>
  * [President Obama calling on all students to learn computer science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvmhE1J9PY)
