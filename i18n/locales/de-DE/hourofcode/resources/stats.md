### Bring computer science to your school. Start with an Hour of Code

Computer sind überall, aber weniger Schulen unterrichten Informatik als vor 10 Jahren. Good news is, we’re on our way to change this. If you heard about the [Hour of Code](<%= hoc_uri('/') %>) last year, you might know it made history. In one week, 15 million students tried computer science! The [Hour of Code](<%= hoc_uri('/') %>) is a one-hour introduction to computer science, designed to demystify code and show that anybody can learn the basics. [Sign up](<%= hoc_uri('/') %>) to host an Hour of Code this December 8-14 during Computer Science Education Week and help reach 100 million students by the end of the year. Add your school to the map, go to <http://hourofcode.com>
