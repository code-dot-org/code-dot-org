## Activity

### <a name="Activity"></a> [Spelling Bee](http://learn.code.org/s/course1/stage/11/puzzle/1)

Very young students or struggling readers may need aditional support finding the words - using manipulatives (like Scrabble tiles) can help students see what words look like in different directions.

## Extended Learning

<a name="Extended"></a>Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### Vocab Hop Scotch

Using class vocab words, create a floor-sized word search. The whole class can then "program" a student, or teacher, to spell out words by creating sequences of cardinal directions.
