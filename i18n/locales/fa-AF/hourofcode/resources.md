## Send these emails to help promote the Hour of Code

<a id="email"></a>

## Ask your school, employer or friends to sign up:

کمپیوتر ها همه جا هستند، اما مدارس کمتر علوم کامپیوتر را در 10 سال گذشته تدریس کرده اند. Good news is, we’re on our way to change this. If you've heard about the Hour of Code before, you might know it made history. More than 100 million students have tried an Hour of Code.

With the Hour of Code, computer science has been on homepages of Google, MSN, Yahoo! and Disney. Over 100 partners joined together to support this movement. Last year, every Apple Store in the world hosted an Hour of Code and even President Obama wrote his first line of code as part of the campaign.

This year, let's make it even bigger. I’m asking you to join in for the Hour of Code 2015. Please get involved with an Hour of Code event during Computer Science Education Week, <%= campaign_date('full') %>.

Get the word out. Host an event. Ask a local school to sign up. Or try the Hour of Code yourself -- everyone can benefit from learning the basics.

Get started at http://hourofcode.com/<%= @country %>

## Invite media to attend your event:

**Subject line:** Local school joins mission to introduce students to computer science

Computers are everywhere, but fewer schools teach computer science than 10 years ago. Girls and minorities are severely underrepresented. Good news is, we’re on our way to change this.

With the Hour of Code, computer science has been on homepages of Google, MSN, Yahoo! and Disney. Over 100 partners joined together to support this movement. Last year, every Apple Store in the world hosted an Hour of Code and even President Obama wrote his first line of code as part of the campaign.

That’s why every one of the [X number] students at [SCHOOL NAME] are joining in on the largest learning event in history: The Hour of Code, during Dec. 7-13.

I'm writing to invite you to attend our kickoff assembly, and to see kids start the activity on [DATE].

The Hour of Code, organized by the nonprofit Code.org and over 100 others, is a statement that today’s generation of students are ready to learn critical skills for 21st century success. Please join us.

**Contact:** [YOUR NAME], [TITLE], cell: (212) 555-5555

**When:** [DATE and TIME of your event]

**Where:** [ADDRESS and DIRECTIONS]

I look forward to being in touch.

## Tell parents about your school's event:

Dear Parents,

We live in a world surrounded by technology. And we know that whatever field our students choose to go into as adults, their ability to succeed will increasingly hinge on understanding how technology works. But only a tiny fraction of us are learning computer science, and less students are studying it than a decade ago.

That’s why our entire school is joining in on the largest learning event in history: The Hour of Code, during Computer Science Education Week (Dec. 7-13). More than 100 million students worldwide have already tried an Hour of Code.

Our Hour of Code is a statement that [SCHOOL NAME] is ready to teach these foundational 21st century skills. To continue bringing programming activities to your students, we want to make our Hour of Code event huge. I encourage you to volunteer, reach out to local media, share the news on social media channels and consider hosting additional Hour of Code events in the community.

This is a chance to change the future of education in [TOWN/CITY NAME].

See http://hourofcode.com/<%= @country %> for details, and help spread the word.

Sincerely,

Your principal

<a id="politicians"></a>

## Invite a local politician to your school's event:

Dear [Mayor/Governor/Representative/Senator LAST NAME]:

Did you know that in today’s economy, computing jobs outnumber students graduating into the field by 3-to-1? And, computer science is foundational for *every* industry today. Yet most of schools don’t teach it. At [SCHOOL NAME], we are trying to change that.

That’s why our entire school is joining in on the largest learning event in history: The Hour of Code, during Computer Science Education Week (Dec. 7-13). More than 100 million students worldwide have already tried an Hour of Code.

I'm writing to invite you to take part in our Hour of Code event and speak at our kickoff assembly. It’ll take place on [DATE, TIME, PLACE], and will make a strong statement that [State or City name] is ready to teach our students critical 21st century skills. We want to ensure that our students are on the forefront of creating technology of the future--not just consuming it.

Please contact me at [PHONE NUMBER OR EMAIL ADDRESS]. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely, [NAME], [TITLE]
