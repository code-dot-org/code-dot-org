Check out our [how-to toolkit]({{ localized_files/elected_official }}) when hosting an elected official during an Hour of Code for more info.
- Invite media/press. i.e. local news station, newspaper, education/tech bloggers. See our [press kit]({{ promote/press_kit_url }}) for help.

## 2. During your event

- Kick off your event with one of our [inspirational videos]({{ promote/videos }}).
- Give an intro overviewing the importance of computer science, using these [stats and infographics]({{ promote/stats_url }}).   
      
    
- **Other event ideas**: 
    - Invite a local industry leader to discuss his or her work involving computer science.
    - Invite a local politician and have students teach him or her how to code.
    - Have a group of students demonstrate an unplugged activity.
    - Have a group of students teach the principal or a group of teachers how to code.
    - If your school already teaches computer science, have students demo projects.

## 3. Share how it went

Share pictures of your event on Facebook and Twitter and use the hashtag **#HourOfCode**.

## Host a Family Code Night with the Hour of Code and invite parents to participate

Consider hosting a K-5 evening event and invite parents to join their students for an hour of computer science. This is a great way to engage the larger community and encourage parent support for computer science at your school. Our partners at Family Code Night have created an all-in-one event kit with planning checklist, presenter’s script, invitation emails, posters, powerpoints, and more to run your own event.
