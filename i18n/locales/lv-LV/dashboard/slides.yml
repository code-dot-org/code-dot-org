But with just a few lines of code, I can have a system send an email to everyone on Facebook wishing them a happy birthday. So that's what loops are, and why they're valuable, and something that computers can do very well."

          In this example your goal is going to be to move the bird to get the pig.  Now we're gonna be able to use the "repeat" block in order to be able to do this very easily. You can either do this by giving the computer a "move forward" command five times in order to advance the bird one step each time to the pig.

So in order to do this you drag your "move forward" command, and then you put it inside the "repeat" block.And you can click on it and tell it how many times you want to repeat the block to tell it how many steps you want it to take forward.'

          Now one more thing is you can put as many commands as you want inside the "repeat" block. So in this example you're telling it to move forward and turn left, which it will do five times. All right good job and have fun!
