  oceans_behind_the_scenes_1: Levels 2-4 use a pretrained model provided by the <a
    href="https://www.tensorflow.org/" >TensorFlow</a> <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/slim/nets/mobilenet_v1.md">
    MobileNet </a> project. A MobileNet model is a <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/practica/image-classification/convolutional-neural-networks">convolutional
    neural network</a> that has been trained on <a href="http://www.image-net.org/">ImageNet</a>,
    a dataset of over 14 million images hand-annotated with words such as "balloon"
    or "strawberry". In order to customize this model with the labeled training data
    the student generates in this activity, we use a technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning">Transfer
    Learning</a>. Each image in the training dataset is fed to MobileNet, as pixels,
    to obtain a list of annotations that are most likely to apply to it. Then, for
    a new image, we feed it to MobileNet and compare its resulting list of annotations
    to those from the training dataset. We classify the new image with the same label
    (such as "fish" or "not fish") as the images from the training set with the most
    similar results.
  oceans_behind_the_scenes_1_markdown: Levels 2-4 use a pretrained model provided
    by the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) [MobileNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/slim/nets/mobilenet_v1.md)
    project. A MobileNet model is a [convolutional neural network](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/practica/image-classification/convolutional-neural-networks)
    that has been trained on [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/), a dataset of over
    14 million images hand-annotated with words such as "balloon" or "strawberry".
    In order to customize this model with the labeled training data the student generates
    in this activity, we use a technique called [Transfer Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning).

    as "fish" or "not fish") as the images from the training set with the most similar
    results.
  oceans_behind_the_scenes_2: Levels 6-8 use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine">Support-Vector
    Machine</a> (SVM). We look at each component of the fish (such as eyes, mouth,
    body) and assemble all of the metadata for the components (such as number of teeth,
    body shape) into a vector of numbers for each fish. We use these vectors to train
    the SVM. Based on the training data, the SVM separates the "space" of all possible
    fish into two parts, which correspond to the classes we are trying to learn (such
    as "blue" or "not blue").

  hoc_faq_title: Perguntas frequentes
  hoc_faq_what_is_hoc_q: O que é a Hora do Código?
  hoc_faq_what_is_hoc_a: A Hora do Código começou como uma introdução de uma hora
    à ciência da computação, criada para desmistificar a programação e mostrar que
    qualquer pessoa pode aprender os fundamentos básicos e ampliar a participação
    na área desta ciência. Desde então ela tornou-se um esforço global para celebrar
    a ciência da computação, começando com atividades de programação com 1 hora de
    duração, mas expandindo-se para todos os tipos de esforços de comunidade. Confira
    os <a href='%{tutorials}'>tutoriais e atividades</a>. Esta campanha popular é
    apoiada por mais de <a href='%{partners}'>400 parceiros</a> e 200 mil educadores
    no mundo todo.
  hoc_faq_what_is_hoc_a_markdown: The Hour of Code started as a one-hour introduction
    to computer science, designed to demystify "code", to show that anybody can learn
    the basics, and to broaden participation in the field of computer science. It
    has since become a worldwide effort to celebrate computer science, starting with
    1-hour coding activities but expanding to all sorts of community efforts. Check
    out the [tutorials and activities](%{tutorials}). This grassroots campaign is
    supported by over [400 partners](%{partners}) and 200,000 educators worldwide.
  hoc_faq_last_year: Experimente os tutoriais
  hoc_faq_when_is_hoc_q: Quando acontece a Hora do Código?
  hoc_faq_when_is_hoc_a: A Hora do Código é realizada todo ano durante a <a href='%{csedweek_url}'>Semana
    da Educação em Ciência da Computação</a>. A %{campaign_date_year} Semana da Educação
    em Ciência da Computação está com data marcada para %{campaign_date_full}, mas
    você pode organizar uma Hora do Código durante o ano inteiro. A Semana da Educação
    em Ciência da Computação é realizada anualmente, em reconhecimento ao aniversário
    da pioneira da computação, a <a href='%{grace_hopper}'>Almirante Grace Murray
    Hopper</a> (9 de dezembro de 1906).
  hoc_faq_when_is_hoc_a_markdown: The Hour of Code takes place each year during [Computer
    Science Education Week](%{csedweek_url}). The %{campaign_date_year} Computer Science
    Education Week will be %{campaign_date_full}, but you can host an Hour of Code
    all year-round. Computer Science Education Week is held annually in recognition
    of the birthday of computing pioneer [Admiral Grace Murray Hopper](%{grace_hopper})
    (December 9, 1906).
  hoc_faq_why_cs_q: Por que ciência da computação?
  hoc_faq_why_cs_a: "<i>Todo</i> aluno deveria ter a oportunidade de aprender ciência
    da computação, pois ela ajuda a desenvolver habilidades de resolução de problemas,
    lógica e criatividade. Começando cedo, os alunos terão uma base importante para
    serem bem-sucedidos em qualquer carreira do século XXI. Veja mais dados estatísticos
    <a href='%{stats_url}'>aqui</a>."
  hoc_faq_why_cs_a_markdown: _Every_ student should have the opportunity to learn
    computer science. It helps nurture problem-solving skills, logic and creativity.
    By starting early, students will have a foundation for success in any 21st-century
    career path. See more stats [here](%{stats_url}).
  hoc_faq_how_participate_q: Como participar da Hora do Código?
  hoc_faq_how_participate_a: "<a href='/how-to'>Comece a planejar aqui</a>, leia nosso
    guia prático. Você pode organizar um evento da Hora do Código na sua escola ou
    na sua comunidade &mdash; como em um clube de atividades extracurriculares, uma
    instituição sem fins lucrativos ou no trabalho. Ou, apenas experimente você mesmo
    quando %{campaign_date} chegar."
  hoc_faq_how_participate_a_markdown: "[Start planning here](%{howto}) by reviewing
    our how-to guide. You can organize an Hour of Code event at your school or in
    your community — like in an extracurricular club, non-profit or at work. Or, just
    try it yourself when %{campaign_date} arrives."
  hoc_faq_behind_hoc_q: De quem é a ideia da Hora do Código?
  hoc_faq_behind_hoc_a: A Hora do Código é gerenciada pelos <a href='%{partner_url}'>Comitês
    de Assessoria e Revisão</a> da Semana da Educação em Ciência da Computação e da
    Hora do Código, assim como por uma sem precedentes coalizão de parceiros que se
    uniu para apoiar a Hora do Código &mdash; dentre eles a Microsoft, Apple, Amazon,
    Boys and Girls Clubs of America e College Board.
  hoc_faq_behind_hoc_a_markdown: The Hour of Code is driven by the Hour of Code and
    Computer Science Education Week [Advisory and Review Committees](%{partner_url})
    as well as an unprecedented coalition of partners that have come together to support
    the Hour of Code — including Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Boys and Girls Clubs of
    America and the College Board.
  hoc_faq_host_q: Não sei nada sobre programação. Ainda assim posso sediar um evento?
  hoc_faq_host_a: Pode, sim! As atividades da Hora do Código são autoexplicativas.
    Tudo o que você precisa fazer é <a href='%{codeorg_url}/learn'>experimentar nossos
    tutoriais</a>, escolher um tutorial e uma hora &mdash; nós tomamos conta do resto.
    Também temos opções para diferentes idades e níveis de experiência - a partir
    do jardim de infância. Comece a planejar seu evento, leia nosso <a href='/how-to'>Guia
    prático</a>.
  hoc_faq_host_a_markdown: Of course. Hour of Code activities are self-guided. All
    you have to do is [try our current tutorials](%{codeorg_url}/learn), pick the
    tutorial you want, and pick an hour — we take care of the rest. We also have options
    for every age and experience-level, from kindergarten and up. Start planning your
    event by reading our [how to guide](%{howto}).
  hoc_faq_devices_q: Que dispositivos eu devo usar para meus alunos?
  hoc_faq_devices_a: Os tutoriais da Code.org funcionam em todos os dispositivos e
    navegadores. Você pode ver mais informações sobre os requisitos tecnológicos dos
    tutoriais da Code.org <a href='%{codeorg_url}/educate/it'>aqui</a>. Requisitos
    necessários para tutoriais que não são da Code.org podem ser encontrados em <a
    href='%{codeorg_url}/learn'>%{partner_url}/learn</a> na descrição específica do
    tutorial. Não se esqueça de que também temos  <a href='%{unplugged_url}'>atividades
    off-line</a>, caso sua escola não possa fornecer estrutura para os tutoriais on-line!
  hoc_faq_devices_a_markdown: Code.org tutorials work on all devices and browsers.
    You can see more information about Code.org's tutorial tech needs [here](%{codeorg_url}/educate/it).
    Tech needs for non-Code.org tutorials can be found on [%{partner_url}/learn](%{codeorg_url}/learn)
    in the tutorial specific description. Don't forget we also offer [unplugged activities](%{unplugged_url})
    if your school can't accommodate the tutorials!
  hoc_faq_need_computers_q: É necessário um computador para cada participante?
  hoc_faq_need_computers_a: Não. Temos tutoriais da Hora do Código que funcionam em
    computadores, smartphones, tablets e alguns que não exigem computador! Você pode
    participar independentemente de onde esteja e do que tenha. <p><i>Estas são algumas
    opções:</i> <br> <ul> <li><b>Trabalho em duplas.</b> <a href='%{pair_programming_research}'>Pesquisas
    mostram</a> que alunos aprendem mais <a href='%{pair_programming_video}'>programando
    em duplas</a>, compartilhando um computador e trabalhando juntos. Incentive seus
    alunos a trabalhar em duplas. <li><b>Use uma tela projetada.</b> Se você tem um
    projetor e uma tela para um computador conectado à Internet, toda a classe pode
    fazer a Hora do Código junta. Assistam aos vídeos juntos e se revezem para resolver
    desafios ou para responder a perguntas. <li><b>Atividades off-line.</b> Oferecemos
    <a href='%{unplugged_url}'>tutoriais que não precisam de computador</a> em momento
    algum. </ul>
  hoc_faq_need_computers_a_markdown: |-
    No. We have Hour of Code tutorials that work on PCs, smartphones, tablets, and some that require no computer at all! You can join wherever you are, with whatever you have.

    _Here are a few options:_

    - **Work in pairs.** [Research shows](%{pair_programming_research}) students learn best with [pair programming](%{pair_programming_video}), sharing a computer and working together. Encourage your students to double up.
    - **Use a projected screen.** If you have a projector and screen for a Web-connected computer, your entire group can do an Hour of Code together. Watch video portions together and take turns solving puzzles or answering questions.
    - **Go unplugged.** We offer [tutorials that require no computer](%{unplugged_url}) at all.
  hoc_faq_international_q: Eu sou do <country>. Como posso participar internacionalmente?
  hoc_faq_international_a: Qualquer pessoa pode organizar um evento da Hora do Código,
    em qualquer lugar do mundo. No ano passado, estudantes de todo o mundo se juntaram
    para a Hora do Código. Saiba mais <a href='/promote'>aqui</a>.
  hoc_faq_international_a_markdown: Anyone can organize an Hour of Code event, anywhere
    in the world. Last year, students worldwide joined together for the Hour of Code.
    Find out more [here](%{promote}).
  hoc_faq_tutorial_q: Como posso fazer um tutorial da Hora do Código?
  hoc_faq_tutorial_a: Se estiver interessado em se tornar um parceiro de tutorial,
    <a href='/tutorial-guidelines'>confira nossas diretrizes e instruções</a>. Gostaríamos
    de disponibilizar uma variedade de opções atrativas, mas nosso objetivo principal
    é melhorar a experiência de alunos e professores que são novos no campo da ciência
    da computação.
  hoc_faq_tutorial_a_markdown: If you're interested in becoming a tutorial partner,
    [see our guidelines and instructions](%{tutorial_guidelines}). We'd like to host
    a variety of engaging options, but the primary goal is to optimize the experience
    for students and teachers who are new to computer science.
  hoc_faq_account_q: Os alunos precisam acessar usando uma conta?
  hoc_faq_account_a: Não. Não é necessário nenhum registro ou login para os alunos
    experimentarem a Hora do Código. A maioria dos <a href='%{codeorg_url}/learn/beyond'>cursos
    complementares</a> exige a criação de conta para salvar o progresso do aluno.
    Além disso, o cadastro para a Hora do Código NÃO cria uma conta no Code Studio
    automaticamente. Se você quiser criar contas para seus alunos, siga essas <a href='https://youtu.be/_smelV_KISE'>instruções</a>.
  hoc_faq_account_a_markdown: No. Absolutely no signup or login is required for students
    to try the Hour of Code. Most of the [follow-on courses](%{codeorg_url}/learn/beyond)
    require account creation to save student progress. Also, signing up for the Hour
    of Code does NOT automatically create a Code Studio account. If you do want to
    create accounts for your students, please follow these [instructions](https://youtu.be/_smelV_KISE).
  hoc_faq_high_school_q: Qual atividade devo fazer com alunos do Ensino Médio?
  hoc_faq_high_school_a: Nossos tutoriais sobre Star Wars e Minecraft são ótimos para
    alunos do Ensino Médio, especialmente a versão JavaScript de Star Wars e a atividade
    livre de ambos os tutoriais. Como opção, recomendamos começar com um dos tutoriais
    para iniciantes disponíveis em <a href='%{codeorg_url}/learn'>%{partner_url}/learn</a>,
    como o tutorial com Angry Birds ou com Anna e Elsa. Um aluno do Ensino Médio deve
    conseguir terminar um desses tutoriais em 30 minutos, e depois pode tentar completar
    um tutorial mais avançado em JavaScript, como Khan Academy ou CodeHS.
  hoc_faq_high_school_a_markdown: Our Star Wars and Minecraft tutorials are great
    for high schoolers, especially the Star Wars JavaScript version and the free play
    level on both tutorials. Alternately, we recommend trying one of the beginner
    tutorials on [%{partner_url}/learn](%{codeorg_url}/learn) to start, such as the
    tutorial with Angry Birds or with Anna and Elsa. A high school student should
    be able to finish one of these in 30 minutes and can then try a more advanced
    tutorial in JavaScript, such as Khan Academy or CodeHS.
  hoc_faq_scratch_q: Vou usar o Scratch na Hora do Código, o que devo fazer se meus
    alunos tiverem iPads em vez de laptops?
  hoc_faq_scratch_a: O Scratch não funciona em tablets. Se seus alunos são novinhos,
    eles podem usar o aplicativo ScratchJR iPad (para alunos que estão começando a
    ler). Veja nossos tutoriais em <a href='%{codeorg_url}/learn'>%{partner_url}/learn</a>,
    lá você encontrará os tutoriais que funcionam em iPads - da Code.org, Tynker,
    Lightbot, ou CodeSpark.
  hoc_faq_scratch_a_markdown: Scratch doesn't run on tablets. If your students are
    young, they can use the ScratchJR iPad app (for early-readers). If you look at
    the tutorials on [%{partner_url}/learn](%{codeorg_url}/learn), you can find other
    tutorials that work on iPads - from Code.org, Tynker, Lightbot, or CodeSpark.
  hoc_faq_count_hoc_q: Como podemos contar as Horas do Código?
  hoc_faq_map_q: Por que não vejo meu ponto no mapa?
  hoc_faq_map_a: Lamentamos se você não pode ver seu evento no mapa da Hora do Código.
    Devido a dezenas de milhares de organizadores cadastrados, o mapa agrega os dados
    e exibe um único ponto para vários eventos. Se você clicar no número acima do
    mapa, você vai ser redirecionado para uma lista de todos os eventos por estado,
    e seu evento estará nessa lista. Além disso, dado que milhares de pessoas se cadastram
    na Hora do Código, o mapa e a lista de eventos normalmente levam 48 horas para
    serem atualizados. Verifique novamente em alguns dias!
  hoc_faq_map_a_markdown: We're so sorry you aren't seeing your event on the Hour
    of Code map. Because of the tens of thousands of organizers who sign up, the map
    aggregates the data and displays one point for several events. If you click the
    [events page](%{events_url}) link below the map you will be directed to a list
    of all events by state and can find your event listed there. Additionally, given
    the thousands of people signing up for the Hour of Code, the map and event list
    usually takes 48 hours to update. Check back in a few days!
  hoc_faq_count_hoc_a: O rastreador da Hora do Código não apresenta uma medida exata
    de uso. Não computamos IDs únicos dos alunos ao rastrear a participação na Hora
    do Código, especialmente porque não exigimos que eles façam login ou se cadastrem.
    Consequentemente, contabilizamos participantes a menos e a mais ao mesmo tempo.
    Veja todos os detalhes <a href='%{codeorg_url}/loc'>aqui</a>.
  hoc_faq_count_hoc_a_markdown: The Hour of Code tracker isn't an exact measurement
    of usage. We do not count unique student IDs perfectly when tracking participation
    in the Hour of Code, especially because we don't require students to log in or
    register. As a result, we both over-count and under-count participants at the
    same time. Read all the details [here](%{codeorg_url}/loc).
  hoc_faq_one_hour_q: Quanto pode-se aprender em uma hora?
  hoc_faq_one_hour_a: O objetivo da Hora do Código não é ensinar as pessoas a serem
    experts em ciência da computação em uma hora. Uma hora é suficiente apenas para
    aprender que a ciência da computação é divertida e criativa, que é acessível para
    todas as idades e para todos os alunos, independentemente do conhecimento que
    eles tenham. A medida do sucesso dessa campanha não está no quanto os alunos de
    ciência da computação aprendem - o sucesso é refletido na grande participação
    de todos os gêneros e grupos étnicos e socioeconômicos, e no aumento resultante
    na inscrição e na participação que vemos em cursos de computação em todos os níveis.
    Milhões dos professores e alunos participantes decidiram ir além de uma hora -
    para aprender por um dia inteiro, uma semana inteira ou ainda mais, e muitos alunos
    decidiram se inscrever em um curso completo (ou até mesmo em um curso universitário)
    como resultado. <br/><br/> Além dos alunos, outro "aprendiz" é o educador que
    ganha a confiança, depois de uma hora, de que ele pode ensinar computação mesmo
    sem ter uma graduação em ciência da computação. Dezenas de milhares de professores
    decidem se aprofundar na ciência da computação, participando de DP ou de cursos
    on-line, ou ambos. E isso também se aplica aos administradores das escolas, que
    percebem que a ciência da computação é algo que seus alunos querem aprender e
    que seus professores são capazes de ensinar. <br/><br/> Acima de tudo, o que todos
    os participantes podem aprender em uma hora é que somos capazes de fazer isso.
  hoc_faq_one_hour_a_markdown: |-
    The goal of the Hour of Code is not to teach anybody to become an expert computer scientist in one hour. One hour is only enough to learn that computer science is fun and creative, that it is accessible at all ages, for all students, regardless of background. The measure of success of this campaign is not in how much CS students learn - the success is reflected in broad participation across gender and ethnic and socioeconomic groups, and the resulting increase in enrollment and participation we see in CS courses at all grade levels. Millions of the participating teachers and students have decided to go beyond one hour -  to learn for a whole day or a whole week or longer, and many students have decided to enroll in a whole course (or even a college major) as a result.

    Besides the students, another "learner" is the educator who gains the confidence after one hour that they can teach computer science even though they may not have a college degree as a computer scientist. Tens of thousands of teachers decide to pursue computer science further, either attending PD or offering follow-on online courses, or both. And this applies to school administrators too, who realize that computer science is something their students want and their teachers are capable of.

    Above all, what all participants can learn in an hour is that we can do this.

    where you can print certificates for your entire class ahead of time. You can
    also print out [special certificates](%{codeorg_url}/certificates?course=mc) for
    students doing the Minecraft tutorial.
  hoc_faq_logo_q: Existem restrições sobre como eu posso usar o logotipo ou nome da
    Hour of Code?
  hoc_faq_logo_a: Hour of Code é uma marca registrada. Não queremos impedir seu uso,
    mas sim garantir que ele esteja de acordo com alguns limites. Veja <a href='https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/215831637-Are-there-limitations-of-how-I-can-use-the-Hour-of-Code-logo-'>essas
    diretrizes de uso</a>.
  hoc_faq_logo_a_markdown: Hour of Code is trademarked. We don't want to prevent its
    usage, but we want to make sure its usage fits within a few limits. Please see
