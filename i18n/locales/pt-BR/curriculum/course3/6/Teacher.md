## Extended Learning

<a name="Extended"></a>Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### Functionalize Your Classroom

  * Brainstorm a list of daily classroom activities with students (turning in work, lining up for recess, eating lunch, etc.)
  * Break students into small groups and assign each group an activitiy and a big sheet of paper
  * Each group will write the daily activity as a function and create a poster with that function's "code"
  * As a whole class you can then write a program for a typical day in class, calling each group's function as necessary
