## K-1 Lesson Overview

Loops are a handy way of describing actions that repeat a certain number of times. In this lesson, students will practice converting sets of actions into a single loop.

## Getting Started (15 min)

### <a name="Review"></a> 1) Review

This is a great time to review the last lesson that you went through with your class. We suggest you alternate between asking questions of the whole class and having students talk about their answers in small groups.

Here are some questions that you can ask in review:

  * What did we do last time?

  * What do you wish we had had a chance to do?

  * Did you think of any questions after the lesson that you want to ask?

  * What was your favorite part of the last lesson?

[tip]

# Lesson Tip

Finishing the review by asking about the students' favorite things helps to leave a positive impression of the previous exercise, increasing excitement for the activity that you are about to introduce.

### <a name="Vocab"></a> 2) Vocabulary

This lesson has one new and important vocabulary word:  


[centerIt]

![](vocab.png)

[/centerIt]

**Loop** - Say it with me: Loop   
The action of doing something over and over again

[/together]

### <a name="GetStarted"></a> 3) Repeat After Me

  * Ask for a volunteer and have them stand.
    
      * Instruct your volunteer to walk around the table (or their chair, or a friend).
      * When they finish, instruct them to do it again, using the exact same words you did before.
      * When they finish, instruct again.
      * Then again.

  * Would it have been easier for me to just ask you to go around the table four times?
    
      * What if I wanted you to do it ten times?

  * If I want you to repeat an action 10 times, that's called "looping."

  * When I know in advance that I want you to do something a certain number of times, it's easier for both of us if I just ask you to "Repeat it that many times."

  * Can you think of some other things that we could loop?

## Activity: (15 min)

### <a name="Activity1"></a> 4) [Getting Loopy](/curriculum/course2/5/Activity5-GettingLoopy.pdf)

Today, we're going to have a dance party!

Sometimes, when you know that you will be doing something over and over, it is helpful to know how many times it needs to be done before you begin. That way, you can keep track of how many actions you have left as you go.

Example:

> If your mom wanted you to play her favorite song over and over, she wouldn’t say:
> 
> > *“Please play my song, play my song, play my song, play my song.”*
> 
> She would most likely say:
> 
> > *“Please play my song four times.”*

> **Directions:**
> 
>   1. Look at the dance moves provided on the [Getting Loopy Worksheet](/curriculum/course2/5/Activity5-GettingLoopy.pdf).   
>       
>     ![](iteration.png)
> 
>   2. Show the class what the entire dance looks like done at full-speed.
> 
>   3. Run through the dance slowly, one instruction at a time, with the class.
>   4. Can you find the loop in the instructions? 
>       * What would the dance look like if we only repeated the main part 2 times?
>       * What if we repeated the main part 4 times?
>   5. Can you find anything else in the dance that we could use a loop for?

## Wrap-up (10 min)

### <a name="WrapUp"></a> 5) Flash Chat: What did we learn?

  * Do you think it is easier to add more pictures to the screen or change the number of times we loop? 
      * Would your answer be the same if we wanted to loop 100 times?
  * Could we use these same loops with different dance moves?
  * Do you know any dances that are done inside a loop?
  * What was your favorite part about that activity?

[/together]

[together]

## Assessment (10 min)

### <a name="Assessment"></a>6) Assessment Worksheet: [Getting Loopy Assessment](/curriculum/course2/5/Assessment5-GettingLoopy.pdf)

  * Hand out the worksheet titled "Getting Loopy" and allow students to complete the activity independently after the instructions have been well explained. 
  * This should feel familiar, thanks to the previous activities.

[/together]

## Extended Learning

Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### So Moving

  * Give the students pictures of actions or dance moves that they can do. 
      * Have students arrange moves and add loops to choreograph their own dance.
  * Share the dances with the rest of the class. 

### Connect It Back

  * Find some YouTube videos of popular dances that repeat themselves.
  * Can your class find the loops?
  * Try the same thing with songs!
