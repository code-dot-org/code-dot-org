          description: Byrjaðu með Námskeið 1 fyrir byrjendur í lestri. Nemendur búa til tölvuforrit sem munu hjálpa þeim að læra að vinna með öðrum, þróa hæfni til að leysa verkefni og gefast ekki upp þó verkefni séu erfið. Við lok námskeiðsins búa nemendur til sinn eiginn sérhannaða leik eða sögu sem þeir geta svo deilt. Er stílað inn á aldurshópinn 5 - 6 ára (K-1).

          description: |-
            In this unit, students extend their understanding of the internet and how it functions by building off the concepts learned when sending bits in Unit 1. The unit largely explores the
            structure and design of the internet and the implications of those design decisions including
            the reliability of network communication, the security of data, and personal privacy. Topics
            include the Internet Protocol (IP), DNS, TCP/IP, cryptography and other security and hacking
            concerns.

          description: Being able to digitally manipulate data, visualize it, and identify patterns, trends and possible meanings are important practical skills that computer scientists do every day. The data-rich world we live in also introduces many complex questions related to public policy, law, ethics and societal impact. Understanding where data comes from, having intuitions about what could be learned or extracted from it, and being able to use computational tools to manipulate data and communicate about it are the primary skills addressed in the unit.

          title: CSP Unit 2 - Digital Information
          description: This unit further explores the ways that digital information is encoded, represented and manipulated. Being able to digitally manipulate data, visualize it, and identify patterns, trends and possible meanings are important practical skills that computer scientists do every day. Understanding where data comes from, having intuitions about what could be learned or extracted from it, and being able to use computational tools to manipulate data and communicate about it are the primary skills addressed in the unit.
          description_short: Explore how more complex digitial information is represented and manipulated through computation and visuzalization.
