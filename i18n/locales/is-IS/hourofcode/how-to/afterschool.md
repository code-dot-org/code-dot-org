# How to teach one Hour of Code in after-school classes and clubs

Join the movement and introduce a group of students to their first hour of computer science with these steps. The Hour of Code is easy to run - even for beginners! If you'd like an extra set of hands to help out, you can find a [local volunteer](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/volunteer/local') %) to help run an Hour of Code in your class.

## 1. Watch this how-to video <iframe width="500" height="255" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/SrnvvWDm73k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen mark="crwd-mark"></iframe> 

## 2. Choose a tutorial

We provide a variety of [fun, hour-long tutorials](%= resolve_url('/learn') %) for participants all ages, created by a variety of partners. [Endilega prófaðu!](%= resolve_url('/learn') %)

**All Hour of Code tutorials** require minimal prep-time for organizers, and are self-guided - allowing kids to work at their own pace and skill-level.

## 3. Promote your Hour of Code

Promote your Hour of Code [with these tools](%= resolve_url('/promote') %) and encourage others to host their own events.

## 4. Plan your technology needs - computers are optional

The best Hour of Code experience includes Internet-connected computers. But you **don’t** need a computer for every child, and you can even do the Hour of Code without a computer at all.

Make sure to test tutorials on student computers or devices to ensure they work properly on browsers with sound and video. **Have low bandwidth?** Plan to show videos at the front of the class, so each student isn't downloading their own videos. Or try the unplugged / offline tutorials.

Provide headphones for your class, or ask students to bring their own, if the tutorial you choose works best with sound.

**Don't have enough devices?** Use [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q). When students partner up, they help each other and rely less on the teacher. They’ll also see that computer science is social and collaborative.

## 5. Start your Hour of Code off with an inspiring video

Kick off your Hour of Code by inspiring participants and discussing how computer science impacts every part of our lives.

**Show an inspirational video:**

- The original Code.org launch video, featuring Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and NBA star Chris Bosh - there are [1 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYZF6oIZtfc), [5 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc), and [9 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1xS07N-FA) versions available.
- The [Hour of Code Worldwide video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsOIlDT145A)
- [President Obama calling on all students to learn computer science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvmhE1J9PY).
- Find more inspirational videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNfpD8i4Sx7U0y2MccnrNZuP).

**It’s okay if you are all brand new to computer science. Here are some ideas to introduce your Hour of Code activity:**

- Explain ways technology impacts our lives, with examples both boys and girls will care about (Talk about apps and technology that is used to save lives, help people, connect people etc).
- Teldu upp hluti sem nota kóða dagsdaglega.
- See tips for getting girls interested in computer science [here](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/girls') %).

**Need more guidance?** Download this [template lesson plan](/files/AfterschoolEducatorLessonPlanOutline.docx).

## 6. Code!

**Direct participants to the activity**

- Write the tutorial link on a whiteboard. Find the link listed on the [information for your selected tutorial](%= resolve_url('/learn') %) under the number of participants.

**When someone comes across difficulties it's okay to respond:**

- "Ég veit það ekki. Reynum að leysa þetta saman."
- "Tæknin virkar ekki alltaf eins og við viljum"
- "Að læra að forrita er líkt og að læra nýtt tungumál; þú verður ekki fullnuma strax."

**What to do if someone finishes early?**

- Encourage participants to try another Hour of Code activity at [hourofcode.com/learn](%= resolve_url('/learn') %)
- Or, ask those who finish early to help others who are having trouble.
