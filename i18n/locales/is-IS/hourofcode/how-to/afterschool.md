# How to teach one Hour of Code in after-school classes and clubs

### Join the movement and introduce your students to computer science with these steps.

Computational thinking helps nurture problem-solving skills, logic, and creativity. And technology is transforming every industry on the planet. Students today should learn how to create technology, not just use it. By starting early, they’ll have a foundation for success in any 21st-century career path.

Trying an Hour of Code is a simple and fun way to introduce students to computer science, perhaps for the very first time. If you'd like an extra set of hands to help out, you can find a [local volunteer]({{ urls/volunteer_local }}) to help run an Hour of Code in your after-school class or club.

### An Hour of Code can also be hosted remotely! To get started, check out our [tips for hosting a virtual Hour of Code event](https://hourofcode.com/us/how-to/virtual).

## 1. Watch this how-to video <iframe width="500" height="255" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/SrnvvWDm73k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen mark="crwd-mark"></iframe> 

## 2. Choose a tutorial

We provide a variety of [fun, hour-long tutorials]({{ urls/learn }}) for participants all ages, created by a variety of partners. [Try them out!]({{ urls/learn }})

**All Hour of Code tutorials** require minimal prep-time for organizers, and are self-guided - allowing kids to work at their own pace and skill-level.

**Need a lesson plan for your afterschool Hour of Code?** Check out this [template](/files/AfterschoolEducatorLessonPlanOutline.docx)!

## 3. Promote your Hour of Code

Promote your Hour of Code [with these tools]({{ urls/promote }}) and encourage others to host their own events.

## 4. Plan your technology needs - computers are optional

The best Hour of Code experience includes Internet-connected computers. But you **don’t** need a computer for every child, and you can even do the Hour of Code without a computer at all.

Make sure to test tutorials on student computers or devices to ensure they work properly on browsers with sound and video. **Have low bandwidth?** Plan to show videos at the front of the class, so each student isn't downloading their own videos. Or try the unplugged / offline tutorials.

Provide headphones for your class, or ask students to bring their own, if the tutorial you choose works best with sound.

**Don't have enough devices?** Use [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q). When students partner up, they help each other and rely less on the teacher. They’ll also see that computer science is social and collaborative.

## 5. Start your Hour of Code off with an inspiring video

Kick off your Hour of Code by inspiring participants and discussing how computer science impacts every part of our lives.

**Sýna hvetjandi myndband:**

- The original Code.org launch video, featuring Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and NBA star Chris Bosh - there are [1 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYZF6oIZtfc), [5 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc), and [9 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1xS07N-FA) versions available.
- The [Hour of Code Worldwide video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsOIlDT145A)
- [President Obama calling on all students to learn computer science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvmhE1J9PY).
- Find more inspirational videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNfpD8i4Sx7U0y2MccnrNZuP).

**Það er í lagi að þú ert nýgræðingur í tölvufræðum. Hér eru nokkrar hugmyndir til að kynna "Klukkutíma af forritun":**

- Útskýrðu hvernig tækni hefur áhrif á líf þitt, með dæmum sem vekja áhuga hjá bæði drengjum og stúlkum (talaðu um öpp og tækni sem notuð eru til að bjarga mannslífum, hjálpa fólki, tengja fólk o.s.frv.).
- Teldu upp hluti sem nota kóða dagsdaglega.
- See tips for getting girls interested in computer science [here]({{ urls/girls }}).

**Need more guidance?** Download this [template lesson plan](/files/AfterschoolEducatorLessonPlanOutline.docx).

## 6. Code!

**Direct participants to the activity** - Write the tutorial link on a whiteboard. Find the link listed on the [information for your selected tutorial]({{ urls/learn }}) under the number of participants.

**When someone comes across difficulties it's okay to respond:** - “I don’t know. Let’s figure this out together.” - “Technology doesn’t always work out the way we want.” - “Learning to program is like learning a new language; you won’t be fluent right away.”

**What to do if someone finishes early?** - Encourage participants to try another Hour of Code activity at [hourofcode.com/learn]({{ urls/learn }}) - Or, ask those who finish early to help others who are having trouble.

## 7. Celebrate

- [Print certificates]({{ urls/certificates }}) for your students.
- [Print "I did an Hour of Code!"]({{ promote/resources_stickers }}) stickers for your students.
- [Order custom t-shirts](http://blog.code.org/post/132608499493/hour-of-code-shirts-and-more) for participants.
- Deildu myndum og myndböndum af þinni Klukkustund kóðunar á samfélagsmiðlum. Notaðu #HourOfCode og @codeorg svo að við getum líka dregið athygli að góðu gengi ykkar!
