## Bring the Hour of Code to your entire community.

### Get every school participating, every student learning!

1. **Recruit local schools and districts.** Use <a href="<%= hoc_uri('/resources#sample-emails') %>">this email</a> or <a href="<%= hoc_uri('/resources/stats') %>">this blurb</a> as a starting point, and take a look at this <a href="<%= hoc_uri('/resources/how-to') %>">how-to</a> for schools and districts. Let them know **every** participating educator will receive a <a href="<%= hoc_uri('/resources/how-to') %>">thank you gift</a> and in **each state**, one participating school will win **$10,000 in technology**!

2. **Host an Hour of Code event.** See our <a href="<%= hoc_uri('/resources/how-to-event') %>">event how-to guide</a> for a sample run of show, media outreach kit and other event-planning resources. Hosting an event is a great way to promote the Hour of Code and increase participation. 

3. **Attend an event during Computer Science Education Week (Dec 7-13).** <a href="<%= hoc_uri('/events') %>">Find classrooms and schools</a> participating in your district, city or state. 

4. **Issue a proclamation or resolution.** See this <a href="<%= hoc_uri('resources/proclamation') %>">sample resolution</a> supportive of Computer Science Education Week and its goals that could be used by state and local legislators.

5. **Draft an op-ed**. Consider publishing an opinion piece in your local paper. See this <a href="<%= hoc_uri('/resources/op-ed') %>">sample op-ed</a>  supporting comupter supportive of Computer Science Education Week and its goals.

6. **Spread the word.** [Share the Hour of Code video on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fhourofcode.com%2Fus) and [talk about your support on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhourofcode.com&text=I%27m%20participating%20in%20this%20year%27s%20%23HourOfCode%2C%20are%20you%3F%20%40codeorg&original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fq%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Ftwitter.com%252Fshare%253Fhashtags%253D%2526amp%253Brelated%253Dcodeorg%2526amp%253Btext%253DI%252527m%252Bparticipating%252Bin%252Bthis%252Byear%252527s%252B%252523HourOfCode%25252C%252Bare%252Byou%25253F%252B%252540codeorg%2526amp%253Burl%253Dhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fhourofcode.com%26sa%3DD%26sntz%3D1%26usg%3DAFQjCNE1GLTUbKZfMlEh9Aj5w0iswz6PYQ&related=codeorg&hashtags=).  Share pictures of events or a video of you and other adults doing the Hour of Code. Use the hashtag **#HourOfCode** so Code.org (@code.org) can see it and promote the support. Or, use these sample tweets:
	- Every student, boy or girl, should have the chance to learn computer science. Join us in starting with one #HourOfCode [http://hourofcode.com](http://hourofcode.com)
	- Today, we're proud to join the Hour of Code movement. Are you in? #HourOfCode [http://hourofcode.com](http://hourofcode.com).

7. **Issue a press release.** <a href="<%= hoc_uri('/resources/official-press-release') %>">Use this sample</a> as a guide.

8. **Connect locally.** Visit [http://code.org/promote](http://code.org/promote) to learn more about computer science education in your state. Sign the petition there and youâ€™ll get updates from Code.org on their local, state and federal advocacy efforts.
