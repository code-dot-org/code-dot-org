A MobileNet model is a <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/practica/image-classification/convolutional-neural-networks">convolutional neural network</a> that has been trained on <a href="http://www.image-net.org/">ImageNet</a>, a dataset of over 14 million images hand-annotated with words such as "balloon" or "strawberry". In order to customize this model with the labeled training data the student generates in this activity, we use a technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning">Transfer Learning</a>. Each image in the training dataset is fed to MobileNet, as pixels, to obtain a list of annotations that are most likely to apply to it. Then, for a new image, we feed it to MobileNet and compare its resulting list of annotations to those from the training dataset. We classify the new image with the same label (such as "fish" or "not fish") as the images from the training set with the most similar results.'

  dance_ai_behind_the_scenes_markdown: "In **Dance Party: AI Edition**, three selected emojis are used to generate an output effect using AI. An output effect consists of values for background effect, background color palette, and foreground effect.\n\nEach emoji and each output value has a descriptive phrase associated with it. By comparing the similarity of an input emoji's phrase with an output value's phrase, we are able to use AI to recommend the best match.\n\nTo compute the similarity, each phrase is assigned an embedding. An [embedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding) is a list of numbers that captures the meaning of a phrase, and the embeddings used in **Dance Party: AI Edition** are about 1,500 numbers long. Similarity is measured by the \"distance\" between the phrases' embeddings.  In **Dance Party: AI Edition**, we use embeddings generated by the [Amazon Bedrock Titan model](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/titan/) and calculate similarity by computing the cosine distance between embeddings."

  farsi_page_global_desc_01: "When you think of an algorithm, you may assume it's something new, but the concept of an algorithm was discovered in Iran over 1300 years ago. “Algorithm” is named after its inventor, the mathematician Al Khwarizmi, who lived in the land formerly known as Persia and now known as Iran. Once the epicenter of mathematics, science, philosophy, and medicine, Iran has made profound advances and impacts in technology."
  farsi_page_global_desc_02: "Beyond the borders of the country itself, Iranians around the world have contributed in countless ways to science and technology — as co-founders or CEOs of technology companies such as Uber, eBay, Intuit, and Dropbox, or inventing technologies such as LASIK surgery or JPEG compression, or in scientific, academic, or engineering roles around the globe."

You can join wherever you are, with whatever you have.\n\n_Here are a few options:_\n\n- **Work in pairs.** [Research shows](%{pair_programming_research}) students learn best with [pair programming](%{pair_programming_video}), sharing a computer and working together. Encourage your students to double up.\n- **Use a projected screen.** If you have a projector and screen for a Web-connected computer, your entire group can do an Hour of Code together. Watch video portions together and take turns solving puzzles or answering questions.\n- **Go unplugged.** We offer [tutorials that require no computer](%{unplugged_url}) at all."
  hoc_faq_international_q: "I am in <country>. How do I participate internationally?"
  hoc_faq_international_a_markdown: "Anyone can organize an Hour of Code event, anywhere in the world. Last year, students worldwide joined together for the Hour of Code. Find out more [here](%{promote})."
  hoc_faq_tutorial_q: 'How can I make an Hour of Code tutorial?'
  hoc_faq_tutorial_a_markdown: "If you're interested in becoming a tutorial partner, [see our guidelines and instructions](%{tutorial_guidelines}). We'd like to host a variety of engaging options, but the primary goal is to optimize the experience for students and teachers who are new to computer science."
  hoc_faq_account_q: "Do students need to log on using an account?"
  hoc_faq_account_a_markdown: "No. Absolutely no signup or login is required for students to try the Hour of Code. Most of the [follow-on courses](%{beyond_url}) require account creation to save student progress. Also, signing up for the Hour of Code does NOT automatically create a Code Studio account. If you do want to create accounts for your students, please follow these [instructions](%{section_instructions_url})."
  hoc_faq_high_school_q: "Which activity should I do with high school students?"
  hoc_faq_high_school_a_markdown: "Our Star Wars and Minecraft tutorials are great for high schoolers, especially the Star Wars JavaScript version and the free play level on both tutorials. Alternately, we recommend trying one of the beginner tutorials on [hourofcode.com/learn](%{learn_url}) to start, such as the tutorial with Angry Birds or with Frozen's Anna and Elsa. A high school student should be able to finish one of these in 30 minutes and can then try a more advanced tutorial in JavaScript, such as Khan Academy or CodeHS."
  hoc_faq_scratch_q: "I am doing Scratch for Hour of Code, but what if my students have iPads rather than laptops?"
  hoc_faq_scratch_a_markdown: "Scratch doesn't run on tablets. If your students are young, they can use the ScratchJR iPad app (for early-readers). If you look at the tutorials on [%{partner_url}/learn](%{codeorg_url}/learn), you can find other tutorials that work on iPads - from Code.org, Tynker, Lightbot, or CodeSpark."
  hoc_faq_count_hoc_q: "How do you count Hours of Code?"
  hoc_faq_map_q: "Why don't I see my dot on the map?"
  hoc_faq_map_a_markdown: "We're so sorry you aren't seeing your event on the Hour of Code map. Because of the tens of thousands of organizers who sign up, the map aggregates the data and displays one point for several events. If you click the [events page](%{events_url}) link below the map, you will be directed to a list of all events by state and can find your event listed there. Additionally, given the thousands of people signing up for the Hour of Code, the map and event list usually takes 48 hours to update. Check back in a few days!"
  hoc_faq_count_hoc_a_markdown: "We do not count unique student IDs perfectly when tracking participation in the Hour of Code. Why? Partly because we don't want the friction of prompting to “login / register” before a student or classroom tries learning for the first time, and partly because there are many activities we cannot track online. We do take certain steps to reduce double-counting, but without a login prompt, this can't work perfectly. At the same time, there are MANY student activities in the Hour of Code that aren't tracked at all. For example: (1) students who use a mobile/tablet app to try the Hour of Code are typically not counted (2) students who share a screen for pair-programming or group-programming may be counted as one (3) students trying an unplugged classroom activity cannot be counted online (4) teachers who create their own Hour of Code activities. As a result, there is some under-counting and some double-counting, and so we do not view the Hour of Code tracker to be an exact measure of usage. It is certainly directionally correct, and shows that many tens of millions of students have participated."
  hoc_faq_one_hour_q: "How much can one learn in an hour?"
  hoc_faq_one_hour_a_markdown: "The goal of the Hour of Code is not to teach anybody to become an expert computer scientist in one hour. One hour is only enough to learn that computer science is fun and creative, and that it's accessible at all ages and for all students, regardless of background. The measure of success of this campaign is not in how much CS students learn - the success is reflected in broad participation across gender, racial/ethnic, and socioeconomic groups, and the resulting increase in enrollment and participation we see in CS courses at all grade levels. Millions of the participating teachers and students have decided to go beyond one hour - to learn for a whole day or a whole week or longer, and many students have decided to enroll in a whole course (or even a college major) as a result.\n\nBesides the students, another \"learner\" is the educator who gains the confidence after one hour that they can teach computer science even though they may not have a college degree as a computer scientist. Tens of thousands of teachers decide to pursue computer science further, either attending professional development or follow-on online courses, or both. And this applies to school administrators too, who realize that computer science is something their students want and their teachers are capable of.\n\nAbove all, what all participants can learn in an hour is that anyone can learn computer science!"
  hoc_faq_more_questions_q: "Still have more questions?"
  hoc_faq_more_questions_a_markdown: "Try finding an answer in our [support forum](http://support.code.org)."
  hoc_faq_keep_learning_q: "How do I keep learning after the Hour of Code?"
  hoc_faq_keep_learning_a_markdown: "Anyone can host an Hour of Code at any time. The tutorials stay up year-round. You can expect all our tutorials and curriculum to be available on our site in perpetuity. Please go to [our resources](%{promote}) for event how-to guides and other resources to help make your Hour of Code event a success."
  hoc_faq_certificates_q: "Where can I print certificates for my students?"
  hoc_faq_certificates_answer_markdown: "Go to our [certificates page](%{certificates_url}) where you can print certificates for your entire class ahead of time."
  hoc_faq_logo_q: "Are there limitations to how I can use the Hour of Code logo or name?"
  hoc_faq_logo_a_markdown: "Hour of Code is trademarked. We don't want to prevent its usage, but we want to make sure its usage fits within a few limits. Please see [these guidelines for usage](%{logo_url})."
  hoc_faq_bug_q: "I found a bug in an Hour of Code activity! What should I do?"
  hoc_faq_bug_a_markdown: "Oh no! If you've come across a bug in an Hour of Code activity - first check the URL for the activity you are on. If the URL starts with studio.code.org, our Code.org Support team can help! Click the question mark icon in the upper right corner of your screen, then select \"Report a problem\" from the dropdown menu.\n\nIf the URL does not start with studio.code.org, you are likely working on a third party activity and will need to reach out to that company's support team for further assistance."

  engineering_our_team_desc: "The engineering team at Code.org is divided into four sub-teams that build and support different areas of our platform:"
  engineering_our_team_sub_title_1: "Student Learning Team"
  engineering_our_team_text_1: "Our Student Learning Team owns all our activities (we call them labs) that our students use each day. This team works mostly on front-end tech (we use React and a lot of custom JS) and we have a great working relationship with many partners and open source projects. For example, we use [Google's Blockly](%{youtube_url}) for all of our block-based programming. We support students in their learning journey all the way from Kindergarten through 12th grade."
  engineering_our_team_sub_title_2: "Teacher Experience Team"
  engineering_our_team_text_2: "Our Teacher Experience Team builds the tools that attract new teachers to Code.org (we call these acquisition products) and develops the platform that empowers our existing teachers to teach our curriculum (our teacher tools). As with our student tools, we rely on React to build our front-end and our server-side components are served using Ruby on Rails."
  engineering_our_team_sub_title_3: "Platform Team"
  engineering_our_team_text_3: "Our Platform Team owns core components that serve the needs of our student and teacher teams (for example, authentication and user profile) and also has the mission of reaching students who we can't yet reach. This includes building integrations that connect us with schools that use different Learning Management Systems (LMS) and packaging our curriculum so that it can be used in remote schools who don't have access to reliable internet."
  engineering_our_team_sub_title_4: "Infrastructure Team"
  engineering_our_team_text_4: "Our Infrastructure Team provides the backbone for the platform that supports our students and teachers. This includes our hosting infrastructure and related services (we use AWS), data management, security programs, developer and deployment services and much more. This team also owns our scaling and provisioning systems, which are critical during Hour of Code, where we invite every student in the world to complete an hour of coding with us."
  engineering_faq_question_1: "What does Code.org do?"
  engineering_faq_answer_1_a: "Code.org is an education innovation nonprofit dedicated to the vision that every student in every school has the opportunity to learn computer science as part of their core K-12 education."
  engineering_faq_answer_1_b: "We expand access to computer science in schools, with a focus on increasing participation by young women and students from other underrepresented groups. The leading provider of K-12 computer science curriculum in the largest school districts in the United States, Code.org also organizes the annual Hour of Code campaign, which has engaged more than 15% of all students in the world."
  engineering_faq_answer_1_c: "Code.org is supported by generous donors including Microsoft, Amazon, Google and many others."
  engineering_faq_question_2: "What is Code.org’s developer experience and tooling?"
  engineering_faq_answer_2: "Our developer experience may be different to what you’ve seen in your past roles. Working closely with our product team, we ship to production every weekday and we have a variety of cadences - sometimes you are writing code that goes live that day; other times you are on longer term projects - and while we do follow 2-weekly sprints, we do so in a lightweight way. We index towards getting the right things done the right way vs. taking a purist view of any particular methodology. [All our code](%{code_url}) is open source and we use JIRA and GitHub pull requests to track all of our work items. We also care a lot about quality and testing and are fortunate to have incredible support from [SauceLabs](%{saucelabs_url}), who help us run our suite of UI tests on various student devices (e.g., iPads) in their cloud device farm."
  engineering_faq_question_3: "What is the engineer on-call rotation at Code.org?"
  engineering_faq_answer_3: 'Our 30+ engineering team shares on-call responsibilities. Each engineer covers a 24-hour shift and uses our escalation paths and playbooks to respond to site outages or other live-site issues. We are proud of our site’s reliability - on average, each engineer is only woken up once per year for issues that are typically quick to resolve. Instead, the "Developer of the Day" usually spends a portion of their workday managing the production deployment and triaging less urgent issues.'
  engineering_faq_question_4: "Are you a remote-friendly / WFH organization?"
  engineering_faq_answer_4_a: "Yes! In 2019, shortly before the pandemic, Code.org became a remote-first organization. Today, we have engineers in every US time zone and accommodate working hours accordingly. Most of our meetings happen between the hours of 10am and 3pm PT."
  engineering_faq_answer_4_b: "We also recognize the value of in-person time, and every quarter we get together in person, typically in Seattle. Two of these events (we call them Kick-off week and “Codechella”) bring everyone in the organization together in January and June - and the engineering and product teams meet separately in April and October."
  engineering_faq_answer_4_c: "We strongly believe in spending time with our students and teachers, so many of these in-person events include trips into schools and classrooms to gather feedback or play-test our products"
  engineering_faq_question_5: "What makes the engineering team at Code.org unique?"
  engineering_faq_answer_5_a: "Beyond solving challenging technical problems, we have a few things that make our engineering org different from others you may have worked in:"
  engineering_faq_answer_5_b_1: "We all share our passion for our mission."
  engineering_faq_answer_5_b_2: "Each of us is here to support the mission to expand access to computer science for every student across the world. We all have our unique story and perspective about what drives us towards this mission."
  engineering_faq_answer_5_c_1: "We care deeply about each other."
  engineering_faq_answer_5_c_2: "When engineers are struggling with an issue, we step in and we help. One of our principles is that we are hard on problems, but kind to each other. We promote engineers regularly, but we don't prescribe over-engineered solutions just to support someone's promotion path. Instead, we invest in our engineers with a generous professional development budget and access to other learning opportunities."
  engineering_faq_answer_5_d_1: "We work hard, but we set clear boundaries."
  engineering_faq_answer_5_d_2: "While we support students across the world, we hold ourselves accountable for clear boundaries between work and home life.
