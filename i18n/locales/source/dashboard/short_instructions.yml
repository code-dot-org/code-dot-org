      Big Game Animation 2 (copy 1): The function 'update-target' function takes the target's current x value, and returns an updated value. Complete the 'update-target' function so that it adds to the x value each time it is called. The more you add to x, the faster the target will go.
      Big Game Animation 2: The update-target function takes the target's current x value, and returns an updated value. Complete the update-target function so that it adds to the x value each time it is called. The more you add to x, the faster the target will go.
      Big Game Animation 3: The update-danger function should work just like update-target, except that the danger should move from the right side over towards the left. Complete update-danger to make the danger fly across the screen.
      Big Game Animation 4: At this point in your game, your danger should run across the screen from right to left, and your target should run across from left to right. They don't ever come back on screen once they've left, but we'll take care of that later. Take a minute to make sure your game is working like you want it to, and then click "Finish" to move on.
      Big Game Booleans 1: When you last worked on your game we got our target and danger sprites to fly across the screen, but they never come back. Click "Run" to see how your game is currently working, and then click finish and we'll work on making those sprites reappear on screen after they've left.
      Big Game Booleans 2: Go to the Functions section of the toolbox and complete the safe-left? function so that it returns true if the sprite's x coordinate is greater than -50. If you're successful you should see the Danger go off the left side and then return on the right side.
      Big Game Booleans 3: Now that you've got safe-left?, let's fill in safe-right? - it should take in a sprite's x coordinate and return true if that coordinate is less than 450. Once your safe-right? is complete you should see the Target go off the right side of the screen and return on the left.
      Big Game Booleans 4: Complete the onscreen? function so that it checks whether both safe-left? and safe-right? are true.
      Big Game Booleans 5: At this point your Danger should run across the screen from right to left, your Target should run across from left to right, and they should both return to the opposite side, repeatedly. Take a minute to make sure your game is working like you want it to, and then click "Finish" to move on.
      Big Game Collision 1 (copy 1): When you last worked on your game we got our target and danger sprites to fly across the screen, but they never come back. Click run to see how your game is currently working, and then click finish and we'll work on making those sprites reappear on screen after they've left.
      Big Game Collision 1: At this point you've programmed a video game with a moving Target and Danger, both of which return to the screen once they've left, and a Player that responds to keyboard input. Click "Run" to see how your game is currently working, and then we'll dig into the final missing piece - collision detection!
      Big Game Collision 2: To move the player up and down, we'll need to use a conditional block to figure out which key is pressed and respond accordingly. Computers read keypresses as numeric key codes - the up arrow is 38 and the down arrow is 40. You can lookup other key codes in your student workbook. Edit the 'update-player' function so that if moves the player up when the up arrow is pressed, or down when the down arrow is pressed.
      Big Game Collision 3: Use the Distance Formula, so the distance function returns the distance between the player's center coordinates (px, py) and another sprite's center coordinates (cx, cy).
      Big Game Collision 4: Complete the collide? function so that it returns true if the distance between two points is less than 100 pixels apart.

        Here is the code for an interesting shape.  What happens when you repeat it multiple times, turning between each iteration?   Notice that the turns in this shape add up to 420 degrees, which means that when your artist is done drawing, it will be facing a different direction than when you started.  That new direction is exactly 60 degrees to the right of where you began.

      Course 4 Artist For Loops 11: 'Remember back in a previous stage when we used a variable to control the number of sides in a shape? We are going to do the same thing with the `counter` variable now. This pattern starts with a triangle and adds one side at a time until it draws a decagon (10 sides). Each side should be 100 pixels long. '

        Let's put it all together!  Using your knowledge of `for` loops and the `counter` variable, create this drawing where each shape has two more sides than the last.  Make sure that each side is 10 times as long as the number of sides in the polygon.

        Very little of the code has been provided for you.

      Course 4 Artist For Loops 13: Hmmm, those shapes are getting bigger every time! Didn't we already solve this problem with variables? How can we use the counter variable to make the sides smaller as there are more of them? Instead of moving forward by a set amount, try moving forward (100 / counter) pixels.
      Course 4 Artist For Loops 14: If you turn a little bit more or less than you normally would for a shape, it creates a neat effect. Try using some of the code from the last level, but turning 89 degrees to create this twisted square spiral.

The triangle sizes are 150 pixels, 75 pixels and 25 pixels.
      Course 4 Artist Params 3: 'Awesome, can you draw each of these triangles with that new function? The first is 25 pixels long, the second is 50, and the third is 75. '
      Course 4 Artist Params 4: Can you add a new function called square? It should also take a length parameter, just like the triangle. This time draw 3 squares 25, 50 and 75 pixels in length,100 pixels apart.
      Course 4 Artist Params 5: 'Use both of your new functions to draw this picture. To make this easier you use a loop with a "counter" parameter. '
      Course 4 Artist Params 6: 'Let''s edit this "draw a shape" function. It already has a "length" parameter. Now, let''s edit the function to also add a "sides" parameter.

Look through the code, and every time you see the number 3, replace it with your "sides" variable. Remember to use the "set sides" block.
      Course 4 Artist Vars 11: Here’s more complicated code using the same concepts from the last puzzle - what should you set the "sides" variable to in order to draw this picture made of squares?
      Course 4 Artist Vars 12: Let's set the "sides" variable to 5. The more sides we add to this algorithm, the bigger this whole pattern gets! Notice that there is another variable called "length". We can now use that wherever we have a "move forward." Set the "length" variable to 75 for this shape.
      Course 4 Artist Vars 13: "When a shape has lots of sides, each side needs to be shorter if you want the whole pattern to fit on the screen. \nLet's recreate the algorithm for this amazing pattern, but instead of manually setting the `length` variable, let's use a math block with the `sides` variable inside to make sure that each shape fits correctly.

      Course 4 Maze 6: Can you solve this puzzle using the fewest number of blocks possible?
      Course 4 Play Lab For Loops 2: This time, let's try counting the odd numbers from 1 to 100.
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 1: Here's a function called `jump` that causes your main character to jump up 100 pixels. Run the program and use the jump function to collect all of the flags by moving the dog with the arrow keys.
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 10: "We've added one last function for you. \n\nUse an \"if\" statement to program your game to call the \"level_up\" function only when \"player_score\" becomes greater than a certain number.\n\nFor example: \"player_score\" > 6\n\nPlay the game, and make it to level 3 to move to the next puzzle. "
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 2: "Now we've got flags that are too high for our current jump! Let's use both the \"up\" and \"down\" arrows so that we can have multiple jump heights.  \n\nWe need to add a parameter to our jump function called \"height\".  The up arrow should cause the dog to jump 200 pixels and the down arrow should make it jump only 100 pixels. "
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 3: 'We have added another parameter to the jump function so that we can use it with other actors. Each actor is represented by a number, starting from one. Edit the "jump" function so that it uses the "actor" parameter to make the correct character jump. '
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 4: "Here's a function called `patrol`. \n\nEdit `patrol` to move Cat up 400 pixels and then down 400 pixels."
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 5: Edit the the "patrol" function to add an "actor" parameter, so that we can call it for each of the actors on the screen. Remember, the actors correspond to numbers 1, 2, and 3.
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 6: Add another parameter called "speed" to the "patrol" function. Try using a "set speed" block with the new "speed" parameter to help Penguin get both flags before the other sprites even get one.
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 7: "Let's have some fun! Look at the code provided to see if you can figure out what each block does.  \nWhen you're done, use the arrow keys to control Dog and collect all of the flags.\nNOTE: You don't need to make any changes to the program"
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 8: Use the `when actor touches` block to send Dog back to the top-left ONLY if Dog touches any of the other actors.
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 9: "Here's our game from an earlier stage, but most of the code is hidden. There’s a new function `score_points.`\n\nEdit the function so that a new parameter called `points` can be added to `player_score`. \n\nThe variable `player_score` should increase each time Dog tags Cat with pie, and decrease each time that Cat tags Dog with a sandwich.\n\nNote: When you're done, click \"Run\" to play.  When Dog scores 6 points, you will move on to the next puzzle. "
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 1: This time you don't have to write any code, just hit "Run" to play the game! In this game, you're the dog who is trying to collect more flags than the cat. Use the down arrow to control the dog. Press "Finish" when you're done playing.
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 2: The race in that last puzzle wasn't very fair! Change the `dog_speed` variable to make sure you can collect more flags than Cat. The first to collect 10 flags wins!
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 3: Use the left and right arrows to move, and the up arrow to jump. See if you can collect all of the flags.
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 4: Now we're using a variable called "height" to control how high the dog can jump. Update the "height" variable so that the dog can jump high enough to reach all the flags.
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 5: 'Let''s build a game! First we''ll need a score. Rebuild the code that you saw in the last level to set the score to 10. '
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 6 (copy 1): Cool, now we've got our score variable, but how are we going to make it useful? How about adding to your score variable each time you hit the enemy with a fireball? Use the "when actor 2 touches anything" event to trigger an update to your score when your fireballs hit the cat. You can increment the score by setting score = score + 1. Get your score up to 10 (going one at a time!) to pass the level.
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 6: |-
        Use the right arrow to throw pie.

        In our game, how should we score points? Add 1 to your "points" variable each time Dog hits Cat with a piece of pie. Use the "when actor 2 touches anything" event to trigger an update to your score. You can increment your variable by setting "points = points + 1." Get your score up to 10 (going one at a time!) to pass the level.
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 7: Nice, now let's make sure this game isn't too easy to play. Any time Dog (actor 1) gets hit by a sandwich from Cat (actor 2), you should lose a point. Start with 10 points so it's not too hard. Let your score drop down from 10 to 0 to pass the level.
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 8 (copy 1): Alright, one last thing for this game - let's set it up so the player can win (or lose). Use a forever loop to check the value of score - if score is ever greater that 20, make the enemy vanish. If the score is every less than 0, make the player vanish. Click "Finish" when the game works like you'd like it to.

      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 1: Let's make the dog speak every number from 1 to 100. Use a `for` loop and the counter block to speak the counter variable each time the loop is run.
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 2: This time, help Olive the Cat count only the odd numbers from 1 to 101.
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 3: If we count by larger numbers, we count even higher in the same amount of time. Try making Pirate Pegleg count from 10 up to 1000, adding 10 at a time.
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 4: Changing the increment can be helpful, but we're still counting linearly (each number is the same distance from the last) What if I wanted to count exponentially? Without changing the settings in this for loop, can you count 1, 4, 9 , 16, 25... (counter squared)?
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 4a: "Now, let's blend the variables from Stage 7 together with your \"counter\" variable to make some magic happen.   \n\nIn this puzzle, Dog will count from 0 to 1000 by \"increment\".  Set the \"increment\" variable to 10 at the beginning of your code to see what happens."
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 5: In the last stage we counted the square of each number. Try changing "counter ^ 2" to "counter ^ 3" to count the cube of each number (1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343…)
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 5a: |-
        In this puzzle, Dog will be your time keeper.

        Dog will count from 0 to 30 by "increment".  The "increment" variable will begin with a value of 1.

        Can you make it so that each time you click Dog, the increment increases by 2?  Click the forward arrow to run the for loop.

        Run the loop a couple of times, clicking Dog before each one.
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 6: You may recall that a prime number is any whole number that is only divisible by itself and 1. Use the "is_prime" function to speak out only the prime numbers from 1 to 100.
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 6a: |-
        Dog will still keep time by counting with our "for loop" by "increment", but this time, we will add The Wizard into the mix.  Can you change the code so that "increment" goes up by two each time The Wizard is clicked?

        Watch out!  The Wizard moves quickly!
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 7: Could you use a for loop to help me speak the sequence 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25?
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 7a: "Now we're getting somewhere!  What if we start counting how many times we can click The Wizard before Dog gets to 30?  \n\nFinish adding blocks to The Wizard so that every time he's clicked the variable \"clicked\" increases by one. You can ignore \"increment\" for now.\n\nDog will start counting when you click \"Run\"."
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 8: "Now, help the actors move as they count.  \n\nDog should move and count by adding 2 (counter + 2) each time.  Cat will move and count by multiplying by 2 (counter * 2)  each time. Penguin will move and count to the power of 2 (counter ^ 2) each time.  Who will reach their flag first?"
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 8a: |-
        To finish our game, we need to bring back the "increment" variable!    Let's tie it to the level of the game.

        1) Keep track of the number of times The Wizard is clicked.
        2) If The Wizard is clicked at least 10 times before Dog counts to 30, raise "increment" by 1 and start again.
        3) If The Wizard does not get clicked at least 10 times, the game is over.

      Eval Booleans 1: Boolean operators (like >, <, =) allow us to compare different values, returning either true or false. Click "Run" to see how this expression evaluates.
      Eval Booleans 2: Can you set the values so that this expression evaluates as true?
      Eval Booleans 3: The string-length function returns the number of characters in a string (including spaces!) - make this code evaluate to true.
      Eval Booleans 4: Here's an Evaluation Block called AND - it returns true if both of its parameters are true, otherwise it returns false. Edit the x variable so that this expression returns true.
      Eval Booleans 5: This OR block returns true if either of its parameters is true. Otherwise, if both parameters are false it will return false. Set the y variable to a value that will cause this expression to return false.
      Eval Booleans 6: Here's one more boolean block called NOT. This block flips true to false, or false to true. If you wrap this block of code in a NOT block, it should return true (because we are asking if the two expressions do NOT produce equal values).
      Eval Booleans Free Play: 'Free Play: Try out some creations of your own using Booleans.'
      Eval Booleans: Booleans allow us to compare different values, returning "true" if the are equal, or "false" if they are not. What do you think this code will evaluate to?
      Eval Cond 1: The cond block checks the boolean expressions in the left column, and as soon as it finds one that returns "true" it runs the corresponding code on the right. If none of the expressions evaluate to "true," it runs the bottom block. Update the "temperature" variable so that this block returns "It's just right."

      NEW Course 4 Artist Params 1: Let's define this function to draw a square with 50 pixel sides. Click "edit" to get started.
      NEW Course 4 Artist Params 10: 'Create a `draw a hexagon` function block with a length parameter. This hexagon has sides that are 100 pixels in length. '
      NEW Course 4 Artist Params 11: Can you figure out how to draw this shape? Edit the function to use the "sides" parameter.
      NEW Course 4 Artist Params 12: Can you complete this drawing? The sides of all the shapes are 100 pixels long.
      NEW Course 4 Artist Params 12a: This image is similar to the last. Can you use a `for` loop with your function to make this design?
      NEW Course 4 Artist Params 13: "Let's edit this \"draw a polygon\" function. It already has a \"sides\" parameter. Now, let's add a \"length\" parameter. \nThe perimeter of each shape is 200 pixels long. Do you remember the equation to make shapes the same size when they have a different number of sides?"
      NEW Course 4 Artist Params 14: Edit "draw a spiral edge" to use "length" and "sides" parameters, then recreate these shapes.
      NEW Course 4 Artist Params 15: 'Freeplay: Here are the functions you''ve written, and some more for you to play with. Draw something awesome! Play with the pen width to see how different your drawings look!'
      NEW Course 4 Artist Params 2: Create a `draw triangle` function from scratch that makes a triangle with  50 pixel sides.
      NEW Course 4 Artist Params 3: 'Now let''s use the function to draw 5 triangles in a row. Each triangle is 30 pixels apart.

'
      NEW Course 4 Artist Params 4: Do you notice anything different about these function blocks? Click “Run” to see what happens.
      NEW Course 4 Artist Params 5: 'Replace the `???` in the `length` parameter input block. The pentagon has 100 pixel sides. '
      NEW Course 4 Artist Params 6: Fill in the "length" parameter to draw these shapes by replacing the "???" with the right numbers. The square and triangle have 100 pixels sides while each side of the hexagon is 75 pixels long.
      NEW Course 4 Artist Params 7: Can you complete this drawing? The sides of each triangle are 25 pixels larger than the last.  The first triangle has 25 pixel sides.
      NEW Course 4 Artist Params 8: The code for this triangle function is broken. Can you edit the function to fix it, and then make triangles of length 25, 50, and 75?
      NEW Course 4 Artist Params 9: 'Click "edit" to fill in the function definition of "draw a square" and add a parameter. It should take a length parameter, just like the triangle. This time, draw 3 squares: 25, 50 and 75 pixels in length, each 100 pixels apart.'
      NEW Course 4 Artist Params inspire: "Free Play Inspiration: You've now learned everything you need to know to make a pattern like this! If this picture inspires you, try to make something similar. Otherwise, create something all your own.\n \nWant to know how our inspiration pattern was made? "
      NEW Course 4 Artist Vars 1.5: 'Take a look at the code, can you see how the "set length" block and "length" block works together? Click on "Run" to see it in action. '
      NEW Course 4 Artist Vars 12: Now, recreate the algorithm from the last level and create a pentagon with sides of length 150.
      NEW Course 4 Artist Vars 2.5: 'Take a look at the code, can you see how the "set length" block and "length" block works together? Click on "Run" to see it in action. '
      NEW Course 4 Artist Vars 2: 'Drag a number block to both the `set length` block and the `repeat _ times` block to draw a set of 50 pixel triangles. '
      NEW Course 4 Artist Vars 4 5: Awesome job on the last puzzle, let's try it again this time let's make this cool design with with 60 pixel hexagon's.
      NEW Course 4 Artist Vars 4: "Let's try it again! \n\nCan you set the `length` variable to 60 to make this cool design with hexagons?"
      NEW Course 4 Artist Vars 6: "Draw this pattern of pentagons with 100 pixel sides by setting the right value for `length` and dropping the `length` variable into all of the the correct places. \n\nSee how you only have to set the value for `length` once, and the code uses the right value everywhere?"
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 1: Use a loop to collect the nectar from each flower.
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 10: Use your for loop "counter" variable to control how far to move horizontally.
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 10a: 'Ready for a challenge?  Take what you''ve learned about loops and try to solve this problem. Remember: You may have to run through solutions multiple times before you figure out all of the steps.'
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 11: Can you use the loop variable to control movement and nectar collection?
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 2: Add the code necessary to make sure the bee collects all the nectar. Look at how much code you need for this puzzle! (We'll learn a simpler way in the next puzzle.)
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 3: 'Ah, the "for loop" makes this much easier! All the code you need is here, take a look at how it is put together then click "Run" to see how it works. '
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 4 4: Now we need to move forward "counter" times, then get nectar "counter" times.  Can you use two "repeat" loops to solve this challenge?
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 4: 'Replace the ??? in the "for loop" with the largest amount of nectar the bee has to collect. '
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 5 5: Are you getting the hang of using the "for loop"? Let's help the bee get the rest of the nectar.
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 5: You can also use a "for loop" to count down. Try gathering this nectar by counting down from 5 to 1 by 1.
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 6: The last number in your for loop is called the "increment". Each time the loop is run, the counter variable changes by the value of the increment. Try collecting these flowers using an increment of 2.
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 7: |-
        Now, let's combine the "counter" variable with a math block! How can you use the "counter" variable to navigate this garden with the fewest number of blocks possible? What do you need to do to collect 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 nectar this time? The secret is in the "counter" variable!

        Remember: If your loop is counting up, the increment is added to your "counter" variable each time through.
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 8: You've got this! What should your increment be to collect 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 nectar?
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 9: If your loop is counting down, the increment is subtracted from your counter variable each loop. What should your increment be to collect 15, then 12, then 9, 6, 3 nectar?
      NEW Course 4 Bee For Loops 95: Take a look at each piece of the "for loop" that you have just created.  Can you figure out which numbers you need to double to solve this puzzle? Why does it work?
      NEW Course 4 Play Lab Params 11: 'It''s free play time! Have fun with all the blocks in your tool box. '
      NEW Course 4 Play Lab Params 5 5: Let's try that again, but with less help. What do you need to edit this time to make the actors patrol?
      NEW Course 4 Play Lab Vars 4 5: "“What do you think this code will do? Press “Run” to see what happens.”"
      NEW Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 7a: Using what you learned so far, can you have Dinosaur take a step forward every time Penguin counts?
      NEW Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 8 Free Play: 'It''s Free Play time, have fun with all the blocks in your tool box. '
      NEW Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 8a: 'Challenge: How would you use the "for loop" to get every actor to go around and say their actor number, then vanish from the screen? '
      NetSim Standalone Automatic DNS: In this version of the Internet Simulator, a Domain Name System (DNS) is provided for you and knows the IP addresses of all connected computers.

      PDAlg Updates Cond: When you went to PD in the summer, the Conditional block that you were introduced to was black and allowed any data type to be used. This proved to be confusing, given that every other function we've seen always produces the same type of data. To help make conditionals clearer and more consistent we've replaced the single black block with a separate block for each data type.
      PDAlg Updates Errors: Run the provided program and use the error messages to try and track down the bugs.

Click "Run" and then use the arrow keys to move Sam around his yard, making note of Sam's coordinates at different locations. Click "Finish" when you're ready to move on.
      Sam the Butterfly 2: Sam's mom wants to make sure that she can always see at least a bit of him, so lets write some functions that help make sure he doesn't go too far out of the yard. Here's a function called safe-left? - it should take a Number for its domain that represents Sam's x-coordinates and return true if he's completely visible on screen. If your function works, Sam shouldn't be able to leave the yard from the left side.
      Sam the Butterfly 3: In the last puzzle we kept Sam from leaving on the left, now let's do the same thing on the right. Complete the safe-right? function to make sure Sam can't go off the right side of the screen.
      Sam the Butterfly 4: Huh, we can keep Sam from leaving on the left, or we can keep him from leaving on the right, but how can we keep him safe from leaving both directions? Try using the and block to program the function on-screen? to check if Sam is safe-left? and safe-right?

      Standalone_Artist_4: Now you've got a new block to play with, the loop. This will repeat a set of commands. What happens if you loop these commands 6 times?
      Standalone_Artist_5.5: 'Notice how we simplified the diamond code by turning it into a loop. You can loop that whole sequence 12 times to draw the flower. Hint: You''ll need to turn 30 degrees after your diamond loop so you don''t keep drawing over the same diamond.'
      Standalone_Artist_5: How many times do you need to loop this diamond to draw the flower?
      Standalone_Artist_6: 'Loop this hexagon code 6 times to create the design. How many degrees will you need to turn each time? Hint: divide the number of degrees in a circle by the number of times you are looping.'

      U3L04 diamond solution: Study this solution to the drawDiamond problem.  Notice that the whole program starts by calling drawDiamond() at the top.  The program then follows a chain of function calls.  You can trace what's happening in the code to see the functions reused.  It's also easy to read because the function names describe the expected behavior.
