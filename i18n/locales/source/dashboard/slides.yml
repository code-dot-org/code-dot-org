#TODO: Wrap numeric keys in quotes & rectify translations on Crowdin.
# Why? Well...
# 1) Numeric keys in Yaml are loaded as Fixnums, not strings.
# 2) Rails' i18n can only look up string or symbol keys.
# 3) Crowdin proofreaders are translating filepaths, despite being hidden.

        text: "Now, if we put a \"move forward\" block above it and a \"repeat\" block around everything, each time the zombie moves, he'll check if there's a path to the left and turn. The \"repeat\" command is critical, to check for a turn at every step."
      6:
        image: 'notes/hoc4_6.jpg'
        text: "If statements are really important in computer science. One of the first programs I wrote was a tic-tac-toe game, and there was a If statement that said IF the other person is about to win, block the spot that lets them win."

Once you've learned these really basic moves, you learn new moves and put together these building blocks, like a pick and roll or give and go. You can then go from there to do more complex plays. Once you learn that play and give it a name, everybody on the team knows how to do it."

Similar to the way the internet breaks large messages down into packets, we use a concept called paging where we might only send your phone 100 contacts at a time and let your phone respond to us and ask for the next 100."
