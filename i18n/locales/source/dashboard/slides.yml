#TODO: Wrap numeric keys in quotes & rectify translations on Crowdin.
# Why? Well...
# 1) Numeric keys in Yaml are loaded as Fixnums, not strings.
# 2) Rails' i18n can only look up string or symbol keys.
# 3) Crowdin proofreaders are translating filepaths, despite being hidden.

        text: "Now, if we put a \"move forward\" block above it and a \"repeat\" block around everything, each time the zombie moves, he'll check if there's a path to the left and turn. The \"repeat\" command is critical, to check for a turn at every step."
      6:
        image: 'notes/hoc4_6.jpg'
        text: "If statements are really important in computer science. One of the first programs I wrote was a tic-tac-toe game, and there was a If statement that said IF the other person is about to win, block the spot that lets them win."
