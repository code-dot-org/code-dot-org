          description_audience: ''
          description_short: Learn to program with physical devices.
          description: Unit 6 explores the role of hardware platforms in computing and how different sensors can provide more effective input and output than the traditional keyboard, mouse, and monitor. Using App Lab and Adafruit’s Circuit Playground, you’ll develop programs that utilize the same hardware inputs and outputs that you see in the smart devices, looking at how a simple rough prototype can lead to a finished product. The unit concludes with a design challenge to use the Circuit Playground as the basis for an innovation of your own design.

          description_short: Learn how people use computers to solve data problems.
          description: Unit 5 is about the importance of data in solving problems and highlights how computers can help in this process. The first chapter explores different systems used to represent information in a computer and the challenges and tradeoffs posed by using them. In the second chapter you’ll learn how collections of data are used to solve problems, and how computers help to automate the steps of this process. The chapter concludes by considering how the data problem solving process can be applied to an area of the your choosing.

          description: Unit 6 explores the role of hardware platforms in computing and how different sensors can provide more effective input and output than the traditional keyboard, mouse, and monitor. Using App Lab and Adafruit’s Circuit Playground, you’ll develop programs that utilize the same hardware inputs and outputs that you see in the smart devices, looking at how a simple rough prototype can lead to a finished product. The unit concludes with a design challenge to use the Circuit Playground as the basis for an innovation of your own design.

          title: CSD Unit 6 - Physical Computing ('19-'20)
          description: Unit 6 explores the role of hardware platforms in computing and how different sensors can provide more effective input and output than the traditional keyboard, mouse, and monitor. Using App Lab and Adafruit’s Circuit Playground, you’ll develop programs that utilize the same hardware inputs and outputs that you see in the smart devices, looking at how a simple rough prototype can lead to a finished product. The unit concludes with a design challenge to use the Circuit Playground as the basis for an innovation of your own design.

          description: "Problem Solving and Computing is a highly interactive and collaborative introduction to the field of computer science, as framed within the broader pursuit of solving problems. You’ll practice using a problem solving process to address a series of puzzles, challenges, and real world scenarios. Next, you’ll learn how computers input, output, store, and process information to help humans solve problems.  The unit concludes with a project in which you design an application that helps solve a problem of your choosing. \n\n**Implementation Guidance for Unit 1**\n\n-   Unit 1 Chapter 1 should be completed before any other unit in CS Discoveries\n-   Alternate lessons are provided for some lessons in Unit 1, depending on your classroom context\n-   You can view the full [Curriculum Guide][0] and [Implementation Guide][1] for more information about this unit"

            Unit 6 explores the role of hardware platforms in computing and how different sensors can provide more effective input and output than the traditional keyboard, mouse, and monitor. Using App Lab and Adafruit’s Circuit Playground, you’ll develop programs that utilize the same hardware inputs and outputs that you see in the smart devices, looking at how a simple rough prototype can lead to a finished product. The unit concludes with a design challenge to use the Circuit Playground as the basis for an innovation of your own design.

                * What kind of information can be communicated with simple hardware outputs?
              description: This unit begins with an activity that encourages students to explore a wide variety of non-traditional computing platforms, before kicking off a review of programming in App Lab, with a particular focus on better understanding the event-driven programming model that was first introduced in Unit 4. Students learn techniques to make the apps they write more flexible by modifying design elements through code instead of always relying on design mode. Using the Circuit Playground, they then explore different approaches to taking input and producing output using hardware. By the end of this chapter, students will design a develop a game that uses physical hardware for input and output.

              description: With an understanding of how to use hardware to take input and produce output, students move to thinking about more complex programs that integrate hardware and software. Using the color LEDs as an example of a a group of like objects, students learn how to use arrays to keep track of lists of values. From there we introduce the for loop, first simply as a way to repeat a block of code, and then as a way to run code on each element of an array. By the end of this chapter students will have explored all components of their boards while learning to structure their code using arrays, loops, and parametric functions. In the final two lessons students have an opportunity to dig into building physical prototypes using their boards.

A major focus of the unit is building a positive classroom culture in which students work together, explore problems, and communicate about their thinking. Most lessons either feature physical manipulatives or a digital widget, and the bulk of lesson time should be spent with students exploring these tools together to develop an understanding of the concepts they highlight. The course intentionally does not start with programming since, in many classrooms, some students have experience with programming and others do not. Choosing to begin with digital information and the internet lets you build community in the room while exploring a topic that is likely to be accessible to all students. The supportive and inclusive classroom environment built in this unit should help set a positive tone that can be carried through the school year.\n\n\n* **Empowering \"Deciders\":**  An important goal of the course is not merely to teach students technical knowledge, but to put those skills to work in meaningful ways. This unit builds towards the unit project, which provides an opportunity for students to be \"deciders\" about the impacts of computing on modern life. Other units will emphasize empowering units as \"creators.\"\n\n### Major Assessment and Projects\n\nThe unit project asks students to consider and debate issues that arise in modern society due to the digitizing of information. Students will analyze an article that addresses the intersection of digitizing information and current events. They will evaluate what data is being digitized and evaluate the benefits and harms caused by making this information digital. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n\n### AP Connections\n\nThis unit and its associated project help build towards the enduring understandings listed below. For a detailed mapping of units to Learning Objectives and EKs, please see the \"Standards\" page for this unit.\n\n* DAT-1: The way a computer represents data internally is different from the way the data is interpreted and displayed for the user.

It is designed to maintain the collaborative and inclusive classroom environment developed in the previous two units. The collaborative project, fun, unplugged activities, and the focus on experimenting should help keep your whole class working together and trying out ideas. \n\n* **Emphasizing Skills:** Since this is the first of many programming units, it emphasizes attitudes and skills that will serve your students well for the remainder of the year. The project that runs through this unit emphasizes that programming is a creative and collaborative endeavor that students can use to help others. Key practices like pair programming and debugging help normalize working with a partner, asking for help, and making mistakes. While students have a lot to learn about programming and App Lab, there is just as much emphasis on establishing these positive habits and mindsets. \n\n* **Empowering \"Creators\":** This unit empowers students to be creators with a major emphasis on making personally meaningful apps. Students have a lot to learn about programming. Still, the goal is for students to come away from this unit, seeing programming as a powerful form of personal expression that allows them to draw on their innate talents and interests to help solve problems in their community.\n\n### Major Assessment and Projects\n\nThe unit project asks students to collaborate with a classmate to design an app that can teach others about a topic of shared interest. Students practice interviewing classmates to identify the project's goals, mockup designs, collaboratively program the app and run simple user tests. The app itself must include at least three screens and demonstrate what students have learned about user interface design and event-driven programming. Students submit their app, project guide, and written responses to reflection questions about how the app is designed and the development process used to make it. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n\n### AP Connections\n\nThis unit and unit project helps build towards the enduring understandings listed below. For a detailed mapping of units to Learning Objectives and EKs, please see the \"Standards\" page for this unit.\n\n* CRD-1: incorporating multiple perspectives through collaboration improves computing innovations as they are developed.\n* CRD-2: developers create and innovate using an iterative design process that is user-focused, that incorporates implementation/feedback cycles, and that leaves ample room for experimentation and risk-taking.\n* AAP-2: The way statements are sequenced and combined in a program determines the computed result. Programs incorporate iteration and selection constructs to represent repetition and make decisions to handle varied input values.\n* AAP-3: Programmers break down problems into smaller and more manageable pieces. By creating procedures and leveraging parameters, programmers generalize processes that can be reused. Procedures allow programmers to draw upon existing code that has already been tested, allowing them to write programs more quickly and with more confidence.\n\nThis unit includes content from the following topics from the AP CS Principles Framework.

              description: "### Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy\n\n\n* **Intro to EIPM:** This unit is students' first experience with the Explore, Investigate, Practice, Make lesson sequence, or EIPM. This structured approach to teaching programming is covered in detail in the curriculum guide. We highly recommend watching the [accompanying video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNeqEl6MN7c2KyM3gdBSo8t3) to better understand what EIPM should look like in the classroom. When used effectively, it supports deep learning of content and helps maintain a collaborative classroom culture, even as you move into more complex programming concepts.\n\n* **Scaffolding Towards Independent Projects:** A major goal of this course is to empower students to design and build projects independently. The Create PT in Unit 8 offers students enormous freedom to scope and build projects, and even this unit begins scaffolding towards that goal. Individual EIPM sequences of lessons gradually prepare students for scoped, independent Make projects. The unit project has a few requirements, but students are largely free to choose the design, topic, and implementation of their ideas. As you teach the unit, look for the opportunities to scaffold the skills and knowledge students will need to creatively and independently tackle the unit project.\n\n\n### Major Assessment and Projects\n\nThe unit project asks students to design an app that makes a recommendation based on information from user input. Students are given a great deal of freedom to choose their topic, design their user interface, and decide how to actually program their app's behavior.

              description: "### Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy\n\n* **Independent Creation and The Hackathon Project:** Much like the project in Unit 4, the \"Hackathon\" project in this unit is designed as an opportunity for students to creatively and independently build something with their programming skills. While students are asked to include some technical requirements in their program to ensure they demonstrate mastery of new programming concepts, they have free rein to choose the goals, design, and implementation of their project. To avoid asking students to complete a major programming project right before the Create PT, this hackathon is the most \"Create-PT-like\" project of the course. It is the best chance for students to practice skills like budgeting time or scoping an open-ended project. In many classrooms, if you maintain the recommended pacing of the course, this project serves as an excellent end to the first semester.\n\n* **Growing Comfort with EIPM:** By Unit 5, students (and teachers!) should be developing greater comfort with the flow of EIPM lessons. Students may begin to anticipate that sequences build towards an independent Make lesson or look forward to stepping away from computers to Explore. A nice feature of EIPM is that you will find strategies and modifications to each lesson type that work best for your students. Keep an eye out for how you and your students are developing comfort with EIPM and note strategies that help meet your classroom's needs.\n\n* **Programming with Real-world Data:** The Data Library is a new feature in App Lab for the 2020-21 school year and was designed to let students program with data from the real world. This tool aims to motivate students to build new kinds of data-powered apps that they find personally interesting. This tool also facilitates programming with lists of information since students will need to manipulate lists of data to incorporate the different data sources. Encourage students to use datasets they find personally relevant as they draw on their creative ideas for bringing data to life.\n\n\n\n### Major Assessment and Projects\n\nThe unit project asks students to spend five days as part of a \"Hackathon\" project that they have nearly complete independence to scope and design. Students must choose one dataset from the Data Library in AppLab to be a component of their project to demonstrate what they have learned about lists and list processing; otherwise, scoping the project is completely up to them. Students submit their app, project guide, and written responses to reflection questions about how the app is designed and the development process they used to make it. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n\n### AP Connections\n\nThis unit and unit project helps build towards the enduring understandings listed below.

This tool allows them to build and share libraries of functions that they can use in many different projects. This tool serves many purposes besides simply teaching students about libraries. By having to write functions that other students find useful, they will need to think about common patterns or situations that they have seen in projects across the course. Students will also practice commenting their code so others can understand how it works, practice designing functions that use parameters and return.  \n\n* **Final Preparation for the Create PT:** Students learn very few new concepts in this unit; nevertheless, it can be challenging because students need to learn how to integrate the ideas of parameters and return with every other concept they have learned in this course. This unit presents a good opportunity to do a final review of every programming construct covered in the course as students prepare to demonstrate what they've learned on the Create PT.\n\n### Major Assessment and Projects\n\nThe unit project asks students to design a library of functions that they can share with classmates. Their library must contain at least two functions, and at least one of those functions must include a parameter, return, a loop, and an if-statement. This requirement ensures students practice skills they willll use in the Create PT. Using a project guide, students choose a theme for their library, build it, test it, and exchange feedback with other students. Students submit their library code, project guide, and written responses to reflection questions about how the app is designed and the development process they used to make it. They will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n\n### AP Connections\n\nThis unit and unit project helps build towards the enduring understandings listed below.

Some lessons are designed around different steps of this process, like cleaning data or building visualizations. Other lessons focus on ways this process is applied in real-world contexts like citizen science or machine learning. The data analysis process helps provide a consistent reference point as students explore the importance of data analysis in computing. \n\n* **Exploring Data with the Data Visualizer:** The Data Visualizer is a tool built into App Lab that allows students to quickly create visualizations of the data they've added to their projects. The set of possible visualizations is intentionally limited to a few ways to change or modify the chart. This tool aims to encourage exploring the different kinds of questions that can be answered with data visualizations, with a greater emphasis on students' ability to create a variety of visualizations quickly.\n\n\n### Major Assessment and Projects\n\nStudents use the data visualizer to find and present a data story. Using what they've learned about the data analysis process, students either choose a dataset inside the data library or upload one of their own and create visualizations that find interesting patterns that may reveal new insights and knowledge. Students complete an activity guide describing their findings and the process they used in identifying them.

              description: "### Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy\n\n* **Learning Through Full-class Simulation:** The simulation project that runs through this unit serves several important goals. It helps contextualize what students are learning by moving from abstract ideas of privacy or security to concrete potential innovations. Since the simulation is based on modernizing schools, students can consider the consequences of computing innovations in a familiar setting. By taking on an assigned role and interacting with a group of teammates who have done the same, students must consider a breadth of interests and goals beyond their own when it comes to innovating in schools. \n\n* **Ending the Year as \"Deciders\":** A major theme students engage with throughout this unit is the need to consider both sides of technological innovation. Computing technology has led to both benefits and harms to culture, economy, and society at large. Responding to important questions facing our world requires understanding technology and an ability to identify and interpret the impacts it causes. This unit is not designed to advocate for any particular point of view on the impact of technology. Still, it should empower students to adeptly see and weigh the consequences of the technology around them. While the Create PT may feel like the most significant project of this course, the Explore Curricular requirement and the questions faced in this unit are arguably more crucial. Many of the young people who take CS Principles may pursue studies or careers in which they are \"creators\" with technology, but all of them will need to be thoughtful \"deciders\" in a world profoundly shaped by computing. \n\n\n### Major Assessment and Projects\n\nStudents complete the Future School Convention simulation throughout this unit. Working in teams of roughly five people, students are assigned a role and a set of interests they'll need to investigate. They research real-world innovations that could improve schools and align with the interests of their character. Throughout the unit, they are given opportunities to refine their proposals as a team and debate the benefits and risks of different computing innovations. Eventually, their team submits an overall proposal for the Future School, and all students vote for the team and innovation they believe to be the best. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with the CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n\n### AP Connections\n\nThis unit and unit project helps build towards the enduring understandings listed below. For a detailed mapping of units to Learning Objectives and EKs please see the \"Standards\" page for this unit.\n\n* IOC-1: While computing innovations are typically designed to achieve a specific purpose, they may have unintended consequences.\n* IOC-2: The use of computing innovations may involve risks to your personal safety and identity.\n\nThis unit includes content from the following topics from the AP CS Principles Framework. For more detailed information on topic coverage in the course review [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dqYF5u0AULjw049gaCwAP34ZSe0VuEWbAjWoH1-YMW0/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n* 5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects\n* 5.6 Safe Computing"

          student_description: Unit 5 is about the importance of data in solving problems and highlights how computers can help in this process. The first chapter explores different systems used to represent information in a computer and the challenges and tradeoffs posed by using them. In the second chapter you’ll learn how collections of data are used to solve problems, and how computers help to automate the steps of this process. The chapter concludes by considering how the data problem solving process can be applied to an area of your choosing.

          description: "I get the error only when trying to add this markdown chunk.\n\n### Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy\n\n-   **Intro to EIPM:** This unit is students' first experience with the Explore, Investigate, Practice, Make lesson sequence, or EIPM. This structured approach to teaching programming is covered in detail in the curriculum guide and we highly recommend that you watch the [accompanying video series][0] to better understand what EIPM should look like in the classroom. When used effectively, it supports deep learning of content and helps maintain a collaborative classroom culture, even as you move into more complex programming concepts.\n-   **Scaffolding Towards Independent Projects:** A major goal of this course is to empower students to design and build projects independently. The Create PT in Unit 8 offers students enormous freedoms to scope and build projects, and even this unit begins scaffolding towards that goal. Individual EIPM sequences of lessons gradually prepare students for scoped, independent Make projects. The unit project has a few requirements, but students are largely free to choose the design, topic, and implementation of their ideas. As you teach the unit, look for the opportunities to scaffold the skills and knowledge students will need to creatively and independently tackle the unit project.\n    ### Major Assessment and Projects\n    The unit project asks students to design an app that makes a recommendation based on input information from the user. Students are given a great deal of freedom to choose their topic, design their user interface, and decide how to actually program their app's behavior. Students submit their app, project guide, and written responses to reflection questions about how the app is designed and the development process they used to make it. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n    ### AP Connections\n    This unit and unit project helps build towards the enduring understandings listed below. For a detailed mapping of units to Learning Objectives and EKs please see the \"Standards\" page for this unit.\n-   CRD-2: Developers create and innovate using an iterative design process that is user-focused, that incorporates implementation/feedback cycles, and that leaves ample room for experimentation and risk-taking.\n-   AAP-1: To find specific solutions to generalizable problems, programmers represent and organize data in multiple ways.\n-   AAP-2: The way statements are sequenced and combined in a program determines the computed result. Programs incorporate iteration and selection constructs to represent repetition and make decisions to handle varied input values.\n-   AAP-3: Programmers break down problems into smaller and more manageable pieces. By creating procedures and leveraging parameters, programmers generalize processes that can be reused. Procedures allow programmers to draw upon existing code that has already been tested, allowing them to write programs more quickly and with more confidence.\n    This unit includes content from the following topics from the AP CS Principles Framework. For more detailed information on topic coverage in the course review [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage][1].\n-   1.4 Identifying and Correcting Errors\n-   3.1 Variables and Assignment\n-   3.3 Mathematical Expressions\n-   3.5 Boolean Expressions\n-   3.6 Conditionals\n-   3.7 Nested Conditionals\n-   3.15 Random Values\n    The College Board has supplied formative Create PT questions to help prepare students to complete the Create Task. We recommend that students complete the following prompts with the unit project. More information can be found in Code.org CS Principles Topic Coverage.\n-   3.a.i.\n-   3.a.ii.\n-   3.a.iii"

          description_audience: ''
          description_short: ''
          description: In this unit, students learn how the use of APIs and libraries can expand the functionalities of their programs. Students learn to use relational and logical operators to expand the decisions for conditionals and iteration. Students use casting operators and `Math` class methods as they evaluate expressions and perform calculations, including implementing random in program decisions and behaviors. While working with compound Boolean expressions and logical operators, students develop an understanding of De Morgan's Laws and writing truth tables. Students use these expanded conditions and expressions to evaluate primitive values and object references and make decisions based on the results.

          description: "**Overview:** \nIn this module, students will create a Poem Bot that recites different versions of a haiku poem they write. First, students will study the structure and elements of a haiku poem by reading poems together, decomposing a haiku poem into its parts, and writing a haiku. Then, students will learn how computers can take in user input and store it in its memory and will build a Poem Bot. Once they’ve built their Poem Bot, they will test their programs with their classmates and complete the project by sharing their user-generated poems in a poetry circle."

While creating and working with objects, students use the `Scanner` class to obtain user input to use as program data, learn about data types, operators, and expressions to store and manipulate data in variables, and develop an understanding of data encapsulation and object-oriented design decisions.\n\n### AP Classroom Personal Progress Checks\n\nTo assign questions from the AP Classroom Question Bank that align with this unit, create a custom quiz in AP Classroom by searching the Question Bank for the Essential Knowledge statements on the unit's [**Standards**][0] page.

          title: Expanding Program Logic
          description: "In this unit, students learn how the use of APIs and libraries can expand the functionalities of their programs. Students learn to use relational and logical operators to expand the decisions for conditionals and iteration. Students use casting operators and `Math` class methods as they evaluate expressions and perform calculations, including implementing random in program decisions and behaviors. While working with compound Boolean expressions and logical operators, students develop an understanding of De Morgan's Laws and writing truth tables. Students use these expanded conditions and expressions to evaluate primitive values and object references and make decisions based on the results.\n\n### AP Classroom Personal Progress Checks\n\nTo assign questions from the AP Classroom Question Bank that align with this unit, create a custom quiz in AP Classroom by searching the Question Bank for the Essential Knowledge statements on the unit's [**Standards**][0] page.

          description: "In this unit, students use `ArrayList`s to store program data and differentiate between when to use 1D and 2D arrays and `ArrayList`s. Students explore the benefits and functionality of an `ArrayList`, using these to solve problems involving numerical and object data. Students use methods in the `String` class to analyze and process text obtained from user and file input. Throughout the unit, students write program documentation using single-line comments, multi-line comments, and Javadoc comments to create API documentation. In the process, students identify and document preconditions and postconditions of objects and methods.\n\n### AP Classroom Personal Progress Checks\n\nTo assign questions from the AP Classroom Question Bank that align with this unit, create a custom quiz in AP Classroom by searching the Question Bank for the Essential Knowledge statements on the unit's [**Standards**][0] page. You can find instructions and video demonstrations to do this on [**AP Central**][1].\n\nThe following Personal Progress Checks in AP Classroom can be assigned during the Show What You Know week:\n\n-   Personal Progress Check 2\n-   Personal Progress Check 7\n\n**_Note:_** _Some Learning Objectives and Essential Knowledge statements in the suggested Personal Progress Checks are covered in later units._"

Students use one-dimensional (1D) arrays to represent lists of data while expanding their knowledge of loops and conditionals to analyze and process data in a 1D array. Students learn to use `for` loops to traverse arrays and discover that an algorithm involving loops can be implemented with either a `for` loop or a `while` loop. Throughout the unit, students develop and modify standard algorithms to find and manipulate elements in a 1D array while also discovering the concept of polymorphism when traversing arrays of objects. As part of the planning process, students identify the preconditions and postconditions that an algorithm must satisfy.

          title: 'Expanding Software Design '
          description: In this unit, students practice software design and development using the skills and programming constructs they have learned to develop a title sequence for their favorite content creator. Students use decomposition strategies and object-oriented principles to plan and implement their ideas while ensuring their projects meet specified requirements. Students explore recursive methods by tracing and writing recursive methods and comparing recursive and iterative solutions for efficiency. At the end of the unit, students consider the need for maximizing system reliability as they explore bugs and issues in existing programs.

          description: "We created Course F for students in the fifth grade. The course begins by looking at how users make choices in the apps they use. Students then learn to make a variety of Sprite Lab apps that also offer choices for the user. In the later lessons in the course, students will learn about variables in a variety of contexts. Students are given greater autonomy and more choices throughout this course. By the end of the course, students will have created interactive projects to share with their friends and family.\n\n## Spring 2022 Open Preview\n\nThis new version of Course F includes three new lessons, and we need your feedback! The new lessons are:\n\n-   Lesson 9 - Lots of Sprites - [give feedback][0]\n-   Lesson 10 - Counting with Variables - [give feedback][1]\n-   Lesson 11 - Mini-Project: Collector Game - [give feedback][2]\n\nPlease note that these new lessons may change between now and July 2022. We appreciate any feedback. Courses A-E of CS Fundamentals (2022) will launch in July 2022.\n\nWe have also added a full slide deck covering all lessons in Course F. We welcome your [feedback][3] on the lesson slides as well!"

          title: ArrayLists and String Methods ('22-'23)
          description: "This unit continues to expand on data structures to introduce students to creating lists using the `ArrayList` class. In the process, students learn about the `Integer` and `Double` classes and use their methods to parse data from text files and explore the limits of integer values. Students differentiate between when to use each type of data structure while learning about the structure and functionality of an `ArrayList`. Students apply standard algorithms to find and manipulate data in an `ArrayList` of numerical and object data. Throughout the unit, students learn to use the `String` class to analyze and process text obtained from a user and from file input while learning about basic natural language processing techniques and applications. Additionally, students further develop software engineering skills by writing Javadoc comments to create API documentation for their programs.\n\n### AP Classroom Personal Progress Checks\n\nTo assign questions from the AP Classroom Question Bank that align with this unit, create a custom quiz in AP Classroom by searching the Question Bank for the Essential Knowledge statements on the unit's [**Standards**][0] page. You can find instructions and video demonstrations to do this on [**AP Central**][1].\n\nThe following Personal Progress Checks in AP Classroom can be assigned during the Show What You Know week:\n\n-   Personal Progress Check 2\n-   Personal Progress Check 7\n\n**_Note:_** _Some Learning Objectives and Essential Knowledge statements in the suggested Personal Progress Checks are covered in later units._"

Additionally, you further develop software engineering skills by writing Javadoc comments to create API documentation for your programs.
          description_short: Students use ArrayLists to store program data and work with methods in the String class to manipulate and evaluate String objects.

          description: "This unit allows students to practice software design and development using the skills they have learned throughout the curriculum while planning and developing a creative coding project to convey a personal interest or story using The Theater. Students use decomposition strategies and object-oriented principles to plan and implement their ideas while ensuring their projects meet specified requirements. In the process, students learn to write `private`, overloaded, and overridden methods and use the `super` keyword in a subclass method to call a superclass method while exploring the functionality of methods and their parameters. Throughout the unit, students practice tracing and writing recursive methods and comparing these methods to iterative solutions. With the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the year, students consider the need for maximizing system reliability as they explore bugs and issues in existing programs.\n\n### AP Classroom Personal Progress Checks\n\nTo assign questions from the AP Classroom Question Bank that align with this unit, create a custom quiz in AP Classroom by searching the Question Bank for the Essential Knowledge statements on the unit's [**Standards**][0] page.

            In Web Development, students are empowered to create and share content on their own web pages. They begin by thinking about the role of the web and how it can be used as a medium for creative expression. As students develop their pages and begin to see themselves as programmers, they are encouraged to think critically about the impact of sharing information online and how to be more critical consumers of content. They are also introduced to problem solving as it relates to programming while they learn valuable skills such as debugging, using resources, and teamwork. At the conclusion of the unit, students will have created a personal website they can publish and share.

            In the Interactive Animations and Games unit, students create programmatic images, animations, interactive art, and games. Starting off with simple, primitive shapes and building up to more sophisticated sprite-based games, students become familiar with the programming concepts and the design process computer scientists use daily. They then learn how these simpler constructs can be combined to create more complex programs. In the final project, students develop a personalized, interactive program.

            The Design Process unit transitions students from thinking about computer science as a tool to solve their own problems towards considering the broader social impacts of computing. Through a series of design challenges, students are asked to consider and understand the needs of others while developing a solution to a problem. The second half of the unit consists of an iterative team project, during which students have the opportunity to identify a need that they care about, prototype solutions both on paper and in App Lab, and test their solutions with real users to get feedback and drive further iteration.
