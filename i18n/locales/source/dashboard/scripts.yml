            If you're not a code.org engineer but managed to discover this unit: congratulations! It's like you discovered a secret on our website! But if you're looking for more info about our curricula or tools, we recommend checking out [https://code.org/educate/][0] instead.

            If you are a code.org engineer: this script contains all the level types for UI testing. Please sign in to test applab levels (By design, applab levels only work if signed in. Normally, we make people sign in, but this is only enforceable for a whole script and would be annoying to do for this script).

            If you are a code.org engineer: this script contains all the level types for UI testing. Please sign in to test applab levels (By design, applab levels only work if signed in. Normally, we make people sign in, but this is only enforceable for a whole script and would be annoying to do for this script).

          student_description: " In Unit 3, you’ll build on your coding experience as you program animations, interactive art, and games in Game Lab. The unit starts off with simple shapes and builds up to more sophisticated sprite-based games, using the same programming concepts and the design process computer scientists use daily. In the final project, you’ll develop a personalized, interactive program."

A major focus of the unit is building a positive classroom culture in which students work together, explore problems, and communicate about their thinking. Most lessons either feature physical manipulatives or a digital widget, and the bulk of lesson time should be spent with students exploring these tools together to develop an understanding of the concepts they highlight. The course intentionally does not start with programming since, in many classrooms, some students have experience with programming and others do not. Choosing to begin with digital information and the internet lets you build community in the room while exploring a topic that is likely to be accessible to all students. The supportive and inclusive classroom environment built in this unit should help set a positive tone that can be carried through the school year.\n\n\n* **Empowering \"Deciders\":**  An important goal of the course is not merely to teach students technical knowledge, but to put those skills to work in meaningful ways. This unit builds towards the unit project, which provides an opportunity for students to be \"deciders\" about the impacts of computing on modern life. Other units will emphasize empowering units as \"creators.\"\n\n### Major Assessment and Projects\n\nThe unit project asks students to consider and debate issues that arise in modern society due to the digitizing of information. Students will analyze an article that addresses the intersection of digitizing information and current events. They will evaluate what data is being digitized and evaluate the benefits and harms caused by making this information digital. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n\n### AP Connections\n\nThis unit and its associated project help build towards the enduring understandings listed below. For a detailed mapping of units to Learning Objectives and EKs, please see the \"Standards\" page for this unit.\n\n* DAT-1: The way a computer represents data internally is different from the way the data is interpreted and displayed for the user. Programs are used to translate data into a representation more easily understood by people.\n* IOC-1: while computing innovations are typically designed to achieve a specific purpose, they may have unintended consequences\n\nThis unit includes content from the following topics from the AP CS Principles Framework. For more detailed information on topic coverage in the course review [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dqYF5u0AULjw049gaCwAP34ZSe0VuEWbAjWoH1-YMW0/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n* 2.1 Binary Numbers\n* 2.2 Data Compression\n* 5.5 Legal and Ethical Concerns."

As students move from lesson to lesson, the version of the Internet Simulator they use will have slightly more functionality than the last. Lessons will present students with challenges that closely mimic those that the internet's original inventors needed to solve.

              description: "### Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy\n\n\n* **New Topics, Same Classroom Culture:** This unit is students' first experience with programming. It is designed to maintain the collaborative and inclusive classroom environment developed in the previous two units. The collaborative project, fun, unplugged activities, and the focus on experimenting should help keep your whole class working together and trying out ideas. \n\n* **Emphasizing Skills:** Since this is the first of many programming units, it emphasizes attitudes and skills that will serve your students well for the remainder of the year. The project that runs through this unit emphasizes that programming is a creative and collaborative endeavor that students can use to help others. Key practices like pair programming and debugging help normalize working with a partner, asking for help, and making mistakes. While students have a lot to learn about programming and App Lab, there is just as much emphasis on establishing these positive habits and mindsets. \n\n* **Empowering \"Creators\":** This unit empowers students to be creators with a major emphasis on making personally meaningful apps. Students have a lot to learn about programming. Still, the goal is for students to come away from this unit, seeing programming as a powerful form of personal expression that allows them to draw on their innate talents and interests to help solve problems in their community.\n\n### Major Assessment and Projects\n\nThe unit project asks students to collaborate with a classmate to design an app that can teach others about a topic of shared interest. Students practice interviewing classmates to identify the project's goals, mockup designs, collaboratively program the app and run simple user tests. The app itself must include at least three screens and demonstrate what students have learned about user interface design and event-driven programming. Students submit their app, project guide, and written responses to reflection questions about how the app is designed and the development process used to make it. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n\n### AP Connections\n\nThis unit and unit project helps build towards the enduring understandings listed below. For a detailed mapping of units to Learning Objectives and EKs, please see the \"Standards\" page for this unit.\n\n* CRD-1: incorporating multiple perspectives through collaboration improves computing innovations as they are developed.\n* CRD-2: developers create and innovate using an iterative design process that is user-focused, that incorporates implementation/feedback cycles, and that leaves ample room for experimentation and risk-taking.\n* AAP-2: The way statements are sequenced and combined in a program determines the computed result. Programs incorporate iteration and selection constructs to represent repetition and make decisions to handle varied input values.\n* AAP-3: Programmers break down problems into smaller and more manageable pieces. By creating procedures and leveraging parameters, programmers generalize processes that can be reused. Procedures allow programmers to draw upon existing code that has already been tested, allowing them to write programs more quickly and with more confidence.\n\nThis unit includes content from the following topics from the AP CS Principles Framework.

              description: "### Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy\n\n\n* **Intro to EIPM:** This unit is students' first experience with the Explore, Investigate, Practice, Make lesson sequence, or EIPM. This structured approach to teaching programming is covered in detail in the curriculum guide. We highly recommend watching the [accompanying video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNeqEl6MN7c2KyM3gdBSo8t3) to better understand what EIPM should look like in the classroom. When used effectively, it supports deep learning of content and helps maintain a collaborative classroom culture, even as you move into more complex programming concepts.\n\n* **Scaffolding Towards Independent Projects:** A major goal of this course is to empower students to design and build projects independently. The Create PT in Unit 8 offers students enormous freedom to scope and build projects, and even this unit begins scaffolding towards that goal. Individual EIPM sequences of lessons gradually prepare students for scoped, independent Make projects. The unit project has a few requirements, but students are largely free to choose the design, topic, and implementation of their ideas. As you teach the unit, look for the opportunities to scaffold the skills and knowledge students will need to creatively and independently tackle the unit project.\n\n\n### Major Assessment and Projects\n\nThe unit project asks students to design an app that makes a recommendation based on information from user input. Students are given a great deal of freedom to choose their topic, design their user interface, and decide how to actually program their app's behavior. Students submit their app, project guide, and written responses to reflection questions about how the app is designed and the development process they used to make it. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n\n### AP Connections\n\nThis unit and unit project helps build towards the enduring understandings listed below.

              description: "### Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy\n\n* **Independent Creation and The Hackathon Project:** Much like the project in Unit 4, the \"Hackathon\" project in this unit is designed as an opportunity for students to creatively and independently build something with their programming skills. While students are asked to include some technical requirements in their program to ensure they demonstrate mastery of new programming concepts, they have free rein to choose the goals, design, and implementation of their project. To avoid asking students to complete a major programming project right before the Create PT, this hackathon is the most \"Create-PT-like\" project of the course. It is the best chance for students to practice skills like budgeting time or scoping an open-ended project. In many classrooms, if you maintain the recommended pacing of the course, this project serves as an excellent end to the first semester.\n\n* **Growing Comfort with EIPM:** By Unit 5, students (and teachers!) should be developing greater comfort with the flow of EIPM lessons. Students may begin to anticipate that sequences build towards an independent Make lesson or look forward to stepping away from computers to Explore. A nice feature of EIPM is that you will find strategies and modifications to each lesson type that work best for your students. Keep an eye out for how you and your students are developing comfort with EIPM and note strategies that help meet your classroom's needs.\n\n* **Programming with Real-world Data:** The Data Library is a new feature in App Lab for the 2020-21 school year and was designed to let students program with data from the real world. This tool aims to motivate students to build new kinds of data-powered apps that they find personally interesting. This tool also facilitates programming with lists of information since students will need to manipulate lists of data to incorporate the different data sources. Encourage students to use datasets they find personally relevant as they draw on their creative ideas for bringing data to life.\n\n\n\n### Major Assessment and Projects\n\nThe unit project asks students to spend five days as part of a \"Hackathon\" project that they have nearly complete independence to scope and design. Students must choose one dataset from the Data Library in AppLab to be a component of their project to demonstrate what they have learned about lists and list processing; otherwise, scoping the project is completely up to them. Students submit their app, project guide, and written responses to reflection questions about how the app is designed and the development process they used to make it.

After three units and a major hackathon project, it is a great opportunity to get away from screens for a while before the final programming push that leads to the Create PT.\n\n* **Just Enough Math:** This unit includes some mathematical concepts which enrich students' understanding of how algorithms are analyzed, which might at first be a little intimidating to some students (and teachers!). The mathematical topics included in this unit are only those necessary to provide a solid foundation in algorithmic analysis to the depth described in the CS Principles framework. If you are a teacher with a strong mathematical background, check carefully that you do not needlessly add complexity to a unit that might already prove challenging for some students. All teachers should keep an eye out for the ways visuals, hands-on examples, and patterns in presentation style are used to ensure a consistent presentation of these mathematical topics.\n\n\n### Major Assessment and Projects\n\nThis unit does not conclude with a major project.

This tool allows them to build and share libraries of functions that they can use in many different projects. This tool serves many purposes besides simply teaching students about libraries. By having to write functions that other students find useful, they will need to think about common patterns or situations that they have seen in projects across the course. Students will also practice commenting their code so others can understand how it works, practice designing functions that use parameters and return.  \n\n* **Final Preparation for the Create PT:** Students learn very few new concepts in this unit; nevertheless, it can be challenging because students need to learn how to integrate the ideas of parameters and return with every other concept they have learned in this course. This unit presents a good opportunity to do a final review of every programming construct covered in the course as students prepare to demonstrate what they've learned on the Create PT.\n\n### Major Assessment and Projects\n\nThe unit project asks students to design a library of functions that they can share with classmates. Their library must contain at least two functions, and at least one of those functions must include a parameter, return, a loop, and an if-statement. This requirement ensures students practice skills they willll use in the Create PT. Using a project guide, students choose a theme for their library, build it, test it, and exchange feedback with other students.

              description: "### Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy\n\n* **Learning Through Full-class Simulation:** The simulation project that runs through this unit serves several important goals. It helps contextualize what students are learning by moving from abstract ideas of privacy or security to concrete potential innovations. Since the simulation is based on modernizing schools, students can consider the consequences of computing innovations in a familiar setting. By taking on an assigned role and interacting with a group of teammates who have done the same, students must consider a breadth of interests and goals beyond their own when it comes to innovating in schools. \n\n* **Ending the Year as \"Deciders\":** A major theme students engage with throughout this unit is the need to consider both sides of technological innovation. Computing technology has led to both benefits and harms to culture, economy, and society at large. Responding to important questions facing our world requires understanding technology and an ability to identify and interpret the impacts it causes. This unit is not designed to advocate for any particular point of view on the impact of technology. Still, it should empower students to adeptly see and weigh the consequences of the technology around them. While the Create PT may feel like the most significant project of this course, the Explore Curricular requirement and the questions faced in this unit are arguably more crucial. Many of the young people who take CS Principles may pursue studies or careers in which they are \"creators\" with technology, but all of them will need to be thoughtful \"deciders\" in a world profoundly shaped by computing. \n\n\n### Major Assessment and Projects\n\nStudents complete the Future School Convention simulation throughout this unit. Working in teams of roughly five people, students are assigned a role and a set of interests they'll need to investigate. They research real-world innovations that could improve schools and align with the interests of their character. Throughout the unit, they are given opportunities to refine their proposals as a team and debate the benefits and risks of different computing innovations. Eventually, their team submits an overall proposal for the Future School, and all students vote for the team and innovation they believe to be the best. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with the CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n\n### AP Connections\n\nThis unit and unit project helps build towards the enduring understandings listed below. For a detailed mapping of units to Learning Objectives and EKs please see the \"Standards\" page for this unit.\n\n* IOC-1: While computing innovations are typically designed to achieve a specific purpose, they may have unintended consequences.\n* IOC-2: The use of computing innovations may involve risks to your personal safety and identity.\n\nThis unit includes content from the following topics from the AP CS Principles Framework. For more detailed information on topic coverage in the course review [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dqYF5u0AULjw049gaCwAP34ZSe0VuEWbAjWoH1-YMW0/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n* 5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects\n* 5.6 Safe Computing"

          description: "I get the error only when trying to add this markdown chunk.\n\n### Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy\n\n-   **Intro to EIPM:** This unit is students' first experience with the Explore, Investigate, Practice, Make lesson sequence, or EIPM. This structured approach to teaching programming is covered in detail in the curriculum guide and we highly recommend that you watch the [accompanying video series][0] to better understand what EIPM should look like in the classroom. When used effectively, it supports deep learning of content and helps maintain a collaborative classroom culture, even as you move into more complex programming concepts.\n-   **Scaffolding Towards Independent Projects:** A major goal of this course is to empower students to design and build projects independently. The Create PT in Unit 8 offers students enormous freedoms to scope and build projects, and even this unit begins scaffolding towards that goal. Individual EIPM sequences of lessons gradually prepare students for scoped, independent Make projects. The unit project has a few requirements, but students are largely free to choose the design, topic, and implementation of their ideas. As you teach the unit, look for the opportunities to scaffold the skills and knowledge students will need to creatively and independently tackle the unit project.\n    ### Major Assessment and Projects\n    The unit project asks students to design an app that makes a recommendation based on input information from the user. Students are given a great deal of freedom to choose their topic, design their user interface, and decide how to actually program their app's behavior. Students submit their app, project guide, and written responses to reflection questions about how the app is designed and the development process they used to make it. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n    ### AP Connections\n    This unit and unit project helps build towards the enduring understandings listed below. For a detailed mapping of units to Learning Objectives and EKs please see the \"Standards\" page for this unit.\n-   CRD-2: Developers create and innovate using an iterative design process that is user-focused, that incorporates implementation/feedback cycles, and that leaves ample room for experimentation and risk-taking.\n-   AAP-1: To find specific solutions to generalizable problems, programmers represent and organize data in multiple ways.\n-   AAP-2: The way statements are sequenced and combined in a program determines the computed result. Programs incorporate iteration and selection constructs to represent repetition and make decisions to handle varied input values.\n-   AAP-3: Programmers break down problems into smaller and more manageable pieces. By creating procedures and leveraging parameters, programmers generalize processes that can be reused. Procedures allow programmers to draw upon existing code that has already been tested, allowing them to write programs more quickly and with more confidence.\n    This unit includes content from the following topics from the AP CS Principles Framework. For more detailed information on topic coverage in the course review [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage][1].\n-   1.4 Identifying and Correcting Errors\n-   3.1 Variables and Assignment\n-   3.3 Mathematical Expressions\n-   3.5 Boolean Expressions\n-   3.6 Conditionals\n-   3.7 Nested Conditionals\n-   3.15 Random Values\n    The College Board has supplied formative Create PT questions to help prepare students to complete the Create Task.

            This unit is a hands-on introduction to developing a machine learning model with tabular data. Students explore how computers learn from data to make decisions, then develop machine learning projects around real-world data. The unit culminates in designing a machine learning app to solve a personally relevant problem.

            This unit assumes students are familiar with App Lab, specifically using Design Mode to create a user interface and using Events to change the screen when clicking a button. [Click Here][0] to learn more about recommendations for introducing students to App Lab before this unit.

            **Professional Development:** If you are interested in teaching this course, we recommend completing the free [AI/ML Self-Paced Professional Development Module][1]. The module is designed to take 2 hours to complete. No previous experience with coding or AI is assumed.

              display_name: Chapter 1 - Understanding Machine Learning
              description: Students learn the basics of machine learning and use a tool called AI Lab to create machine learning models that can be used in App Lab. The unit starts with an overview of machine learning and how computers can use patterns in data to make decisions and predictions. Then, students learn how to use AI Lab to train models from tabular data while exploring issues of bias. Lessons follow a repeating "unplugged - AI Lab - App Lab" pattern so students are continually exposed to the concepts and tools of machine learning. The chapter culminates in a project where students select from a set of real-world datasets to train a machine learning model and create an app.

          description: "In this unit, students create objects and define instance variables to represent attributes. Students explore creating and using constructors to establish values for these attributes and learn how to work with the data stored in objects. Students implement accessor and mutator methods to access and modify the values stored in the instance variables as well as write `toString` methods to output information about the state of the object. While creating and working with objects, students use the `Scanner` class to obtain user input to use as program data, learn about data types, operators, and expressions to store and manipulate data in variables, and develop an understanding of data encapsulation and object-oriented design decisions.\n\n### AP Classroom Personal Progress Checks\n\nTo assign questions from the AP Classroom Question Bank that align with this unit, create a custom quiz in AP Classroom by searching the Question Bank for the Essential Knowledge statements on the unit's [**Standards**][0] page. You can find instructions and video demonstrations to do this on [**AP Central**][1].\n\nThe following Personal Progress Checks in AP Classroom can be assigned during the Show What You Know week:\n\n-   Personal Progress Check 1\n-   Personal Progress Check 5\n-   Personal Progress Check 9\n\n**_Note:_** _Some Learning Objectives and Essential Knowledge statements in the suggested Personal Progress Checks are covered in later units._"

If your class finishes the entire 7-part module, students will write their own poems, investigate word choice, learn how to use prompts and variables, learn how to code conditional statements, and create a poem generator app to share with friends. \n\nThe Coding with Poetry is part of Code.org’s [CS Connections][0] curriculum, which is meant to integrate CS into other subject areas like math, ELA, and science with alignment to CCSS, NGSS, and CSTA standards. \n\n**First time teaching with Code.org?** To get started, watch these videos:\n\n-   [Basic Features of Code.org][1] \n-   [Creating a Class Section][2]\n-   [The Student Experience][3]\n-   [Progress, Feedack, and Assessment][4]"

Students practice predicting the outcome of program code and use their `Painter` objects with conditional statements, `while` loops, and Boolean expressions to navigate mazes and create drawings. While students work with the `Painter`, they practice identifying syntax and logic errors to explain why code segments will not compile or work as intended. Additionally, students learn to document program code using comments to describe the behavior of specific code segments. Throughout this unit, students discover their identity as software engineers and use debugging strategies and code reviews to improve their programming skills.\n\n### AP Classroom Personal Progress Checks\n\nTo assign questions from the AP Classroom Question Bank that align with this unit, create a custom quiz in AP Classroom by searching the Question Bank for the Essential Knowledge statements on the unit's [**Standards**][0] page.

          description: "This unit expands on the object-oriented programming principles introduced in Unit 1 to explore design principles as students develop classes with attributes and behaviors and work with primitive and object data. Students learn to work with variables and user input as they develop and utilize classes and objects to represent desserts, customers, and food trucks for the Project Mercury Pastries Food Truck business. As students work with the `Dessert` class, they build on their knowledge of inheritance to design subclasses that represent specific types of desserts. While working with variables, students learn to create and evaluate expressions using assignment and relational operators and trace code segments to determine the result of output. Throughout this unit, students continue to develop software engineering skills as they learn to use UML diagrams to represent classes and the DRY principle to refactor program code.\n\n### AP Classroom Personal Progress Checks\n\nTo assign questions from the AP Classroom Question Bank that align with this unit, create a custom quiz in AP Classroom by searching the Question Bank for the Essential Knowledge statements on the unit's [**Standards**][0] page.

          description: "This unit expands on the object-oriented programming principles introduced in Unit 1 to explore design principles as students develop classes with attributes and behaviors and work with primitive and object data. Students learn to write no-argument constructors to assign default values and parameterized constructors to assign specific values to an object's instance variables. They explore how the `this` keyword can be used to reduce ambiguity and redundancies in their program and how the `super` keyword can be used to call a superclass constructor or method. Students also learn how to work with variables and write expressions using arithmetic and compound assignment operators and practice tracing code segments to determine the output. After working with instance variables and constructors, they write accessor and mutator methods to work with the values assigned to an object's instance variables and `toString()` methods to display information about an object to the console. Throughout this unit, students continue to develop software engineering skills as they learn to make design decisions and use inheritance to create class hierarchies.\n\n<details style=\"padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">\n    <summary style=\"font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;\">\U0001F3AF Unit Objectives</summary>\n    <div style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;\">\n        <p><strong><em>By the end of this unit, students will be able to . . .</em></strong></p>\n\n-   Represent attributes of an object using instance variables\n\n-   Write no-argument and parameterized constructors to set the state of an object\n\n-   Use the `super` keyword to refer to the superclass in constructors and methods\n\n-   Write expressions using arithmetic operators and compound assignment operators with variables and object data\n\n-   Write accessor and mutator methods to obtain and modify object data\n\n-   Write `toString()` methods and use escape sequences to display and format information about an object to the console\n    </div>\n    </details>\n\n<details style=\"padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">\n    <summary style=\"font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;\">✅ AP Classroom Personal Progress Checks</summary>\n    <div style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;\">\n        <p>To assign questions from the AP Classroom Question Bank that align with this unit, create a custom quiz in AP Classroom by searching the Question Bank for the Essential Knowledge statements on the unit's <a href=\"https://studio.code.org/s/csa2-2023/standards\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Standards</strong></a> page.

          student_description: "This unit expands on the object-oriented programming principles introduced in Unit 1 to explore design principles as you develop classes with attributes and behaviors and work with primitive and object data. You learn to work with variables and user input as you develop and utilize classes and objects to represent desserts, customers, and food trucks for the Project Mercury Pastries Food Truck business. As you work with the `Dessert` class, you build on your knowledge of inheritance to design subclasses that represent specific types of desserts. While working with variables, you learn to create and evaluate expressions using assignment and relational operators and trace code segments to determine the result of output. Throughout this unit, you continue to develop software engineering skills as you learn to use UML diagrams to represent classes and the DRY principle to refactor program code.\n\n<details style=\"padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">\n    <summary style=\"font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;\">\U0001F3AF Unit Objectives</summary>\n    <div style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;\">\n        <p><strong><em>By the end of this unit, you will be able to . . .</em></strong></p>\n\n-   Represent attributes of an object using instance variables\n\n-   Write no-argument and parameterized constructors to set the state of an object\n\n-   Use the `super` keyword to refer to the superclass in constructors and methods\n\n-   Write expressions using arithmetic operators and compound assignment operators with variables and object data\n\n-   Write accessor and mutator methods to obtain and modify object data\n\n-   Write `toString()` methods and use escape sequences to display and format information about an object to the console\n    </div>\n    </details>"

While natural language processing (NLP) is a complicated field, it is fairly easy to create a simple program to respond to English sentences.

            **Prerequisites**

            Before doing this lab, students should be able to:

            -   locate websites using a web browser
            -   run and edit Java programs that use classes
            -   trace code
            -   read APIs for both the standard Java libraries and local code

            From Eliza in the 1960s to Siri and Watson today, the idea of talking to computers in natural language has fascinated people. More and more, computer programs allow people to interact with them by typing English sentences. The field of computer science that addresses how computers can understand human language is called natural language processing (NLP).

            NLP is a field that attempts to have computers understand natural (i.e., human) language. There are many exciting breakthroughs in the field.

            For this lab, you will explore some of the basics of NLP. As you explore this, you will work with a variety of methods of the `String` class and practice using the `if` statement. You will trace a method to find words in user input.

          description_short: The Consumer Review lab explores how reviews for products and services are evaluated and sometimes manipulated. Students work with methods in the String class and practice using conditionals and iteration to design and implement algorithms to process text files containing reviews.
          description: "The Consumer Review Lab provides students with the opportunity to work on a larger assignment involving multiple classes early in the course, before they necessarily know how to write their own classes. By focusing on calling methods and using the control structures of selection and iteration, students will have practice that directly relates to the **Methods and Control Structures** free-response question type that they will see on the end-of-year exam. Because students often struggle with methods in the `String` class, this lab specifically focuses on calling these methods and building strings in an interesting and engaging way.\n\n### Real-World Connection\n\nWe all use reviews on a regular basis, to help us determine which movie to see, which video game to play, or even which pair of headphones to buy. But how easy is it to fake a review? The truth is that it's incredibly simple, and fake reviews can have significant impacts on the products that are purchased or consumed, including movies that people watch and restaurants where they choose to eat. If consumers knew that the review they were reading and using to base a decision on came from a computer program and not a human, they might be less likely to believe it.\n\nWhat motivation do people have for creating these fake reviews or comments, and what should be done to prevent it, if anything? If technology can be used to create and post positive reviews for the company's own products or negative reviews of the competition, what are the ethical implications of this?\n\nCreating fake reviews has ethical implications, and it is important to emphasize that although students are going through the process to see one way in which they can be generated, this is in no way advocating this type of behavior. This is similar to \"white hat\" hackers needing to understand the same tools and processes of criminal hackers in order to do their job. Discuss with students the ethical concerns and how understanding this process is important to preventing unwanted behaviors online."

          description: "This unit is a hands-on introduction to developing a machine learning model with tabular data. Students explore how computers learn from data to make decisions, then develop machine learning projects around real-world data. The unit culminates in designing a machine learning app to solve a personally relevant problem.\n\n::: details [**Chapter 1 Overview**]\n**Description:** Students learn the basics of machine learning and use a tool called AI Lab to create machine learning models that can be used in App Lab. The unit starts with an overview of machine learning and how computers can use patterns in data to make decisions and predictions. Then, students learn how to use AI Lab to train models from tabular data while exploring issues of bias. Lessons follow a repeating \"unplugged - AI Lab - App Lab\" pattern so students are continually exposed to the concepts and tools of machine learning. The chapter culminates in a project where students select from a set of real-world datasets to train a machine learning model and create an app.\n\n**Goals:**\n\n-   Create a machine learning model in AI Lab to solve a problem, and use App Lab to create an app that uses their model. \n-   Understand how machine learning models make decisions from data\n\n**Big Questions:**\n\n-   How does machine learning find patterns in data to make decisions?\n-   How can we avoid bias when training a machine learning model?\n\n:::\n\n::: details [**Chapter 2 Overview**]\n**Description:** This chapter prepares students to be machine learning scientists to create an app that addresses an issue in their community. Students follow along with a fictional group of students as they define an issue, develop a survey to collect data, analyze their data in AI Lab, create a model card, and create an app to solve their problem. Then, in the final project, students repeat these same steps with an issue they care about in their community.\n\n**Goals:**\n\n-   Create machine learning models in AI Lab  from their own data and use App Lab to create an app that uses their model to solve problems in their community. \n\n**Big Questions:**\n\n-   How can machine learning be used to solve problems in our community?\n\n:::\n\n::: details [**Implementation Guidance for the AI and Machine Learning Unit**]\n\n-   Guidance for how to support students in programming levels and differentiate tasks are available in the [Programming Levels Guide][0] and [Differentiation Guide][1]\n-   You can view the full [Implementation Guide][2] for more information about this unit\n    :::\n\n::: details [**Professional Development**]\nIf you are interested in teaching this course, we recommend completing the free [AI/ML Self-Paced Professional Development Module][3].

A major focus of the unit is building a positive classroom culture in which students work together, explore problems, and communicate about their thinking. Most lessons either feature physical manipulatives or a digital widget, and the bulk of lesson time should be spent with students exploring these tools together to develop an understanding of the concepts they highlight. The course intentionally does not start with programming since, in many classrooms, some students have experience with programming and others do not. Choosing to begin with digital information and the internet lets you build community in the room while exploring a topic that is likely to be accessible to all students. The supportive and inclusive classroom environment built in this unit should help set a positive tone that can be carried through the school year.\n\n#### Empowering \"Deciders\"\n\n An important goal of the course is not merely to teach students technical knowledge, but to put those skills to work in meaningful ways. This unit builds towards the unit project, which provides an opportunity for students to be \"deciders\" about the impacts of computing on modern life. Other units will emphasize empowering units as \"creators.\"\n:::\n\n::: details [**⭐️ Major Assessment and Projects**]\n\n \n\nThe unit project asks students to consider and debate issues that arise in modern society due to the digitizing of information. Students will analyze an article that addresses the intersection of digitizing information and current events. They will evaluate what data is being digitized and evaluate the benefits and harms caused by making this information digital. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n\n:::\n\n::: details [**✅ AP Connections**]\n \n\nThis unit and its associated project help build towards the enduring understandings listed below. For a detailed mapping of units to Learning Objectives and EKs, please see the \"Standards\" page for this unit.\n\n-   DAT-1: The way a computer represents data internally is different from the way the data is interpreted and displayed for the user.

As students move from lesson to lesson, the version of the Internet Simulator they use will have slightly more functionality than the last. Lessons will present students with challenges that closely mimic those that the internet's original inventors needed to solve. Students will collaboratively design and test solutions to those problems to develop an intuitive understanding of how the internet works and why it was designed that way. By the end of the unit, students will have \"invented the internet\" themselves! \n\n#### Continuing to Establish a Strong Classroom Culture\n\nMuch like the Digital Information unit that comes before it, this unit emphasizes collaborative problem solving and developing a supportive and inclusive classroom culture. \n:::\n\n::: details [**⭐️ Major Assessment and Projects**]\n\n \nThe unit project asks students to design a policy position for an imaginary political candidate related to an \"Internet Dilemma.\" Students must analyze news stories about their topic to identify impacted groups, explain those groups' interests, explain technical background about the dilemma, and then recommend a policy solution that the candidate should advocate for.

It is designed to maintain the collaborative and inclusive classroom environment developed in the previous two units. The collaborative project, fun, unplugged activities, and the focus on experimenting should help keep your whole class working together and trying out ideas. \n\n#### Emphasizing Skills\n\nSince this is the first of many programming units, it emphasizes attitudes and skills that will serve your students well for the remainder of the year. The project that runs through this unit emphasizes that programming is a creative and collaborative endeavor that students can use to help others. Key practices like pair programming and debugging help normalize working with a partner, asking for help, and making mistakes. While students have a lot to learn about programming and App Lab, there is just as much emphasis on establishing these positive habits and mindsets. \n\n#### Empowering \"Creators\"\n\nThis unit empowers students to be creators with a major emphasis on making personally meaningful apps. Students have a lot to learn about programming. Still, the goal is for students to come away from this unit, seeing programming as a powerful form of personal expression that allows them to draw on their innate talents and interests to help solve problems in their community.\n\n:::\n\n::: details [**⭐️ Major Assessment and Projects**]\n\n \n\nThe unit project asks students to collaborate with a classmate to design an app that can teach others about a topic of shared interest.

This structured approach to teaching programming is covered in detail in the curriculum guide. We highly recommend watching the [accompanying video series][0] to better understand what EIPM should look like in the classroom. When used effectively, it supports deep learning of content and helps maintain a collaborative classroom culture, even as you move into more complex programming concepts.\n\n#### Scaffolding Towards Independent Projects\n\nA major goal of this course is to empower students to design and build projects independently. The Create PT in Unit 8 offers students enormous freedom to scope and build projects, and even this unit begins scaffolding towards that goal. Individual EIPM sequences of lessons gradually prepare students for scoped, independent Make projects. The unit project has a few requirements, but students are largely free to choose the design, topic, and implementation of their ideas. As you teach the unit, look for the opportunities to scaffold the skills and knowledge students will need to creatively and independently tackle the unit project.\n\n:::\n\n::: details [**⭐️ Major Assessment and Projects**]\n\n \n\nThe unit project asks students to design an app that makes a recommendation based on information from user input.

In the unit project, you'll analyze a dataset of your choosing and present your findings. \n\n::: details [**\U0001F9D0 Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy**]\n\n#### The Data Analysis Process\n\nThis unit is built around a data analysis process that helps students break down how data is turned into new information about the world. Some lessons are designed around different steps of this process, like cleaning data or building visualizations. Other lessons focus on ways this process is applied in real-world contexts like citizen science or machine learning. The data analysis process helps provide a consistent reference point as students explore the importance of data analysis in computing. \n\n#### Exploring Data with the Data Visualizer\n\nThe Data Visualizer is a tool built into App Lab that allows students to quickly create visualizations of the data they've added to their projects. The set of possible visualizations is intentionally limited to a few ways to change or modify the chart. This tool aims to encourage exploring the different kinds of questions that can be answered with data visualizations, with a greater emphasis on students' ability to create a variety of visualizations quickly. This exploration should also help students build more meaningful and powerful apps in future units when they start using these datasets in their programs.\n:::\n\n::: details [**⭐️ Major Assessment and Projects**]\n \n\nStudents use the data visualizer to find and present a data story. Using what they've learned about the data analysis process, students either choose a dataset inside the data library or upload one of their own and create visualizations that find interesting patterns that may reveal new insights and knowledge. Students complete an activity guide describing their findings and the process they used in identifying them.

          description: "This unit introduces lists, loops, and traversals, and explores the way they can be used to build apps that store and process large amounts of information. Learn to program with the data library in App Lab and complete a 5-day hackathon project at the end of the unit where you can design a program about any topic of your choosing.\n\n::: details [**\U0001F9D0 Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy**]\n\n#### Independent Creation and The Hackathon Project\n\nMuch like the project in Unit 4, the \"Hackathon\" project in this unit is designed as an opportunity for students to creatively and independently build something with their programming skills. While students are asked to include some technical requirements in their program to ensure they demonstrate mastery of new programming concepts, they have free rein to choose the goals, design, and implementation of their project. To avoid asking students to complete a major programming project right before the Create PT, this hackathon is the most \"Create-PT-like\" project of the course. It is the best chance for students to practice skills like budgeting time or scoping an open-ended project. In many classrooms, if you maintain the recommended pacing of the course, this project serves as an excellent end to the first semester.\n\n#### Growing Comfort with EIPM\n\nBy this unit, students (and teachers!) should be developing greater comfort with the flow of EIPM lessons. Students may begin to anticipate that sequences build towards an independent Make lesson or look forward to stepping away from computers to Explore. A nice feature of EIPM is that you will find strategies and modifications to each lesson type that work best for your students. Keep an eye out for how you and your students are developing comfort with EIPM and note strategies that help meet your classroom's needs.\n\n#### Programming with Real-world Data\n\nThe Data Library is a feature in App Lab designed to let students program with data from the real world. This tool aims to motivate students to build new kinds of data-powered apps that they find personally interesting. This tool also facilitates programming with lists of information since students will need to manipulate lists of data to incorporate the different data sources. Encourage students to use datasets they find personally relevant as they draw on their creative ideas for bringing data to life.\n:::\n\n::: details [**⭐️ Major Assessment and Projects**]\nThe unit project asks students to spend five days as part of a \"Hackathon\" project that they have nearly complete independence to scope and design. Students must choose one dataset from the Data Library in AppLab to be a component of their project to demonstrate what they have learned about lists and list processing; otherwise, scoping the project is completely up to them. Students submit their app, project guide, and written responses to reflection questions about how the app is designed and the development process they used to make it. Students will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n:::\n\n::: details [**✅ AP Connections**]\n \n\nThis unit and unit project helps build towards the enduring understandings listed below.

End the unit by designing a library of functions around any topic of your choosing.\n\n::: details [**\U0001F9D0 Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy**]\n\n#### Learning by Building Libraries\n\nIn the second EIPM sequence of this unit, students learn to use the Student-Create Libraries tool in App Lab. This tool allows them to build and share libraries of functions that they can use in many different projects. This tool serves many purposes besides simply teaching students about libraries. By having to write functions that other students find useful, they will need to think about common patterns or situations that they have seen in projects across the course. Students will also practice commenting their code so others can understand how it works, practice designing functions that use parameters and return.  \n\n#### Final Preparation for the Create PT\n\nStudents learn very few new concepts in this unit; nevertheless, it can be challenging because students need to learn how to integrate the ideas of parameters and return with every other concept they have learned in this course. This unit presents a good opportunity to do a final review of every programming construct covered in the course as students prepare to demonstrate what they've learned on the Create PT.\n:::\n\n::: details [**⭐️ Major Assessment and Projects**]\n \n\nThe unit project asks students to design a library of functions that they can share with classmates. Their library must contain at least two functions, and at least one of those functions must include a parameter, return, a loop, and an if-statement. This requirement ensures students practice skills they will use in the Create PT. Using a project guide, students choose a theme for their library, build it, test it, and exchange feedback with other students. Students submit their library code, project guide, and written responses to reflection questions about how the app is designed and the development process they used to make it. They will also complete an end-of-unit assessment aligned with CS Principles framework objectives covered in this unit.\n\n:::\n\n::: details [**✅ AP Connections**]\n \n\nThis unit and unit project helps build towards the enduring understandings listed below.

Throughout the unit participate in a \"school of the future\" conference in which you and a team make a proposal for how best to improve school life with computing innovations.\n\n::: details [**\U0001F9D0 Unit Philosophy and Pedagogy**]\n\n#### Learning Through Full-class Simulation\n\nThe simulation project that runs through this unit serves several important goals. It helps contextualize what students are learning by moving from abstract ideas of privacy or security to concrete potential innovations. Since the simulation is based on modernizing schools, students can consider the consequences of computing innovations in a familiar setting. By taking on an assigned role and interacting with a group of teammates who have done the same, students must consider a breadth of interests and goals beyond their own when it comes to innovating in schools. \n\n#### Ending the Year as \"Deciders\"\n\nA major theme students engage with throughout this unit is the need to consider both sides of technological innovation. Computing technology has led to both benefits and harms to culture, economy, and society at large. Responding to important questions facing our world requires understanding technology and an ability to identify and interpret the impacts it causes. This unit is not designed to advocate for any particular point of view on the impact of technology. Still, it should empower students to adeptly see and weigh the consequences of the technology around them. While the Create PT may feel like the most significant project of this course, the Explore Curricular requirement and the questions faced in this unit are arguably more crucial. Many of the young people who take CS Principles may pursue studies or careers in which they are \"creators\" with technology, but all of them will need to be thoughtful \"deciders\" in a world profoundly shaped by computing. \n:::\n\n::: details [**⭐️ Major Assessment and Projects**]\n \n\nStudents complete the Future School Convention simulation throughout this unit. Working in teams of roughly five people, students are assigned a role and a set of interests they'll need to investigate. They research real-world innovations that could improve schools and align with the interests of their character. Throughout the unit, they are given opportunities to refine their proposals as a team and debate the benefits and risks of different computing innovations. Eventually, their team submits an overall proposal for the Future School, and all students vote for the team and innovation they believe to be the best.

          description: "In the Creating Apps with Devices unit, students explore the role of physical devices in computing. Using App Lab and Adafruit’s Circuit Playground, students develop programs that utilize the same hardware inputs and outputs that you see in the smart devices, looking at how a simple rough prototype can lead to a finished product. Then, students explore how physical devices can be used to react to the world around them using a “maker” mindset to create prototypes with everyday materials.\n\n⚠️ This unit uses the **Circuit Playground** to introduce physical computing and the \"maker\" mindset. You can also teach this content using **micro:bit** devices by assigning the [Creating Apps with Devices - micro:bit unit][0]. Both units teach the same content and are equivalent - you do not need to buy both sets of devices or teach both units.\n\n::: details [**Chapter 1 Overview**]\n**Description:** This unit emphasizes the interactions between inputs and outputs on the circuit playground and an app screen. On their circuit playground, students learn to control inputs like buttons or toggle switches and outputs like the buzzer or LED. Students also interact with inputs and outputs in App Lab, such as buttons and text inputs and dropdowns. By the end of the chapter, students will be able to create an app that controls a device, similar to many \"smart\" hardware they may experience in their day-to-day lives.\n\n**Goals:**\n\n-   Design and build a physical computing device that integrates physical inputs and outputs with digital apps. \n-   Create app prototypes that use a physical device to control a digital app.\n\n**Big Questions:**\n\n-   What inputs and outputs are available on a physical device?\n-   What inputs and outputs are available on an app?\n-   How can we create apps that use a physical device to control a digital app?\n\n:::\n\n::: details [**Chapter 2 Overview**]\n**Description:** In this chapter, students focus on how their physical device can interact with the outside world. They learn how to use sensors and the accelerometer to react to the physical environment. They learn to attach external LEDs and buttons that extend the types of devices they can make. Throughout the unit, students use physical materials like paper or cardboard to extend the functionality of their devices. By the end of the unit, students will have created an interactive art project and developed a prototype for a physical device that solves a problem.\n\n**Goals:**\n\n-   Design and build a physical computing device that integrates sensors with digital apps. \n-   Create app prototypes that use a physical device to solve real-world problems.\n-   Use physical computing to solve problems in fun and innovative ways.\n\n**Big Questions:**\n\n-   How can a physical device use sensors to react to a physical environment?\n-   How can simple hardware be used to develop innovative new products?\n\n:::\n\n::: details [**Implementation Guidance for Creating Apps with Devices**]\n\n-   This unit requires students to have access to Circuit Playground's - [click here][1] for more information about using Circuit Playground's in your classroom\n-   Guidance for how to support students in programming levels and differentiate tasks are available in the [Programming Levels Guide][2] and [Differentiation Guide][3]\n    :::\n\n::: details [**Professional Development**]\nIf you are interested in teaching this course, we recommend completing the free [Creating Apps for Devices Self-Paced Professional Development Module][4]. The module is designed to take 2 hours to complete. No previous experience with coding or devices is assumed.\n:::\n\n## Finished Teaching This Unit?\n\nAnswer this [**short survey**][5] to let the Code.org curriculum team know how the unit went."
          student_description: This unit explores the role of hardware platforms in computing and how different sensors can provide more effective input and output than the traditional keyboard, mouse, and monitor. Using App Lab and Adafruit’s Circuit Playground, you’ll develop programs that utilize the same hardware inputs and outputs that you see in the smart devices, looking at how a simple rough prototype can lead to a finished product. The unit concludes with a design challenge to use the Circuit Playground as the basis for an innovation of your own design.

Encourage students to share their interpretation, even if it’s different from someone else’s. Make sure that all students are familiar with the structure of a poem before Lesson 2, in which students will write their own poems.\n\n**Computer Science:**  Students will be working with sprites and events in the module. We recommend beginning with [Hello World][1] (45 minutes) where students will gain a basic introduction to sprites and how to animate them with events. "

To build a base understanding together you might consider reading one of these books about maps: [Maps by Aleksandra and Daniel Mizielinski][0], [The Once Upon a Time Map Book by BG Hennessy][1], or [City Atlas: Travel the World with 30 City Maps by Georgia Cherry][2].\n\nAdditionally, it may be beneficial to spend some time **building interactive maps with hands on materials in your classroom**: fill a bucket with colored strips of felt to represent roads, rivers, houses and more. Let students build and play in an imaginary town. Or after a shared experience (ie recess or field trip) create a topographical map using play-dough or salt dough.\n\n**Computer Science:** In this module students will be working a lot with sprites including changing the location and size of them and initiating behaviors. [CSFundamentals Course F Lesson 3][3] is a great introduction to two concepts at the heart of this all: sprites and behaviors."

Students make inferences based on the book cover about what genre a book may fall under.\n-   **Cover comparison**: show students multiple covers for the same book. Engage in a discussion about what is different in each cover and evaluation which version is best.\n\n**Computer Science:** In this module, students will learn the basics of coding using code.org's Sprite Lab. These activities may be supportive to engage in before starting the module:\n\n-   Introduce students to the idea of **events** with this unplugged activity: [The Big Event][0] (15-minute activity).

            These lessons supplement the [How AI Works][0] video series. Each lesson is paired with a single video from the series, diving-deeper into the concepts introduced in the videos. Lessons focus on creating an exciting first experience for students, where students engage in an activity or simulation and then reflect on the experience as a way to build understanding around AI and build empathy with those impacted by it. Some lessons focus more on the technology behind AI, while other lessons focus on the societal impacts and ethical considerations of AI.

            **Supports for Teachers:** You can learn more about bringing AI lessons to your classroom through our [AI 101 for Teachers series][1]. AI 101 for Teachers is a free, foundational online professional learning series for any teacher and educator interested in the groundbreaking world of artificial intelligence (AI) and its transformative potential in education.

            **Implementation Options:** Click one of the options below to expand and view more details.

            ::: details [<span style="font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold;">"I want to teach them all!"</spa>]
            Lessons 1-7 can be taught as a 7-day sequence, where each day focuses on an individual video from the video series and dives deeper into the concepts introduced. Classrooms that go this direction should hide Lesson 8, which does not fit in this sequence. [Click here to learn more about hiding lesson][2]
            :::

            ::: details [<span style="font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold;">"I want to teach a specific lesson or integrate into another class"</span>]
            Each lesson can stand on its own and be taught independently from the others. This is especially useful if you would like to integrate a lesson into another subject or an existing computer science, artificial intelligence, or general education class. Classrooms that go this direction should hide all lessons except the one you want to teach. [Click here to learn more about hiding lesson][3]

            Lesson 8 is designed for classrooms that want to introduce AI to students, but only have a day to do so. This lesson provides a notetaker for students as the class watches the entire video sequence. Classrooms that go this direction should hide all lessons except for Lesson 8.
