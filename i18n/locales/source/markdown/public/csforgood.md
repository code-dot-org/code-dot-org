<br>Computer science is a foundational subject in today’s world that will benefit students in any career path. It not only gives them room to flex their creativity but also equips them with the tools to tackle some of the world’s most pressing problems.

How computer science is used and applied in the real world is a crucial part of learning computer science. That is why we’re focusing on #CSforGood as the theme for the Hour of Code this year. We can help students understand some of the challenges that people around the world face and inspire them to think more deeply about the role computer science can play in creating a more equitable and sustainable world.

Using the <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/">United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</a> as a guide, our goal is to convey to students how computer science can make a positive impact in our world - from self-driving car technology that can make our roads safer, to data science techniques that can identify disease earlier and keep us healthier. <br><br>

<br>When considering CS for Good, we were inspired to think about the potential of Artificial Intelligence, and are pleased to introduce Code.org's brand-new Hour of Code activity: <a href="https://www.code.org/oceans">AI for Oceans</a>. In this activity, students will learn about AI, machine learning, training data, and bias, all while exploring ethical issues and how AI can be used to address world problems. It's also just one example of how CS is about much more than coding. Enjoy this first step in a new journey to teach more about AI!<br>

# Example #CSforGood discussion prompts
Here are some themes and questions to spark discussion in your classroom about the role of technology in creating positive social change. For a deeper discussion, pair these  prompts with <a href="#articles">stories of CS for Good in the real-world</a>. 

## **Technology can be part of the solution.** 
While large, systemic challenges like poverty and environmental sustainability often require attitude shifts, wide-scale cooperation, and in some cases, personal or collective sacrifice, technology can help jumpstart efforts, detect problems, and ease barriers.

### *Questions or prompts for discussion*: 
- Think of some challenges faced by people in your school, neighborhood, city, or anywhere else in the world. What are some solutions people have come up with to solve those problems? 
- How can computer science be combined with other efforts to address different parts of the problem?
- Are there any issues you think technology can’t help solve? Why or why not?

## **Computer science is helping address challenges, big and small, all around the world.** 
Whether building affordable technology to help farmers in sub-Saharan Africa, programming white blood cells to fight cancer, or revolutionizing the packaged foods industry with artificial intelligence, people are using CS in creative ways to solve problems and provide opportunities for others. 

### *Questions or prompts for discussion*: 
- Can you think of any problems in your own life that could be solved or helped using computer science? 
- What’s a recent example you’ve seen where technology was used to help solve a pressing problem somewhere in the world? 
- Do you think there are ways to use computer science in addressing big issues like healthcare, access to clean water, or poverty?

Note for teachers: Use the above articles OR find a few of your own and distribute them to students to read beforehand. Then, use them to structure your discussion.

## **With great power comes great responsibility.** 
Computer science can be a source of positive change...or it can create new challenges. By recognizing that CS, like any tool, requires thoughtfulness and ethical responsibility, we can empower students to think critically and work on solving problems holistically.

### *Questions or prompts for discussion*:
- Should there be rules or guidelines in place for how to use computer science to solve big issues? 
- If so, why or why not?
- Can you brainstorm any? 

## **Today’s students will be tomorrow’s problem-solvers, innovators, and decision-makers.** 
The more accessible CS education is, the more students we can reach and the more inclusive, diverse, and impactful tomorrow’s technology and solutions will be. 

### *Questions or prompts for discussion*: 
- Why is it important that everyone has access to learn computer science? 
- What do you think might happen to solutions and programs if only the same kind of person studied computer science?
- Can you think of what you might say to someone to encourage them to learn computer science?
