<p>The events of this year—a global pandemic, economic recession, worldwide protests against racial inequities—have shown us both the great promise and the perils of our technology. We rely on technology to keep us connected (Zoom, anyone?), but we’ve also seen how biased algorithms can divide us on the basis of race or gender. We rely on our technology to keep us informed, but we’ve also seen how easy it is to spread misinformation. We rely on our technology to stay productive, but we’ve left behind those who don’t have access to the internet.</p>
<p>How CS and technology are used and applied in the real world is a crucial part of learning computer science. We can help students understand some of the challenges that people around the world face and inspire them to think deeply about the role computer science can play in creating a more equitable and sustainable world.</p>

<h2>Discussing #CSforGood with your students</h2>
<p>Here are some themes and questions to spark discussion in your classroom about the role of computer science in creating positive social change. <a href="/files/csforgood-discussion-2020.pdf" target="_blank">Download this discussion guide as a PDF</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>We learn CS to detect problems</strong></h3>

<div class="educate-callout-box" style="width:300px; height:235px; background-color:#7665a0; color:#ffffff; padding:20px; border-radius:15px; float:right; margin-left:20px">
  <p><strong>Is your class virtual this year?</strong></p>
  <p>Try using breakout rooms to pair or group students together.</p>
  <p>If breakout rooms aren’t available, use a shared document or slide deck (<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pGcC3Nn_qCvXIChdatuVWqVwnGi6HOt8qJqSwB5YU6w/edit#slide=id.p" target="_blank" style="color:#ffffff">template</a>), designating sections of the document or a single slide for each group of students.</p>
</div>

<p>Building a society we want to live in begins with understanding the problems we need to address. We can use technology to detect and even predict problems.</p>
<p>Have students read this story about <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-google-quake/google-turns-android-phones-into-earthquake-sensors-california-to-get-alerts-idUSKCN2571TN" target="_blank">how smartphones are being used to detect earthquakes</a> and then work in pairs or groups to answer the questions below. Then discuss as a class.</p>
<p><i>Questions for discussion:</i></p>
<ul>
<li>What technology does the article discuss?</li>
<li>What problem is Google trying to solve? Why is this important?</li>
<li>What are other ways that computer science or technology can help detect problems?</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>We learn CS to find creative solutions</strong></h3>
<p>Learning computer science gives us a foundation to find solutions. It is our creativity then that enables us in every industry and aspect of life to design solutions built upon that foundation.</p>
<p>Have students read this story about <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/22/1008675/ai-planners-minecraft-urban-design-healthier-happier-cities/" target="_blank">how urban planners are using AI in Minecraft to design better cities</a>, and then work in pairs or groups to answer the questions below. Then discuss as a class.</p>
<p><i>Questions for discussion:</i></p>
<ul>
<li>What technology does the article discuss?</li>
<li>What challenge or challenges are participants trying to address?</li>
<li>Think of the technology that you use on a daily basis. What does it help you do? What problems or challenges does it help you solve?</li>
<li>Can you think of a time you used technology in a way it wasn’t necessarily intended, in order to solve a problem?</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>We learn CS to connect with each other</strong></h3>

<iframe src="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/students-sing-together-from-home-after-coronavirus-cancels-concert/" id="cbsNewsVideo" allowfullscreen allow="fullscreen" frameborder="0" width="325px" height="183px" style="float:right; margin-left:20px"></iframe>

<p>From video chats and classes to apps that allow us to sing together remotely, people have built technical innovations that have kept us connected with some semblance of community through a global pandemic. And, we will continue to find ways to humanize technology to unite us.</p>
<p>Have students watch this video (<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/students-sing-together-from-home-after-coronavirus-cancels-concert/?intcid=CNM-00-10abd1h" target="_blank">link to original video at CBS News</a>) of students from Chino Valley Unified School District singing an a capella version of “Over the Rainbow” via video conference after covid-19 canceled their annual Choral Festival. Then have them work in pairs or groups to answer the questions below.</p>
<p><i>Questions for discussion:</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Name as many of the technologies as you can that enabled these students to sing together despite stay-at-home orders due to covid.</li>
<li>Do you use any of these technologies? How frequently--weekly? daily?</li>
<li>Have you used technology lately to make art? Record music? Write poetry? Play games with friends? Talk to family members? If you did not have access to these technologies, what would you do?</li>
<li>Should everyone have access to these technologies? Why or why not?</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>We learn CS to ensure equity and inclusion</strong></h3>
<p>The pandemic has exposed the digital divide like never before. Everyone must have the opportunity to learn computer science to have a part in building a future where all of us are included and all our voices heard.</p>
<p>Have students read this story about a new tool that <a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/princeton-tool-helps-clear-biases-computer-vision/" target="_blank">helps root out potential biases in image sets that are used to train artificial intelligence (AI)</a>, and then work in pairs or groups to answer the questions below. Then discuss as a class.</p>
<ul>
<li>What does this tool do and what problem is it trying to solve?</li>
<li>What do you think ‘open-source’ means? Why would the researchers make their tool open-source?</li>
<li>What are some of the examples mentioned in the article of biases in image sets? Can you think of any others?</li>
<li>Why is it important to be able to identify these biases? How does this relate to equity and inclusion?</li>
</ul>
