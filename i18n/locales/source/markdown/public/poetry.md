## Learn more about Coding with Poetry

In the Coding with Poetry module in CS Connections, students will be able to see two subjects—computer science and poetry—in a new way. Over the course of five lessons, 4-8th-grade students build a poem-generating program to recite different versions of a haiku they wrote. Then, students test their programs with their classmates and complete the project by sharing their user-generated poems in a poetry circle.

By building a poem generator, students learn about how computers take in user input, store it in memory, and output a desired product. By writing their own haikus, students explore elements of poetry like grammar, mood, and word choice. 

Our Poem Art Hour of Code activity is also the first lesson in the Coding with Poetry module of our Computer Science Connections curriculum.
