Some of the work has already been done for you.  You just need to decide what the different parts of the room will look like by picking pictures!\n\n# Do This\n\n-   The level starts in Design Mode\n-   For each image element that is blank (gray rectangle) add an appropriate image. For example you will need a door image for the image element labeled door.\n-   An example of what the room might look like are on the right."
