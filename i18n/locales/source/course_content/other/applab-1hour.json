This level has an example app that you should play around with to get the feel for what you will be creating.\n\n# Do This\n\n-   Click RUN to start the app\n-   Try to find the key that will open the door.",

Some of the work has already been done for you.  You just need to decide what the different parts of the room will look like by picking pictures!\n\n# Do This\n\n-   The level starts in Design Mode\n-   For each image element that is blank (gray rectangle) add an appropriate image. For example you will need a door image for the image element labeled door.\n-   An example of what the room might look like are on the right.",

We can do this using an `if` statement. An if statement checks if a condition is true, in this case it will check if the number the user entered is equal to the secret code\n\n# Do This\n\n-   Inside the `onEvent` block for the safe below the prompt command add an <img src=\"https://images.code.org/5e9a434b1ad6b8f010db928b668127a5-image-1491061131564.37.01 AM.png\" style=\"width:100px\"> statement \n-   Create the condition by pulling out the <img src=\"https://images.code.org/f0680979704c30975550211b03ed222e-image-1491061134985.37.08 AM.png\" style=\"width:100px\"> block which will check if two things are equal\n-   On one side of <img src=\"https://images.code.org/f0680979704c30975550211b03ed222e-image-1491061134985.37.08 AM.png\" style=\"width:100px\"> put _guess_ (the name of the value we used to store the users guess)\n-   On the other side put the value for your secret code",
