    "https://studio.code.org/s/frequency_analysis/stage/1/puzzle/1": "# Break a random substitution cipher!\n\nMessages encrypted with the **Caesar cipher** are very easy to crack. What if instead of shifting the whole alphabet, we mapped every letter of the alphabet to a random different letter of the alphabet? This is called a **random substitution cipher**.\n\nIn this version of the tool, you'll be interacting more with the graphs that show letter frequency. By analyzing the frequency of the letters in the encrypted input message compared to the frequency of letters in a typical piece of English prose, you can start to narrow in on what some of the letter mappings might be. Did you know that _'E'_ is the most common letter used in the English language? Maybe the most common letter in your encrypted text maps to the letter _'E'_, but maybe not! You'll have to do a bit of guess and check to see if that substitution makes sense.\n\n# Do this\n\n-   Load the **Sample message (hard)** from the message dropdown. This will load a message that has been encrypted with a random substitution cipher.  \n    [][0]\n\n-   You will crack the message by guessing what each letter of the alphabet contained in the original ciphertext should be changed to. You can do so by dragging the blue letters of the alphabet directly underneath the orange letter you want changed in the original ciphertext. Letters that have been changed using your guesses will no longer be highlighted orange in the message window on the left.\n    [][1]\n\n-   Play with some of the sorting options available in the Random substitution cipher tab to get different views on the letter frequencies in the input text as well as standard English text.\n    [][2]\n\nSee how long it takes you to crack the cipher! Is this a good method of encrypting secret data?"
