A <a href=\"https://medium.com/@codeorg/code-org-resourceful-teachers-higher-student-achievement-8be1efdec06e\" target=\"blank\">recent research study</a> found that classrooms with resourceful teachers see higher scores on English, math, and science standardized tests after teaching CS Fundamentals lessons. \n\n### **Build confidence and interest early on**\nIf we wait until high school or college to introduce students to computer science, some students will already have decided that computer science is not for them or they will feel that they are already too far behind compared to students who study it outside of school.\n\nExposing students to computer science in grades K-5, when they don't have to opt-in to a class like they might in high school, allows all students to see how accessible the subject is, and decide if they enjoy it.\n\n### **It's fun!**\nComputer science gives students an opportunity to collaborate, be creative, and express themselves! \n\n### **Need more convincing?**\nCode.org has a lot of resources to help you -- as well as students, your administration, parents, and your community -- understand why CS is important in the classroom.

The different kinds of lessons in each concept chunk are explained in detail below.\n\nTo illustrate, here are the five lessons contained in the \"Loops\" concept chunk in Course C, as they appear in the course.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/953ebc5b17a97ee7fc9ee9261b4ee132-image-1571689334077.png\">\n\n## Unplugged lessons\n**These lessons are done away from the computer and are often used to introduce a new concept in a hands-on, tangible way.** Students will often work with pencil and paper or physical manipulatives.  These are intentionally placed kinesthetic opportunities that help students digest complicated concepts in ways that relate to their own lives. Often an unplugged lesson sets the stage for a subsequent skill-building lesson investigating the same concept on the computer.\n\n## Plugged lessons -- Skill building\n**These lessons are done on the computer and give students structured practice with a new tool or programming concept.** These puzzle progressions generally start with a sequence of practice puzzles that gradually increase until reaching a challenge puzzle. There are often additional puzzles after the challenge that intentionally get easier to help build efficacy and confidence at the end of the lesson.\n\n\n## Plugged lessons -- Application\n**These lessons are done on the computer and give students space to apply learned concepts in creative ways.** These lessons typically walk students through the creation of a mini-project that will be unique for them based on their own creative decisions. There are no right or wrong answers here!\n\n## End of course projects\nEach course offers the opportunity for students to take what they've learned at the end of a lesson and put it together into a unique project that represents their own creativity.

Take a moment to pause and reflect on what you feel like you have learned from this course so far, and go back to any parts you may have had questions on.\n\nRemember that you can always reference the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UqCgO06NzB1L6y83fnwnUcYdKr3MooJAaUZajj48DnI/preview\" target=\"blank\">Computer Science Fundamentals curriculum guide</a> for more information.\n\n## Things to remember\nAs you go forward in this course, keep in mind: \n- As with any discipline, the path towards mastery in computer science is infinite. From novices to veterans, **everyone has something to learn.** \n- Programming becomes more comfortable every time you come back to it. **You're not going to be an expert your first time.**\n- There's no way around it, the act of programming and **learning to program takes time, but anyone can do it!**\n\n<br/>\n\n> **Key Takeway:** The goal of the next several lessons is not to turn you into a computer scientist, but to instead help you feel comfortable enough with the core concepts that you are excited to share your knowledge with your students.\n"

      "markdown": "# Unplugged Lesson: Happy Maps\n\nWe like to introduce computer science topics with unplugged lessons. Then, we use bridging activities to transition into the online lessons later. Beginning with these unplugged lessons introduces concepts in a fun and friendly way. Then, students already feel familiar with the concept by the time that they get to the online lessons, and can relate the online lessons back to the unplugged activity.\n\nFor these programming stages that you will be going through, we will also start with examples of unplugged lessons. Read through the following lesson plan and watch the accompanying videos, thinking about how you would implement this in your classroom with your students.\n\n***\nCS Fundamentals primarily teaches students how to write computer programs. In order to do so, we will begin with **sequencing**. \n> **Sequencing** describes the simple process of ordering steps in a linear manner. \n\nFor example:\n- Step 1: Boil the egg \n- Step 2: Crack the egg\n- Step 3: Eat the egg\n\nSequences are the foundation of **algorithms**.\n> **Algorithms**  are lists of steps to complete a task. Programs, then, are algorithms transcribed into code for a computer to execute.\n\n***\n## **1. Review the \"<a href=\"https://curriculum.code.org/csf-20/coursea/3/\" target=\"blank\">Happy Maps</a>\" Lesson Plan from Course A.**\n\nCourse A is meant for Kindergarten students. Sequencing comes up in other courses, as well, and you can find examples of those lessons at the bottom of this page.\n\n## **2. Watch the student video: Happy Maps (found in lesson plan)**\nThis is a video that you would show your students to help introduce the concept of sequencing and kick off the unplugged lesson.\n\n***\n<a href=\"https://curriculum.code.org/csf-20/coursea/3/\" target=\"blank\">![](https://images.code.org/8871ce7afb8fa81eb805d4640e1b9a95-image-1573079151706.25.15 PM.png)</a>\n"

      "markdown": "# Teaching practice: Debugging\n\nEveryone gets bugs! Therefore, debugging is an essential skill all students should develop that builds on the student practices discussed above. Without strong debugging skills, students can become frustrated. Help keep students moving by implementing both active and reflective debugging strategies in your classroom.\n\n> **Debugging** is finding and fixing problems in an algorithm or program\n\n## Active Debugging\nNew programmers are prone to writing long chunks of code without pausing to read or test their work along the way, which can snowball into a program that is very hard to debug. To prevent this, we suggest implementing active debugging as part of a general coding philosophy.\n\nActive debugging describes the practice of debugging while coding. This generally means students taking time during coding exercises to read, process, and test small pieces of code that they have just written.\n\nUse this debugging guide to help with active debugging: \n\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/b17956e111a6ca4ec17ace55f7fdf69b-image-1571695775936.09.14 PM.png\">\n\n\n## Reflective Debugging\nReflective debugging is a practice in which students participate in debugging as an entire class. 'Bug talks' and keeping a 'bug tracker' are two examples of  strategies that can be used to implement reflective debugging in your classroom and are described below. Read more about these on <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UqCgO06NzB1L6y83fnwnUcYdKr3MooJAaUZajj48DnI/preview\" target=\"blank\">page 23 of the curriculum guide</a>. \n\nCheck out this video on debugging to learn more about the debugging process:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auv10y-dN4s\" target=\"blank\">![](https://images.code.org/281fbcbd84d0df2491e0c4050e612b97-image-1571696135948.13.58 PM.png)</a>\n"

You can also find the steps in **<a href=\"https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/115000488132-Creating-a-classroom-section\" target=\"blank\">this support article</a>**.\n\n***\n## Step 3: Assign the course to your section\nClick into the course that you are teaching. You can then click \"Assign Course\" and assign that course to one of your sections. \n***\n## Step 4: Start teaching! \nAll it takes is one lesson to bring computer science concepts into your classroom. Once you see your students enthusiasm for CS, go further with daily lesson plans to guide your students, unplugged activities you can do without a computer, and forums to connect to other teachers.\n\n\n"
