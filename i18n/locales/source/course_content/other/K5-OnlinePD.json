Suggested times are given for each stage.*** If you find yourself spending more or less time on a given stage, don't worry! Our main goal is for you to have fun, learn the basics, and apply what you learn in your classroom practice in whatever way works best for you.\n\n## Get Connected\n\nOne way to help stay motivated and focused throughout your learning is to get active in our <a href=\"http://forum.code.org/c/plc\" target=\"_new\">Professional Learning Community (PLC) forum</a>. \nStart by introducing yourself there in our <a href=\"http://forum.code.org/t/welcome-please-introduce-yourself/410\" target=\"_new\">\"Introductions\" thread</a>. Throughout the course, you'll use the forum to asynchronously share your thoughts, takeaways and questions with others who are also working through the content.\n\n<a href=\"http://forum.code.org/t/welcome-please-introduce-yourself/410/1\" target=\"blank\"><button class=\"plc\">Introduce Yourself Now >></button></a><br>\n\n## Finding Help When You Need It\n\nIf you get stuck at any time during the course, head over to [support.code.org](http://support.code.org) and check out [our community forums](https://support.code.org/hc/communities/public/topics). You'll likely find the answer to your question there. If you don't or are still stuck, you can email [teacher@code.org](mailto:teacher@code.org) and a Code.org staff member will get back to you as soon as they can.\n\n## Buddy up!\n\nKeep in mind that we are a small team and due to the scale of our efforts, we can't respond to all requests for support in the same way an instructor could for a face-to-face course. For that reason, we encourage you to ***work through this online course with a partner or group of colleagues***.\n\nCode.org recognizes the power of peer learning and collaboration. In fact, \"Pair Programming\" is a great industry practice that we'll explore in Stage 8 as a classroom best practice. If you feel you'll learn better with a partner or in a group, why not complete the course with a buddy or a colleague? If you don't know anyone in real life who's interested in partnering with you, head over to [the PLC forum](http://forum.code.org/t/never-swim-alone-the-find-a-buddy-thread/411), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/teachcode), or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1457214714576953/) and find someone from the Code.org community who might want to collaborate.\n\n## Find the learning experience that works for you\n\nFinally, online learning is not for everyone. This course has no instructor or built-in mechanism for communicating in real-time with your peers. If you find yourself needing more one-on-one attention or know you learn better in a real-world classroom where there is more opportunity for collaboration and engagement, we recommend you pursue one of our in-person professional development opportunities.\n\n<a href=\"http://code.org/professional-development-workshops\" target=\"blank\"><button>Find an in-person workshop near you >></button></a>\n\n* * *\n\n## What's your plan?\n\nTake a moment now to consider how and when you will complete this online course to ensure you get the most benefit from the experience.

You'll be challenged with a series of puzzles that need to be solved. In order to solve the puzzles, you'll have to write programs using different characters to complete different goals. We'll practice with our first puzzle in Stage 3. But before we get there, here's an overview of the different kinds of the puzzles you and your students will encounter:\n\n## Sample Maze Puzzles\n\n![](//code.org/images/mockup_birds.png)\n![](//code.org/images/pvz.png)\n\nYou'll need to get the angry bird to the pig, and you'll need to get the zombie to the sunflower.\n\n## Sample Artist Puzzle\n\n![](//code.org/images/artist.png)\n\nYou have to make the artist draw over the grey lines by moving him around the canvas. He'll draw a line behind him wherever he goes.\n\n## Sample Bee Puzzle\n\n![](//code.org/images/bee.png)\n\nYou'll need to move the bee around to collect all the nectar and make all the honey. The units of nectar and honey needed for each puzzle are written in the lower right-hand corner of each flower or honeycomb.\n\n## Play Lab\n\n![](//code.org/images/playlab.png)\n\nIn Play Lab, you'll create games and stories based on different goals.\n\n## Flappy\n\n![](//code.org/images/flappy.png)\n\nIn Flappy, you'll create your very own Flappy bird game.\nThe puzzles leading up to the game creation help you learn pieces of code you'll need for your game.\n\n## Bounce\n\n![](//code.org/images/bounce.png)\n\nIn Bounce, you get to create your own game. \nJust like in Flappy, the puzzles leading up to the game creation help you learn pieces of code you'll need for your game.\n\n* * *\n\nIn this series, we will introduce you puzzles from [CS Fundamentals](http://code.org/educate/k5). These puzzles serve as online tutorials, helping students to learn concepts like loops, events, conditionals, and functions.\n\nDuring this professional development experience, we will intersperse several puzzle progressions, giving you the chance to get familiar with the programming concepts in CS Fundamentals and the characters that your students will fall in love with. During this course, you'll notice that you move between different environments quickly; be it getting the angry bird to the pig, making a drawing, or having a bee collect nectar. These transitions happen quickly in this course to show you a range of the puzzles offered in CS Fundamentals. Your students will get to spend more time with each environment.\n\nIf you'd like to get more familiar with the student experience, you can always complete [CS Fundamentals](http://studio.code.org/) courses on your own anytime. But this course will give you a good flavor of what to expect by pulling out some of the most fundamental puzzles and lessons for you in a short amount of time.\n"

But at Code.org, we've found that some of the most impactful computer science lessons are actually \"unplugged,\" or conducted with little to no technology at all. In these lessons, students learn computer concepts without a computer.\n\nThat's why all of our CS Fundamentals courses use unplugged activities to introduce computer science concepts with physical manipulatives before students write computer programs using those concepts. An example of this would be doing a dance of repeated movements with the class to understand the concept of how loops repeat commands in a computer program. This way when the students go on to writing programs using loops, the unplugged activity has set them up with something they are already familiar with and they can relate this new concept back to that activity.\n\nWatch the video below to understand the benefits of using unplugged activities to teach computer science.\n\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://youtubeeducation.com/embed/-7lcnNcONHY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n[Download video](https://videos.code.org/levelbuilder/unplugged-whyshouldteachunpluggedactivities-mp4.mp4)\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**As you work your way through Stages 4-8**, you'll have a chance to review some of our unplugged activities for each of the core concepts covered in this course.\n"

If you answer no to any of the questions, consider revisiting the stage or exploring more about the topic in the student side of Code Studio before moving on.\n\n## Things to keep in mind while learning computer science:\n\n- The world of computer programming moves so fast that there really are no masters. **We're all learners** at different stages but we are still always learners.\n- Programming becomes more comfortable every time you come back to it. **You're not going to be an expert your first time.**\n- There's no way around it, the act of programming and **learning to program takes time, but anyone can do it!**\n\n> **Key Takeway:** The goal of the next several stages is not to turn you into a computer scientist, but to instead help you feel comfortable enough with the core concepts that you are excited to share your knowledge with your students.\n\n## After I \"master\" the concepts, what comes next?\n\nIn **Stage 9**, you'll explore Code.org's free curricula and resources for teachers. You can choose to use any of these resources or other curricular resources of your choosing. Completing this course will give you the basics you need to understand any beginning computer science curriculum.\n\nIn **Stages 10 and 11**, we'll point you in the direction of resources you can use to learn more or feel more prepared to teach these concepts in your classroom.\n"

      "markdown": "# Sequencing > Unplugged Lessons\n\nAs we mentioned, we like to introduce computer science topics with unplugged lessons. Then, we use bridging activities to transition into the online lessons later. Beginning with these unplugged lessons introduces concepts in a fun and friendly way. Then, students already feel familiar with the concept by the time that they get to the online lessons, and can relate the online lessons back to the unplugged activity.\n\nFor these programming stages that you will be going through, we will also start with examples of unplugged lessons. Read through the following lesson plan and watch the accompanying videos, thinking about how you would implement this in your classroom with your students.\n<br/>\n***\n<br/>\nWe will start with sequencing. At its base, this style of computer science is about **sequences**. A sequence is a special ordering that something follows. In these puzzles, we want to find the right sequence of instructions to tell the computer what to do. This list of instructions is called an **algorithm**.  Once that algorithm gets coded up into a language that can be read by a machine, it becomes a **program**.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n**1. Review the \"[Happy Maps](https://curriculum.code.org/csf/coursea/5/)\" Lesson Plan from Course A.**\n<br/>\nRemember that Course A is meant for Kindergarten students. Sequencing comes up in other courses, as well, and you can find examples of those lessons at the bottom of this page.\n\n<br/>\n\n**2. Watch the student video: Happy Maps**\n<br/>\nThis is a video that you would show your students to help introduce the concept of sequencing and kick off the unplugged lesson.\n\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hrnhiKAQ1_k\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n[Can't see the video? Click here](http://videos.code.org/2014/C1-happy-maps-unplugged.mp4)  \n\n<br/>\n\n**3. Watch the teacher video: How to facilitate \"Happy Maps\"**\n<br/>\nThis video is meant to be support for you as the teacher, if you are looking for tips on how to run this lesson. \n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/En6Bshuqljg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>  \n\n<br/>\n\n\n**4. Review other unplugged lessons that introduce sequencing:**\n\n- Course A (Kindergarten): [Real-Life Algorithms: Plant a Seed](https://curriculum.code.org/csf-18/coursea/3/)\n- Course B (Grade 1): [My Robotic Friends Jr.](https://curriculum.code.org/csf-18/coursea/3/), [Move It, Move It](https://curriculum.code.org/csf-18/courseb/1/)\n- Course C (Grade 2): [Paper Planes](https://curriculum.code.org/csf-18/coursec/4/)\n- Course D (Grade 3): [Graph Paper Programming](https://curriculum.code.org/csf-18/coursed/1/)\n- Course E, Course F (Grades 4, 5): [My Robotic Friends](https://curriculum.code.org/csf-18/coursee/1/)\n\n\n---\n\n\n> ## Reflect\n> How would you explain the concept of programming (including sequencing and algorithms) to your students?

This keeps everyone on the same page and makes your work in the classroom easier.\n\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/b5d9ae18a882a4359f096b9c6ade135e-image-1434398703448.jpg\" width=\"450px\" style=\"margin-right:45px; border-radius:10px;\">\n\n## Ways to act like a computer scientist:\n\n- **Be curious:** When you're curious, you do things like poke around in different menus, run pieces of code to see what happens, or check the effects of different settings. Curiosity often leads to being able to answer your own questions.\n- **Ask questions:** Collaborate with others once you've tried figuring out a problem yourself.\n- **Be persistent:** Have confidence tackling open-ended complex problems and stick with them. This becomes easier once you've written some successful programs and know how good it feels to overcome a difficult programming problem.\n- **Break big problems down into smaller, more manageable problems:** This is called **decomposing**.\n- **Read through your code:** The computer is following your instructions exactly. Tracing through code step-by-step (as if you were the computer processing the instructions) will help you find errors in your logic or missing steps.\n- **Don't feel bad about making mistakes:** Mistakes are not failure; they just bring you one step closer to creating the right solution or end product.\n- **Step away from your screen:** This can give you a much needed break and often you can come back to a problem with a new perspective.\n\n## Things to keep in mind while learning computer science:\n\n- The world of computer programming moves so fast that there really are no masters. **We're all learners** at different stages but we are still always learners.\n- Programming becomes more comfortable every time you come back to it. **You're not going to be an expert your first time.**\n- There's no way around it, the act of programming and **learning to program takes time, but anyone can do it!**\n- You can share **your own authentic experience learning to code** with your students!\n\n> ## Reflect:\n> How do you plan to create positive classroom culture when teaching computer science?

At Code.org, we suggest trying the strategic grouping strategy used in the real-world offices of the top tech firms: pair programming.\n\n>**Pair programming** is when two students use one computer to write a program together. The National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT) has a [great resource about the benefits of pair programming](http://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/resources/pairprogramming_retainingwomencollaborativelearning_practice.pdf).\n\nResearch shows that pair programming:\n\n- Leads to higher-quality student programs relative to non-paired students' programs\n- Reduces the so-called \"confidence gap\" between female and male students, while increasing the programming confidence of all students\n<br/><br/>\n\nWatch this video to understand how pair programming works, and hear directly from students how it enhances their learning.\n\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vgkahOzFH2Q\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n[Can't see the video? Click here](http://videos.code.org/2014/C1-pair-programming.mp4)\n<br/><br/>\nNot only is pair programming beneficial for students, it is also something that is practiced by some professional computer programmers.

Take a moment to consider which strategies covered in this stage you might use in your practice. In the next stage, you'll create a simple plan and reflect on the course as a whole.\n\n## What strategies will you use when facilitating computer science learning in your classroom?\n\nHere are some examples from our teacher community:\n\n- **Facilitate \"unplugged\" activities** to teach core concepts (click [here for a full list of unplugged activities](https://code.org/curriculum/unplugged.)\n- Implement the **\"ask 3 and then me\"** rule in your classroom, which is when students have to ask 3 classmates for help before they can ask the teacher that same question. This reduces the number of students that you have to answer individually and promotes peer learning.\n- **Be calm yet persistent** when problems arise (which they will.) Your reaction sets the tone for students. If at the first sign of an issue, you proclaim \"I'm terrible at technology. I give up,\" your students will think it's okay to do that too.\n- **Take pride** in their programs. Show them off, put them to work, post them online. This is a big accomplishment for you and your students that should be celebrated.\n- **Ask probing questions** to a student (even if you don't know the answer to the questions.) Ask your class if anyone has the answer. Get comfortable saying \"I don't know; let's figure this out together!\"\n\n---\n\n> ## Reflect\nReview more strategies or add your own <a href =\"http://forum.code.org/t/code-org-k5-professional-development-computer-science-pedagogy-6/14/4\">in our forums.</a>:\n\n> <a href=\"http://forum.code.org/t/code-org-k5-professional-development-computer-science-pedagogy-6/14/4\" target=\"blank\"><button class=\"plc\">Share your strategies >></button></a>\n\nAfter exploring the forum thread and adding your thoughts, click below to move on to Stage 9.\n"
