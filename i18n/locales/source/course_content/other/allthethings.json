Your responses will be saved whether you go forward or backward.\n    \n    ![](https://images.code.org/9e697f11d15376aa513dea510dd464d3-image-1463597394595.png)\n\n* You can also navigate using the bubbles at the top of the screen.\n    * Yellow - means you've visited a page but haven't answered all the questions yet.\n    * Green - means you've answered all the questions on a page.\n\n    ![](https://images.code.org/51c792652b3e922665221bba16a8c37c-image-1463598805414.png)\n\n* When you're ready to submit your test go to the LAST page and you'll see a purple \"Submit\" button. Once you click \"submit\" the test is sent to your teacher.\n\n    ![](https://images.code.org/194d1918efc8ce3f8621de4e6b2558f3-image-1463597268503.png)\n\n* Note that it is also possible to \"unsubmit\" your test.  You should **only do this in rare cases** - when you submit the test your teacher sees the time it was submitted.  \n* **Make sure** you are clear with your teacher that it's okay to unsubmit and re-submit - you don't want your entire test invalidated because you submitted after you were supposed to be done.  \n\n   ![](https://images.code.org/ab068a26c8a230a0180f6f9c5c8d45bf-image-1463600680236.png)\n\n## Good Luck!\n",
          "teacher_markdown": "### CAUTION: What this assessment is and isn't\n\n* This assessment is **designed to be in the \"style\" of the AP** multiple choice assessments.\n\n* That means the questions **are not** specifically about lessons covered prior to this point.  Rather, the questions relate to the underlying AP learning objectives that have theoretically been addressed.\n\n* It **does mean** students might need to do some extrapolation from what they've learned to answer the questions.\n\n* It **does mean** the questions might be \"hard\", especially for the first-time exposure.\n\nSo overall, **USE WITH CAUTION**\n\n* Use your judgment about what stakes to attach to this assessment.\n\t* You don't have to use this assessment to grade students, or...\n    * You can grade students in a different way than simply taking the % correct.\n\n* Ensure that you use in a way that will maintain the spirit of the class in terms of investigation of knowledge.\n\t* If you are nervous that students will get discouraged, then perhaps re-frame this assessment as an opprotunity to investigate -- let students try the questions, then go research the answers, and change what they got wrong, or develop their own set of questions.\n\n\n---\n\n#### F.A.Q. -- How to prepare, administer, and review assessments\n\nPlease see our running **[F.A.Q. document here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zEpD1PFt6ec2S8ourxuMH0HD6tiyRvqAGUKGDCOt-qs/edit#heading=h.kewgp6z8qdde)** which contains:\n\n* screenshots on how to prepare, administer, and review assessments\n* addresses common issues/problems\n\n\n#### Quick summary of how to see / review student answers\n\n1. Go to your [Teacher Dashboard](https://code.org/teacher-dashboard#/)\n2. Select your CS Principles section\n3. You'll see a number of purple tabs including Text Responses, Assessments, etc.\n4. Click **Assessments/Surveys**\n5. From the course selector dropdown, **select the unit that this assessment appeared in (e.g. Unit 1: The Internet)**\n6. For all students who have *submitted* their assessment, you will see two tables:\n   * The first table is a summary view summarizing the percentage correct from all the students who submitted, including the timestamp they submitted on\n   * The second table is a comprehensive list of each answer to each question submitted by each student\n\n    Above both of these tables is a **Download (or export) as csv** button - allowing you to process answers in a spreadsheet (recommended).\n\n7. If you need to allow a student to UNSUBMIT their test, direct the student to navigate to the last page of the test and press \"Unsubmit.\"\n\n**NOTE about UNSUBMITTING:** \n\nYou should make clear rules with your students about unsubmitting a test. Students might think this is a good way to change an answer after the test is over (i.e. cheat) but you'll see a timestamp of when the student submitted the test.  \n\nIt's suggested that you simply establish that you will not consider scoring or grading any tests after a particular time.  If it was not submitted before the specified deadline, it's like you didn't receive it.\n"
