This definition is sure to evolve and grow as the module progresses. Some possible examples for a working definition might include:\n\n-   Computer vision is like when your computer tries to figure out what's in a picture, kind of like how we recognize our friends' faces or stuff in photos\n-   Computer vision helps computers 'see' and understand the images and videos like we do, but through cameras and algorithms\n-   It's like teaching a computer to see and interpret the world around it, so it can recognize objects, people, and even actions\n-   It's a part of artificial intelligence where computers are trained to interpret and understand the visual world"

        "long_instructions": "##The Details\r\nIn healthcare, computer aided detection (CADe) and computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) refer to any applications in which a computer assists a doctor or in understanding and evaluating medical data. Within the context of computer vision, this typically means images coming from MRI, CT, X-ray, or another form of diagnostic imaging technique. However, CAD can even be (and has been) applied to camera images of faces.\r\n\r\nComputers can assist doctors in detection by identifying suspicious regions in images and alerting the physician to these concerning areas. In some cases, CADe amounts to predicting high confidence regions of interest and projecting bounding boxes for these regions onto the original image. In other cases, region of interest identification is followed by instance segmentation. In still other cases, anomaly detection may be applied to catch abnormalities.\r\n\r\nComputer-aided diagnosis takes images and other patient record information as input, and outputs evaluates the likelihood that the patient has a given disease or condition. In cancer diagnosis, for instance, this often means predicting whether a tumor is benign or malignant.\r\n\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/69283df78ff42617c6fa1dd3165f58f1-image-1719521635931.png)\r\n\r\n##Explore further\r\nTimer permitting, click this link to explore this and other computer vision solutions more in-depth: [Computer Vision in Healthcare](https://medium.com/voxel51/how-computer-vision-is-changing-healthcare-in-2023-e49d63d9922f).\r\n\r\n*What is your opinion-- is this an effective and trusted use of computer vision within the health industry?*\r\n",

        "long_instructions": "##The Details\r\nComputer vision can be used to precisely monitor the progression of a disease over time. Just as a doctor measures patient weight, height, and blood pressure during an exam, and compares these to the patient’s past measurements to assess patient health, computer vision models allow doctors to track various diseases by comparing markers in biomedical images taken at different points in time.\r\n\r\nIn some applications, progression can be monitored by precisely tracking the size of objects like cavities or lesions. More generally, computer vision applications in disease progression monitoring are characterized by a deep learning model assigning a numerical score to an image or video. These scores allow physicians to quantify the severity and time of onset for a specific patient.\r\n\r\nBy precisely monitoring progression, computer vision models can help physicians to detect the onset of a disease more rapidly. For glaucoma, a 2018 study concluded that deep learning accelerated time to detection by more than a year.\r\n\r\nWhile computer vision applications in disease monitoring primarily involve applying machine learning models to images, there are also applications involving video data. In a 2022 paper, researchers found that by evaluating the movement patterns of Parkinson’s disease patients in the act of rising from a chair, the researchers could robustly estimate disease severity. To interpret patient movement, the researchers estimated patient pose in each frame, and then quantified the velocity and smoothness of motion across video frames.\r\n\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/b05fc0fa2e91308574685f8f3d39bb7f-image-1719522066641.png)\r\n##Explore further\r\nTimer permitting, click this link to explore this and other computer vision solutions more in-depth: [Computer Vision in Healthcare](https://medium.com/voxel51/how-computer-vision-is-changing-healthcare-in-2023-e49d63d9922f).\r\n\r\n*What is your opinion-- is this an effective and trusted use of computer vision within the healthcare industry?*\r\n\r\n",

        "long_instructions": "##The Details\r\n\r\nComputer vision is deeply entrenched in the history of planning for surgery: CT scans and other forms of diagnostic imaging make possible the construction of anatomical models. This imaging data is used to generate 2D projections called templates, 3D digital reconstructions, or even 3D printed models. The models then allow surgeons to explore various approaches and entry pathways prior to surgery, minimizing time of surgery and invasiveness.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, the application of emerging technologies like deep learning and virtual reality in preoperative planning has begun to streamline surgery even further. According to a recent study involving 193 knee surgery cases, AI-based preoperative planning has the potential to reduce the average number of intraoperative corrections a surgeon needs to make by up to 50%.\r\n\r\nIn image-guided surgery, a surgeon uses this real time visual and spatial information to navigate with enhanced precision. This technology is at the heart of minimally invasive surgical (MIS) procedures. Images taken during surgery can also be fused with preoperative images in augmented reality environments.\r\n\r\nWhile still far from common, we are also beginning to see computer vision-enabled navigation, AI-driven decision making, and robotic maneuverability come together in partially and even fully autonomous robotic surgical systems.\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/64cd54d9cd1012a358d519b130bc7372-image-1719522677947.png)\r\n##Explore further\r\nTimer permitting, click this link to explore this and other computer vision solutions more in-depth: [Computer Vision in Healthcare](https://medium.com/voxel51/how-computer-vision-is-changing-healthcare-in-2023-e49d63d9922f).\r\n\r\n*What is your opinion-- is this an effective and trusted use of computer vision within the healthcare industry?*\r\n\r\n",

        "bubble_choice_description": "Johanna Jaskowska’s hyper-shiny, highlight-perfect Instagram face filters have experienced viral success since the beginning of this year. ",
        "long_instructions": "##How do you describe what you do?\r\nI’m a weird hybrid creative, but ‘digital creative’ is the umbrella that captures all the skills I use. I have a design and art direction background so I can do a bit of everything, including some developing, focusing on new media and technologies and innovations. My main focus, though, is concept: if there’s no story, none of the work makes sense. I find a lot of brands get into using augmented reality (AR) but they don't always understand the purpose of these technologies.\r\n\r\n##How did you go about creating your first filters?\r\nWhen I published my first filter, I had to shape the face of the users in a plastic material in order to cast light on the face. From the users feedback I realised that the thing that folks were talking about was the plastic effect. It says a lot about society (smooth skin, perfect, the idea that everything has to be sleek without imperfection). It also really attracts the eye, like looking at the reflection of water.\r\n\r\nI thought ‘OK I’ll make the 100% plastic face filter.’ That’s how I got the idea to make Beauty 3000, I just exaggerated it. And when I did it, I was really surprised with the result, even on my own face. It’s important to understand social media and how people use it, so if you hide the face people don’t have the space to tell the story of themselves, and people like to talk about themselves.\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/1f838b37f886de8d45ad48f63ddc64c4-image-1719432734642.png)\r\n\r\n##Have you had any surprising moments since the filters went viral?\r\nIt was very intense – I didn’t expect any of it and I had to learn a lot. The social media pressure was overwhelming, so many people contacted me for interviews, work or features, it was too much and it was very difficult to handle everything. I was trying to respond to everyone but I realised I needed to think about myself, so I slowed down and I’m learning to say no...\r\n\r\nWhat I find so fascinating with AR is when it’s actually impossible in real life – you can play with physics, textures, you can wear imagery or a dress that is like wood or water.\r\n\r\n##How useful were your studies to the work you do now?\r\nI had a hard time after my studies when I was looking for a ‘real job’ to define myself as either a designer or art director or developer. I didn’t want to be categorised. I chose the digital field because I'm very curious and I knew the field would continue to fascinate me and that there would always be something new. I knew I’d be captivated and have food for my brain.",

        "long_instructions": "##How would you describe what you do as Creative Technologist?\r\nAs a creative technologist, I’m interested in the intersection between art and technology. I create immersive sensory experiences to better engage and reconnect people, including those with disabilities. I explore new perspectives in Human-Computer Interaction especially concerning how the body can be an interface to learning and creativity.\r\n\r\nMovement and dance are important elements of my practice, they are some of the most liberating ways to express our feelings. I’ve created a series of web experiments exploring the relationship between movement and machine, in which you can use your body as a musical instrument. I had the chance to showcase my work at the Secret Art Gallery and many other galleries in London with the participation of talented dancers.\r\n\r\n##Can you tell us about some of your favourite projects to date?\r\nA project I was proud to be part of was the launch of the AW22 collection for Zara. With the engineering and design team, I created an immersive pop-up... The installation presents a video projection of the new products, which you can interact with. The type of interaction I've explored with machine learning [computer vision] is called image recognition. Depending on the pose you’re making, it shows different articles of clothing projected onto your body.\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/94607b1b909617ed1319ec7f0c42573c-image-1719433556278.png)\r\n\r\n##What skills or traits are most essential to the role?\r\nI did an MSc in Creative Computing to have a solid base in coding and understand which [programming languages] I would like to use and develop in my art. It’s also important to always be open to learning new programming languages because things move fast in the tech world, and new forms of creativity can appear at any time.\r\n\r\nI knew from the beginning that art was my passion. Since I was a kid, I was already painting and making music in the Swiss countryside. But I also gravitated toward math and science because I loved the logic and feeling of progressive problem-solving.\r\n\r\n",

        "long_instructions": "##How would you describe what you do?\r\nIn my design practice, I am the co-founder as well as creative and tech producer at Ricebox Studio, which I run alongside three of my friends – Anna Tsuda, Safiya Ahmed and Bristy Azmi. We’re called Ricebox because all four of us are from different Asian backgrounds (Japanese, Indian, Bengali, Vietnamese) and rice is our common cultural staple! Our mission is to use creative tech and design for social good, and we start conversations on important topics like sustainability and racism through alternative methods of communication. I’m also a part-time digital designer at Child Rights International Network (CRIN), where I work alongside policymakers and researchers to advocate for children’s rights in creative and accessible ways.\r\n\r\n##What are you working on lately?\r\nBeing a designer... built up my understanding of the current discussions and initiatives surrounding social issues on an international scale. That’s informed Ricebox projects like MUCChase – the AR treasure hunt about fast fashion and sustainability that we developed for the Responsive Fashion Institute – and On Your Side UK, the UK’s first national helpline service for East and Southeast Asian victims of hate crimes and racism, which we shaped the user experience and user interface for.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, my personal ‘sandbox’ of solo projects has really expanded my practice too... creative tech has allowed me to try out new techniques for fun, such as 3D-scanning when creating a video for the musician SpiderPlant. My personal experience as an augmented reality (AR) Instagram filter designer has also fed into how I use AR within storytelling and activism, especially at Ricebox Studio.\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/0929f6903497f2b8d8a1adff428a075d-image-1719434122475.png)\r\n\r\n##Would you say you need any specific training for what you do?\r\nYes and no. I graduated with a BA in Graphic Design, which taught me essential design principles, approaches to conceptual development and ways of pitching to clients. However, my skills in creative technologies were really a mix of formal and informal training.\r\n\r\nAR was self-taught – in fact, the majority of AR designers I know did not undergo formal training; we all used YouTube tutorials, plus we swapped advice and troubleshooting tips on Facebook groups.\r\n\r\nGenerative AI, programming, web development and physical computing were a mix. I started off trying to learn it all on my own, but it was an absolute car crash! I lacked diligence, was so confused and had a messy approach to troubleshooting, so I took to learning from people and enrolling in online courses instead. ",
