If your test was successful, move on to the next level. If not, try some of the troubleshooting steps\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nThere are a number of things that could prevent your test from passing.\n\n1.  Try refreshing the page and running the test again (you should refresh the page for each of the following ideas as well)\n2.  Try connecting your board to a different USB port\n3.  Try a different USB cable. Some USB cables can only be used for charging, so make sure your cable supports data transfer!\n4.  Try a different board\n5.

This can be an opportunity to gain insights and offer feedback on the skills students demonstrate while building their app, even if they do not finish the level completely. This type of level can also reinforce the Problem Solving Process as students ideate and develop an app of their own choosing (Define - Prepare - Try - Reflect).\r\n\r\nAs students develop more skills throughout the unit, they may decide to use an idea from this level as the basis for one of their projects or to continue developing on their own time."

Students should understand that arrays are intended to hold several pieces of information, usually all of the same type.  Just like any other piece of information, it needs to be assigned to a variable for a programmer to find it again.  Programmers can access each element of the array by its **index**, or its position number in the array.  Students will have a chance to practice the exact syntax in the lesson."

    "teacher_markdown": "**Why Are We Talking Pins?** You may notice that in the early levels of this lesson students are programming in a much different way than they have before, directly manipulating pins. The `digitalWrite()` and `pinMode()` commands are useful to get our wiring set up quickly, but are not the core concerns of this lesson. As soon as students are comfortable wiring LED circuits we will introduce techniques to control those LEDs with the higher level commands that have been used up to this point (like `led.on()` and `led.off()`).",

The first LED for `\"A4\"` has been setup for you and uses the familiar [`led.on()`(#f78183)][3] block, but replaces `led` with the variable name.

In this lesson, we'll see how you can use external components for **inputs**, like creating your own button \"up\" and \"down\" events.\n\nWe'll start by using two wires connected to the `\"A0\"` and `\"GND\"` pins, like in the diagram to the right. When the wires are disconnected, it represents an \"up\" event or that the button isn't being pressed. When the wires are connected, it represents a \"down\" event or that the button has been pressed.\n\n# Do This\n\n<img src=\"https://cdo-curriculum.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/button_alligator.png\" style=\"width: 200px; margin: 10px; float: right;\" />\n\n1.  Make sure your Circuit Playground is disconnected from the computer\n2.  Grab two wires.\n3.  Connect one wire to the pin `\"A0\"`.\n4.  Connect the second wire to a `\"GND\"` pin.\n5.  Plug in your Circuit Playground. You may need to re-run the Maker Setup to make sure the board connects correctly.\n\n**Run the program!** With the program running, touch the unconnected ends of both wires together to \"press\" the button. When you do, the Circuit Playground should buzz!",

This happens in two parts:\n\n1.  A [`createButton()`(#4dd0e1)][1] block lets you assign an external button to a variable\n2.  An [`onBoardEvent()`(#f78183)][2] block uses the same variable name to detect button events like `up` and `down`\n\nRight now, the Circuit Playground makes a low-buzz when the wires touch for a `down` event. Let's add another event to make the Circuit Playground make a high-buzz when the wires release for an `up` event.\n\n# Do This\n\n<div markdown=\"1\" style=\"float: right; margin: 20px;\">\n\n[expandable][3]\n\n<br/>\n\nClick to Expand\n\n</div>\n\n1.  Use an [`onBoardEvent()`(#f78183)][4] to detect when the `buzzButton` is released `up`\n    -   Add an [`onBoardEvent()`(#f78183)][5] block to your code\n    -   In the first parameter, do not select any of the options from the dropdown. Instead, type in `buzzButton`\n    -   In the second parameter, select \"up\" from the list of options\n2.  When the `buzzButton` is released: make a high-pitched buzz\n    -   Inside the [`onBoardEvent()`(#f78183)][6]: \n        -   Use the [`buzzer.frequency()`(#f78183)][7] block to play a high-pitched buzz\n\nRun the program!

Using other conductive materials, like paperclips or aluminum foil or metal tabs, we can simulate buttons or switches like we're more familiar with. This requires creating a situation where our two wires are close but not touching, then the user interacts with a third physical device which connects the two wires together simulating a button press.\r\n\r\n## Do This\r\n\r\n**Prepare:**\r\n\r\n- Decide how you'd like to setup your button or switch. \r\n\t- You can search the internet for \"DIY Switch\" or \"DIY Button\"\r\n    - Or, you can check out this guide from [Red Fern Electronics: DIY Switches](https://redfernelectronics.co.uk/diy-switches/)\r\n\r\n**Materials:**\r\n\r\n- Gather your conductive materials and wires together\r\n- Arrange your wires so they are close by, but not touching\r\n- Arrange your third conductive material so it can be pressed or toggled or moved to bridge the two other wires\r\n- Try to hide your wires as much as possible so only the button or switch is visible\r\n- Get your Circuit Playground ready\r\n\r\n**In Code Mode:**\r\n\r\n1) Create a button variable\r\n2) When the button is pressed: make a noise or light up\r\n3) Attach your wires to your circuit playground and test your code\r\n\r\n**Run Your Code!** You should be able to press your button or toggle your switch like it's a real button or switch.",
