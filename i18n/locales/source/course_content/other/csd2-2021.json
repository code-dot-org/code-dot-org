For now, they do not need to worry about every button, as they will be explained later, but they should understand that the inspector tool helps them to link parts of the web page with code that created them, and the refresh and save button allows them to update their webpage if it does not automatically update when they change the code.\n\nAlthough it's not part of the video, the instructions pane will also often include drop down questions and answers that students can use when they are completing an activity, and in some levels the tabs at the top of the instructions pane will take students to a \"Help and Tips\" area that includes reference information relevant to the activities."

The discussion prompts listed in the level should be used in a standard Think-Pair-Share structure.\n\n-   What text is appearing in both the code and the web page?\n-   How is this language communicating extra information about the way to represent text?\n\nThe goal of the discussion is to call out the features of HTML that students are noticing.

Talking about the organization, structure, or role of the content in the page (heading, paragraph, list, etc.) is more accurate than talking about specific aspects of its appearance (such as size or spacing).  \n\nAlthough certain structural roles may be associated with appearance (headings are larger), HTML does not specify anything in particular about the appearance.  This allows users with different needs, such as the visually impaired, to interact with the structured content in a way that makes the most sense for them.  Later in the unit, students will learn about styles and CSS, which allows them to specify exact size, color, and spacing to their HTML elements.\n\nThe paragraph tag separates text into paragraphs.  You may want to follow up this question by asking students how they think a web browser for the blind might deal with paragraphs.  For example, while sighted people may use spacing and new lines to separate out paragraphs, what should a screen reader do?"

Paragraphs in HTML can be any length of text from one word to a bunch of sentences. All of your text in your web page should be contained in an HTML element (headings or paragraphs). Paragraphs group together sets of sentences and put some space between that group of text and the next group of text.\n\n:::\n\n::: details [**How do I create multiple paragraphs?**]\n\nParagraphs are marked by opening (`<p>`) and closing (`</p>`) tags as well. To create more than one paragraph you will want multiple sets of opening and closing `<p>` tags. For example\n\n        <p>\n            This is a paragraph.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            This is another paragraph.\n        </p>\n\n:::\n\n::: details [**What are headings?**]\nHeadings are the different sized section titles throughout a web page. Headings add structure to your web page by breaking it up so it's easier for a user to read.\n:::\n\n::: details [**How do I make different sized headings?**]\nHeadings come in 6 different sizes. So far you have primarily used the biggest one `<h1>`. The number 1 in the HTML tag designates that this is the biggest heading. The smallest heading is `<h6>`. You can also try the `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, and `<h5>` tags which get smaller as the number gets larger.\n:::\n\n::: details [**What is HTML?**]\nHTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is used to add structure to the content of a web page. HTML uses tags to specify where certain structures start and end. These tags are sets of characters not found in the English language so that the content and structure can be differentiated. \n:::\n\n::: details [**What is an HTML element?**]\nAn HTML element is a piece of a website that is marked by a start tag and sometimes closed with an end tag. The element also includes the content inside the tags. For example: \n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/fb4df62aa4d879f7021c567be2e28eea-image-1481135855001.png\" style=\"width:500px\">\n:::\n\n::: details [**What is an HTML tag?**]\n\nAn HTML tag is the special set of characters that tells the machine where the start or end of an HTML element is and what type it is.\n\n:::\n\n</div>\n\nThe author of this page added in a lot of content, but did not think about structure.  All of the text is mashed together.\n\nDo This:\n\n-   Look through the content with your partner and decide what you think the best structure should be.\n-   Use your heading and paragraph tags to code the structure into the page.",

    "teacher_markdown": "## Discussion Goals\n\n**Key Vocabulary**\n\n-   **CSS** - Cascading Style Sheets; a language used to describe how HTML elements should be styled\n-   **CSS Selector** - the part of a CSS rule-set that defines which HTML elements the style should be applied to\n\nStudents should understand that the structure of the page is there to organize the information in a logical way, but doesn't tell the computer how to display it.  So, for example, the structure could include different headings and paragraphs, but would say nothing about the color of text or how big it is displayed.  The style of the page is the specifics of its appearance.  Without a particular style, each web browser would decide how to display different web page elements on their own.\n\nStyles are important to allow web developers to decide exactly how a web page looks on the screen.  Because styles are separate from structure and content, web developers can change the style of an entire page very easily, without having to make any changes to the structure and content of the web page.  This means that it's very easy for web pages to have an individual look and feel that is unified across the entire page.\n\n**Images in the Video**\n\nAround the 40 second mark, the video briefly mentions that students have learned how to add images to their website. In a previous version of the curriculum when this video was originally recorded, students learned images before learning CSS. In the current version of the curriculum, students haven't learned how to add images to their webpages (yet). It's a small moment in the video, but if students ask about it, use the moment to build excitement since students will be learning about images in just a few lessons!"

External style sheets are separate files that are linked to the HTML page.\n:::\n\n::: details [**What is CSS?**]\n\nCSS is a language that controls the way content on a web site appears.  It uses rule-sets to change the look of a page.  Each rule set has a selector, which specifies which elements on the page will be affected, and the rules, which explain how to display the elements.

Your file should always end in the \".css\" extension.\n:::\n\n::: details [**How do I rename a file?**]\nTo rename a file, you can right click (or control click) on the file name and choose the \"Rename\" option.  This will allow you to type in a new file name.  Clicking on a file name after it is already highlighted will also allow you to rename the file.\n:::\n\n::: details [**How do I add a style sheet to a web page?**]\n\nTo add a style sheet to a web page, open up the code for the web page.

Then change \"style.css\" to the name of your style sheet.\n\n:::\n\n</div>\n\n# Style this page!\n\nHere is an opportunity to be creative and have some fun with styles.\n\n# Do this\n\n-   Link the stylesheet to the web page.\n-   Make the paragraph text a different size.\n-   Make the paragraph text a different color.",

The first value is how much the shadow will be shifted horizontal and the second value will be how much the shadow will be shifted vertically. And if you want, you can change the color along with other properties.

It’s the size of a single point of light on the screen.\r\n\r\n\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**Why doesn't <code>text-shadow: 0px 0px;</code> do anything?**]\r\n\r\nMost properties have default values.  The default values are the styles that an element will have automatically, before you add your style sheet.  The default value for `text-shadow` is `0px 0px`, so it doesn't change from how it already looked.\r\n\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**What are the possible values for text shadow??**]\r\n\r\nYou can choose between negative and positive numbers. Negative numbers move the shadow either left or up while positive numbers move the shadow to the right or down.\r\n\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**Why do I need all the punctuation?**]\r\n\r\nThe punctuation, such as the curly braces `{}`, the colon `:`, and the semicolon `;`, help the computer to understand the rules in the style sheet.  The curly braces hold all the rules for a particular selector.  Each rule should end in a semicolon, and the properties and values are always separated by a colon.\r\n\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**What is a style sheet?**]\r\n\r\nA style sheet is a document that controls how a web page will appear.

It uses rule-sets to change the look of a page.  Each rule set has a selector, which specifies which elements on the page will be affected, and the rules, which explain how to display the elements.   Each rule consists of a property and a value for that property.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nHere’s an example of a rule-set that makes the text in an `h2` tag blue and cursive:\r\n\r\n```\r\nh2 {\r\n   color: blue;\r\n   font-family: cursive;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, `h2` is the selector, `color` and `font-family` are properties, and `blue` and `cursive` are the values for those properties.\r\n:::\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n# Text Shadow\r\n\r\nThe `text-shadow` property sets a shadow for the text elements.\r\n\r\n* Find the CSS code that is giving the letters in \"Stradivarius Violins\" a shadow in the `h1` tag.\r\n* Give the `h2` tag a shadow spaced two pixels to the right and up from the original text.\r\n* Give a text shadow to other tags as well.\r\n"

RGB uses _additive color mixing_.  In additive color mixing, red and green make yellow, red and blue make magenta, and blue and green make cyan.  When you mix the three primary colors together (red, green, and blue), they make white.

If there is no period, it means that the selector is the name of an HTML tag.\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**Why would a web developer use classes?**]\r\nA web developer uses classes when some elements should be styled differently than others, even if they are the same tag.  Classes can also be used to give elements that have different tags the same style.\r\n:::\r\n\r\n::: details [**I used different RGB values, but mine work, too.**]\r\n\r\nBecause RGB creates millions of different colors, some are so similar that people have a hard time telling them apart.

A bigger radius makes a bigger, softer curve, and a smaller radius makes a smaller, sharper curve.  A radius of zero makes a regular corner.  You can read more about this property at <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_border-radius.asp\" target=\"_new\">W3Schools - CSS3 border-radius property</a>\n\n:::\n\n::: details [**What does the float property do?**]\n\nThe `float` property makes an element \"float\", meaning that the elements that come after it all flow around it.  If the `float` value is `left`, the element will float to the left, and the elements after it will show up on its right.  If the `float` value is `right`, the element will float to the right, and the elements after it will show up on its left.

It specifies which elements will have to follow the rules inside the curly braces, in this case, the body element is the entire page.\n-   `background-color: lightblue;` is the rule that makes the entire page light blue.\n    -   `background-color` is the _property_.  It explains what the rule is about, in this case the color of the background.\n    -   `lightblue` is the _value_.  It explains how the rule should be applied, in this case making the background light blue.\n\n:::\n\n::: details [**What colors can I use in CSS?**]\n\nCSS includes most common color names (red, blue, green, etc.), and many uncommon ones.  You can see a full list of CSS color names at <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp\" target=\"_new\">W3Schools - HTML Color Names</a>.  You can still use colors that are not included in the named list, but you will need to use their RGB values.

You can read more about the property at <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-color.asp\" target=\"_new\">W3Schools - CSS background-color Property</a>\n\n:::\n\n::: details [**What if an element inside the page has a different background color from the body?**]\n\nYou can see the answer to this question by adding a `background-color` rule to the `p` tag.  The paragraphs will have the background color in the rule for the `p` tag, and the rest of the page will follow the rule for the `body` tag.\n\n:::\n\n::: details [**What is a style sheet?**]\n\nA style sheet is a document that controls how a web page will appear.  External style sheets are separate files that are linked to the HTML page.\n\n:::\n\n::: details [**What is CSS?**]\n\nCSS is a language that controls the way content on a web site appears.  It uses rule-sets to change the look of a page.  Each rule set has a selector, which specifies which elements on the page will be affected, and the rules, which explain how to display the elements.   Each rule consists of a property and a value for that property.\n\nHere’s an example of a rule-set that makes the text in an `h2` tag blue and cursive:\n\n    h2 {\n      color: blue;\n      font-family: cursive;\n    }\n\nIn this example, `h2` is the selector, `color` and `font-family` are properties, and `blue` and `cursive` are the values for those properties.\n\n:::\n\n</div>\n\n# Background Color\n\n-   Find the code in the style sheet that is making the background of the entire page light blue.\n-   Change the code to make the page a different color.\n-   Try to change the background color of just the paragraphs."

External style sheets are separate files that are linked to the HTML page.\n\n:::\n\n::: details [**What is CSS?**]\n\nCSS is a language that controls the way content on a web site appears.  It uses rule-sets to change the look of a page.  Each rule set has a selector, which specifies which elements on the page will be affected, and the rules, which explain how to display the elements.   Each rule consists of a property and a value for that property.\n\nHere’s an example of a rule-set that makes the text in an `h2` tag blue and cursive:\n\n    h2 {\n       color: blue;\n       font-family: cursive;\n    }\n\nIn this example, `h2` is the selector, `color` and `font-family` are properties, and `blue` and `cursive` are the values for those properties.\n\n:::\n\n</div>\n\n# The Body Element\n\n-   Find the `body` rule-set in the style sheet.\n-   Discuss with a partner what you think will happen if you add `text-align`, `color`, or other text properties to the `body` rule set.\n-   Try out some different properties to check your guesses."

The location of a local page is just the file path for that page. <br> <br>\n\nFor example to link to the unique houses page you would add the following code inside your `<body>` element. <br><br>\n\n    <a href=\"houses.html\"> Unique Houses </a>\n\n:::\n\n::: details [**How do I add a hyperlink?**]\n\nYou can <strong>add hyperlinks to your web page using the `<a>` element</strong>.

To practice, let's split the content on this sample page into two pages and link them together.\n\n# Do This\n\n-   Add a new HTML file by clicking  [][0].  The new file will appear in the files list on the left side of the workspace.\n-   Rename the file, either by right clicking it and choosing \"Rename\", or by clicking on it when it's already highlighted.  **Make sure the name is unique, descriptive and ends in \".html\"**.\n-   Use HTML to fill out your new page. (You can use content from the main page.)\n-   Link to your new page from \"index.html\"\n-   Link back to the index from your new page.",
