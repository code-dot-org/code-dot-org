The most important aspect for students to understand is that sprites allow them to organize a lot of information about something that they want to draw to the screen.  \n\nStudents should make the connection between properties and variables, that both hold information that their program needs to run.  Properties are accessed through their sprites, and Game Lab sprites already have specific properties that are automatically created when students create each sprite, such as x position, height, and rotation.  \n\nSprites solve the problem of organizing a lot of information about how something should be drawn to a screen.  Rather than creating new variables to hold all of that information, sprites use properties to hold all of the information about one thing that is drawn to the screen.\n\n**Content Corner:** The sprite is a type of data called an **object**. While we aren't yet explicitly introducing the concept of objects, students do need to understand that a sprite is a different type of value from the ones we've seen before, one that can hold references to many more values."

Students may be confused by the use of the word \"animation\" for single images, but in Game Lab, still images are considered \"animations\" with only one frame.\n\nStudents can use an animation already in the animation tab library, upload one from their computer, or create their own using the provided drawing tools.  Additionally, students can use the drawing tools to modify the images they have chosen from the library or uploaded.\n\n### Misconception Alert!\n\nMany students may now confuse the concepts of a sprite, its animation, and the image that it draws to the screen.  In the next few lessons, watch out for this misconception, and reinforce the idea that a sprite's animation is just one of its properties, the one that controls what image is drawn to the screen.  Remind students that a single sprite may have different animations throughout the course of the program, just as other properties can change, and that two or more sprites might share the same animation."

This creates an animation effect by changing what is a drawn by a small amount each time the draw function runs. This can be compared to a physical flip book, which can animate an image by changing it slightly on each page.\n\n### Misconception Alert!\n\nWhen the draw loop runs, it does not \"clear\" out previous drawing, so it will continue to show anything that has not been covered up by the new draw loop.  If students do not add a \"background\" at the beginning of the draw loop, they will still see all the images drawn to the screen previously."

    "teacher_markdown": "## Discussion Goals\n\nStudents may describe the counter patten in various ways.  Make sure that they go beyond just stating the blocks or code that the counter pattern uses.  They should understand that the counter pattern allows the programmer to update the value of a variable in a pattern that counts up (or down) on every iteration of the draw loop.  This can be used for many different things, such as spinning, growing, shrinking, or timers, but it's most often used to move sprites across the screen.\n\nWhen a sprite's x or y property is updated in a counter pattern, its position changes in a consistent way over time, causing it to move across the screen.  Students should be able to explain that movement in an animation is just a change in position, and that changing a sprite's x position will cause it to move horizontally, and changing a sprite's y position will cause it to move vertically."

Adding to or removing from a sprite's `x` or `y` property in the draw loop makes your sprite move just a bit each time it is redrawn.\n\n# Do This\n\n-   Read the code that makes the jet go up the screen.\n-   Add code that makes the plane move to the right, as in the sample image."

    "teacher_markdown": "## Discussion Goals\n\nThe broad point of this question is that programmers use if statements when they want the program to run differently in response to different situations.  Encourage students to think of particular situations in which this would be the case.  For example, they might want their characters to move faster when a \"bonus\" is in effect, or maybe they want more enemies to appear when the player reaches a certain level.  Maybe they want the program to react in some way if a user presses a key or clicks the mouse, or they want a character to change animations if it touches a particular item."

The immediate answer is that the velocity block allows a programmer to set the velocity at the beginning of the program and not have to worry about the counter pattern inside the draw loop (as Game Lab will take care of that).  If students are having trouble of thinking of situations in which the velocity block provides a big advantage, assure them that they will tackle some problems in the coming lesson that they will need this block for.\n\nAs students give you examples, try to elicit answers that use both positive and negative numbers, and that use the x and y positions as well as sprite rotation."
