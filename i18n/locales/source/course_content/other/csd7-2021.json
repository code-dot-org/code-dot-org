You can click-and-drag each box to move them around the screen.\n\nTry to group boxes together in any way that makes sense to you. You could compare individual rows of numbers to other boxes, or compare numbers within the box itself - whatever makes sense to you.\n\n# Do This\n\n-   Drag the boxes around the screen so you have at least 3 different groups (you can have more if you'd like!)\n-   Once you have your groups, click the \"Next\" button to reveal what each box represents.\n-   Once you've revealed the boxes, see if you can summarize your groups to another person."

The higher the value, the bigger the food is.\n-   **Hardness**: How hard the food is. The higher the value, the harder the food is (usually because of a rind or shell)\n-   **Easy to Eat**: How easy the food is to eat. The higher the value, the easier it is to just pick up the food and eat it\n-   **Juiciness**: How juicy the food is. The higher the value, the juicier the food is.\n-   **Sweetness**: How sweet the food is. The higher the value, the sweeter the food is.\n-   **Can Smell It**: How fragrant the food is. The higher the value, the more the food smells (like onions)\n-   **Green-ness**: How green the food is on the outside. The higher the value, the greener the food is (like watermelon or limes)\n-   **Stackability**: How easy it is to stack the food into a pile. The higher the value, the easier it is to stack the food on one another without them rolling away or squishing.\n    :::\n\n## Do This\n\nUsing the dropdowns to adjust the features, draw a line that creates a model that correctly classifies at least 80% of the fruits and 80% of the veggies\n\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/7c501f5e08f2cb06b5ddc5c1aae26f31-image-1625704907103.png\" width=\"200px\">",
