Another way HTML allows you to organize your code is by using **headings**.

Use the ideas that you wrote down a couple lessons ago, and decide what this page will be about.  You'll have a chance to make other pages later.\n\nDraw a sketch of your web page, including headings and paragraphs that it includes. Show your sketch to your partner and explain which tags you will use for the different parts of the page.  You can look at the previous levels if you've forgotten what the different tags are, or ask your partner for help.\n\nIf you've sketched something you haven't learned how to code yet, you can save it for later.\n\n## Try\n\nUse the HTML you've learned to create your page.  You can ask a partner to help you if you get stuck, but **you are the driver** for your own web page, meaning you should be typing in all the code yourself.\n\n## Reflect\n\nOnce you have finished your web page, compare it to your sketch to make sure you didn't forget anything.

That means you need to pay attention to spelling, capitalization, and the file extension. Each of the three images on this page is broken because of an improper `src` attribute. Using the file menu for reference, fix each of the image tags.\n\n_Note: Even though the images are not loading properly, our website is still showing descriptive text of what should be there because we used `alt` attributes.

CSS allows each HTML element to be styled according to certain set of rules.\n* **CSS Selector** - Specifies the part of the code which the style should be applied to.\n\n## Introduced Code\n\n*  **[Color](//studio.code.org/docs/weblab/color/)** - `color: value;`\n*  **[Text Align](//studio.code.org/docs/weblab/text-align/)** - `text-align: value;`\n*  **[Text Decoration](//studio.code.org/docs/weblab/Text-Dec/)** - `text-decoration: value;`\n*  **[Font Family](//studio.code.org/docs/weblab/font-family/)** - `font-family:value;`\n*  **[Font Size](//studio.code.org/docs/weblab/font-size/)** - `font-size:value;`\n\n"

While they have previously been using HTML tags to label and categorize their content, they're now learning how to control the style of the different elements in their page using CSS. Students may have some misconceptions at this point since their browser has used default styles for their different kinds of content (e.g. `<h1>` tags by default make text larger). As they move through these lessons they should come to see that tagging content really just allows the browser's default styles, or the styles they define using CSS, to be applied to the correct pieces of content in their web pages."

Each rule consists of a property and a value for that property.\n\nHere’s an example of a rule-set that makes the text in an `h2` tag blue and cursive:\n\n<pre>h2 {\n   color: blue;\n   font-family: cursive;\n</pre>\n\nIn this example, `h2` is the selector, `color` and `font-family` are properties, and `blue` and `cursive` are the values for those properties.\n\n</details>\n\n</details>\n</div>\n\n# Text Alignment\n\nThe `text-align` property sets the horizontal (side to side) position of the text within each line.\n\n-   Find the \"text-align\" property in the paragraph tag.\n-   Change the paragraph alignment.\n    -   Choose from \"left\", \"right\", and \"center\""

While there is a common specification for how HTML and CSS should be read and displayed on the screen, each browser does so in a slightly different way, which can lead to the same page looking different on different computers. If your students encounter this, you can reassure them that it's a common challenge that web developers face.\n\nIn the case of `font-family: fantasy`, you can actually specify a list of fonts, from most to least specific. That way, if a user's computer has the exact font you specified, that's what they'll see, but if not the browser will try the next font on your list. To try and ensure that users see the font in the example image, you could write the css as `font-family: Papyrus, fantasy`. That way, even if a user's browser has a different default font for \"fantasy\", it will try to load the specific font \"Papyrus\" first."
