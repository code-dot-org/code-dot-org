      "markdown": "# Innovation Research\n\nChoose one of the following topics to look into. You'll want to find information about some of the most recent innovative computing devices related to your category.\n\n## Wearable Technology\nWearable technology includes any form of computing that is designed to be worn by the user, whether it's embedded into the clothing or worn as an accessory. Many wearables, such as smart pedometers, overlap somewhat with health and safety as the device is both wearable _and_ intended to help improve your personal health.\n\n## Health and Safety\nThe broad range topic includes both consumer technology (things that you might use to improve your health or safety) and professional technology (gear that a doctor or other professional might use).\n\n## Agriculture\nAgriculture might not be an obvious topic, but technological innovations have had a huge impact on how we approach farming. This includes incorporating computers into existing farm equipment, using sensors and robotics to monitor crops, and analyzing data to improve efficiency and sustainability.\n\n## Manufacturing\nAdvancements in rapid prototyping, industrial robotics, and automation have had a major impact on how goods are produced. Whether it's technology to enable affordable small-scale manufacturing (like 3D printers and laser cutters) or the integration of computers into factory work, there are many interesting areas to research here.\n\n## Art and Design\nThe intersection of artistic expression and computing can yield impressive and unexpected results. While you are less likely to find commercially available products related to art and design, you will find a wide variety of homemade creations that use all manners of computing devices in creative and expressive ways.\n\n## Smart Home\nThe dream of a house that understands and even anticipates your needs is closer than ever. Whether controlled explicitly through voice commands, or by using sensors to monitor and respond to changing conditions, smart home devices take care of any number of mundane or repetitive tasks around the house.\n\n\n# Research Considerations\n\nAs you research devices on your topic, keep the following considerations in mind:\n\n* Focus on hardware based solutions over software programs\n* Focus on recent innovations over old news\n* Follow what interests you\n\nIn addition to the recommended sites listed for each topic, consider looking towards the various crowd funding websites (such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo) to see the products that haven't quite made it off the ground yet.\n\n",

Fortunately, we can use the `randomNumber` block to do just that.\n\n# Do This\n\nInstead of setting the \"x\" and \"y\" properties to a specific number, use the `randomNumber` block to pick a new random \"x\" and \"y\" each time the smiley is clicked.\n\n_Tip: The App Lab screen is 320 pixels wide by 450 pixels tall.

The `threshold` property allows you to set how much a sensor should change before considering it a \"change\" event - so setting `soundSensor.threshold = 100` would cause the sound sensor's \"change\" event only to trigger if its value increased or decreased by at least 100.\n\n# Do This\n\nThis app changes the background color of the screen whenever the sound sensor value changes, but we want to only respond to big changes in volume (like a loud noise). Use the `soundSensor.threshold` block to fix it.\n\n-   Add a `soundSensor.threshold` block before the event handler\n-   Test out which how different threshold values impact the \"change\" event\n-   Choose a threshold value that makes the screen background change only when a loud noise is sensed.\n\n_Tip: Your threshold depends on how much ambient noise there is in the room, and how much it changes.

Can you find code that is repeated multiple places, or chunks of code that could be better understood of given a name? Don't forget that you can use parameters to write functions for repeated code that is _mostly_ the same, but varies a bit (such as setting color on multiple LEDs)."
