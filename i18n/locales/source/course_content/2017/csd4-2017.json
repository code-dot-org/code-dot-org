This allows the app to gradually narrow down the decision one question at a time. This type of app can be really useful to help users understand complex processes - for example, you might introduce a recycling program by using a decision tree app to help users figure out which bin to sort items into - first asking what material it's made out of, then whether it is clean or not, and so on.\n\n# Functionality Missing from this Prototype\n\n-   Question buttons don't direct you to different screens\n-   The final screen doesn't give you a recommended decision"

This is particularly troublesome when students leave the default screen ID \"screen1\"\n-   Conflicting element IDs: If students have _properly_ namespaced all of their elements this shouldn't be an issue, but any elements that have the default ID or share an ID with an existing element will prevent a screen from importing\n\nOnce teams move to the programming phase of this project, it becomes much more difficult for students to collaborate on the same app. The design phase is the primary opportunity for all students to collaborate on the app - after this teams will still be working together, but each student will be working on their own copy of the app."

    "teacher_markdown": "#### Just the Facts\n\nThere's a lot to consume here and many of the details about how events work in App Lab are not totally necessary to understand for our needs in this unit. If students are struggling with how programming works in App Lab, focus on these essentials:\n\n-   There is no `draw` loop that runs forever\n-   The `onEvent()` block specifies:\n    -   an element ID\n    -   an event (such as \"click\" or \"mouseover\")\n    -   code that should be run when the event occurs (this code is technically an anonymous callback function, represented by the green block)\n-   Code inside `onEvent()` blocks runs any time the specified event occurs\n\n#### Compared to Game Lab\n\nIn Game Lab, we might use the following code to check if a sprite named \"button\" was clicked and do something about it:\n\n    function draw() {\n    \tif (mousePressedOver(button)) {\n       \t\t// Do something\n       \t}\n    }\n\nIn App Lab, given a button with the ID \"button\", we could write the following code to achieve the same goal:\n\n    onEvent(\"button\", \"click\", function () {\n    \t// Do something\n    });\n\nIn the App Lab example, the function is just another argument passed to the onEvent function, it just so happens that the argument must be a function itself. We could also define the function separately and write this same program as follows:\n\n    function doSomething() {\n    \t// Do something\n    }\n\n    onEvent(\"button\", \"click\", doSomething);\n\nIn the second example, notice that when we pass the function `doSomething` to the `onEvent` function we _don't_ include the parenthesis at the end. This is because we're actually passing the whole function as an object."

    "long_instructions": "# Button Events\n\nWith our screens in place, it's time to start actually _programming_ the app so that it responds to button clicks. For each button on each screen, you'll want to add an `onEvent` block that watches for that button to be clicked and responds appropriately. To start off with we'll just watch the \"home\\_search\\_btn\" button and print something to the console when it's clicked\n\n# Do This\n\nYou're now in Code Mode (you can use the buttons above your app to switch between Code Mode and Design Mode). This is where you can write the code that will respond to users interacting with your app.\n\n[][0]\n\n-   **Drag out an `onEvent` block** from the code toolbox.\n-   **Select \"home\\_search\\_btn\"** from the \"id\" dropdown.\n-   **Drag out a `console.log` block** from the variables drawer.\n-   **Run your app**.\n-   **Click the Search button** and look for messages in the console."

Any issues that students encounter when importing their teammates' screens can only be resolved through teamwork, and will likely be a problem for all members of the team."

Make sure that you test your work often, using `console.log()` blocks to debug any strange behavior with your app. When you think you've got the whole thing working, compare your app with other members of your group to see if they work the same."

    "teacher_markdown": "#### Implementing Features and Fixes Individually\n\nBecause App Lab is difficult for large groups of students to work on simultaneously, we have students work on implementing features and fixes individually or in pairs. The benefit of this approach is that it allows the team as a whole to explore more potential features than if they were working all on the same app, but it also means that each team member's app will diverge further from the others as more changes are made.\n\nAs an optional extension activity you could provide a day of work for students to share their changes with each other and attempt to integrate all of the added features into a single app.\n\n#### Keeping Track of Changes\n\nThe more features students add to their app, the more likely they are to introduce new unforeseen bugs. To ensure that students always keep the most recent working copy of their app, encourage them make a remix before adding any new features. Make sure students leave the remix alone and return to this level to do their programming - this will ensure that when they go to submit their app for your review it is the most recent version."
