You might call it the **counter pattern** since it can be used to make a variable that counts up. You'll use this pattern a lot, especially with the draw loop. Let's see what that looks like.\n\n# Do This\n\nThis program creates a variable `counter` and then uses the **counter pattern** to make it count up. When you run the program what do you think you'll see on the screen?\n\n-   **Read the program** and make a prediction of what the output will be.\n-   **Run the program** to check your prediction.\n-   **Discuss with a neighbor**. Can you explain what you observed?"

You can look at the `loopItem` function for clues in how to reset the item position.\n-   Inside your `if` statement, add a counter pattern that will increase the score every time the player touches an item.  Look at [Lesson 16 Puzzle 9][0] for an example.\n-   Call the function inside the draw loop, in the \"update sprites\" area of your code.\n-   Run the code to test your function."
