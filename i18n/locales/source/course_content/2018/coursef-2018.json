After creating your game, you will get the chance to present it to others and receive feedback.  These steps are all critically important in the software industry, and getting practice with the elements of the design process will help you create better products more efficiently.  \n\nHere is what the coming weeks will hold as we learn more about the design process:\n\n1. **Define & Prepare**\n   * Play existing games to get ideas and understand limitations\n   * Brainstorm and plan your new or modified app\n1. **Try**\n   * Follow your plan to build an app\n1. **Reflect & Edit**\n   * Swap apps with another group to help make your projects better\n1. **Present**\n   * Show off your final product!\n"
