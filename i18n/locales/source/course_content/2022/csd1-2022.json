We care about your experience in the course, and we make improvements based on what you say.\n\n***\n### School in general### \n",

Most teachers do this as part of a day of initial class tech setup.\n\nYou will be able to see the anonymized results of the survey for your students.\n\nWhy is this survey here?\n* A major goal of this course is to broaden participation in computer science.\n* We attempt to measure how students' attitudes and beliefs about computer science might change during the course through pre and post-surveys.\n* Completing it also helps us understand important improvements we can make to the curriculum to improve the teacher and student experience.\n\n\n* Please help by having your students contribute to this vital dataset. Their voices make the difference!\n"

Students should take time working in their groups to think of specific things that they did that follow each step of the process.   The goal of this discussion is to make the abstract steps more concrete and accessible to students by relating them to a shared activity.\n\nThe second question gives students a chance to expand their understanding of the process to a different problem, seeing how the different steps may look in different domains.  The goal of this discussion is to make sure students have a general enough understanding of the process that they can apply it to a wider variety of problems, since the process will be used throughout the course in various domains."

Within a problem solving context, computers are designed to solve information problems.  Subtleties may come up in the discussion around computers that have output mechanisms that allow them to do physical work (e.g. robots).  It's okay if students do not come to a particular conclusion about every device they can think of."

While they should be familiar with how the model works with apps, there may still be questions around other computing devices, and around the examples shown later in the lesson.  For example, one common source of controversy around processing is whether some devices are processing information themselves, or whether the user is processing the information, while the device simply stores information (e.g. the abacus)."
