      "markdown": "# Mocking Up Your App\n\nNow that you have some practice laying out elements in App Lab, you can start working on mocking your own app. With your group, divvy up the screens so that everyone is working on a different screen.\n\nBecause you'll be dividing the work up, you'll want to do some planning ahead of time to decide on a common look and feel for your pages. For example, you'll want to agree on things such as:\n\n* Where do navigation buttons go?\n* What colors will you use for backgrounds, text, and buttons\n* What's the general style and layout?\n\n# Namespacing\n\nIn the next lesson you will combine all of your team members' screens into one app. To make sure that the IDs on one page don't conflict with another you'll need to include a unique _namespace_ for your page. This will be something you add to the beginning of every id so that your element ids don't conflict with others when you merge everyone's screens together. Your namespace should be the ID of your screen with an underscore at the end. For example, if you are making the home page, you might use \"home_\" as your namespace - leading to ids such as:\n\n* \"home_title\"\n* \"home_loginButton\"\n* \"home_logo\"\n",
      "teacher_markdown": "#### Namespacing\n\nEnsuring that all students are both creating unique IDs for all elements and properly namespacing them will go a long way towards avoiding issues in the next lesson, so it pays to be a stickler here. You can provide students with the optional Screen Design Activity Guide to keep track of their element IDs.\n\n#### Working together, apart\n\nEven more so than the the paper prototyping activity, it is easy for students in this lesson to forget that they need to consider how their choices affect their team. Encourage active discussion among teams as they design screens to ensure that they are all working towards a common goal.\n"

    "teacher_markdown": "#### Implementing Features and Fixes Individually\n\nBecause App Lab is difficult for large groups of students to work on simultaneously, we have students work on implementing features and fixes individually or in pairs. The benefit of this approach is that it allows the team as a whole to explore more potential features than if they were working all on the same app, but it also means that each team member's app will diverge further from the others as more changes are made.\n\nAs an optional extension activity you could provide a day of work for students to share their changes with each other and attempt to integrate all of the added features into a single app.\n\n#### Keeping Track of Changes\n\nThe more features students add to their app, the more likely they are to introduce new unforeseen bugs. To ensure that students always keep the most recent working copy of their app, encourage them make a remix before adding any new features. Make sure students leave the remix alone and return to this level to do their programming - this will ensure that when they go to submit their app for your review it is the most recent version."
