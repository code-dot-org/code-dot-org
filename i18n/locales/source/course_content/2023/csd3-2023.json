This can be an opportunity to gain insights and offer feedback on the skills students demonstrate while building their scene, even if they do not finish the level completely. This type of level can also reinforce the Problem Solving Process as students ideate and develop a web page of their own choosing (Define - Prepare - Try - Reflect).\r\n\r\nAs students develop more skills throughout the unit, they may decide to use an idea from this level as the basis for one of their projects or to continue developing on their own time.\r\n"

These move just like the platforms, but faster.  In order to make the game more interesting, the items start at a random location above the screen.  For the sample game, the item's x position is a random number between 50 and 350, and the y position is a random number between -30 and -60.\n\n# Do This\n\n-   Use the `createSprite` block to make an item sprite in the \"create sprites\" section of your code.\n-   Use the `randomNumber` block inside your `createSprite` block to start the item at a random x and y position.\n-   Use `setAnimation` and `velocityY` to give your sprite the correct image and make it fall from the top of the screen.\n-   Run the code to test your sprite."

This is similar to what you did for the platform sprite, but the item sprite will loop back to a random x and y location when it goes to the top of the screen.\n\n# Do This\n\n-   Create a `loopItems` function that uses an `if` block to check whether the item sprite is off the bottom of the screen, then sends the item back to a random x and y position, just as it did when you first created the sprite.\n-   Call the function inside the draw loop.\n-   Run the code to test your sprite."

Remember that this is a lot easier in **text mode**, so be sure to try it out if you haven't already.\n\nYou'll need to copy two parts of your code: the part at the beginning where you made the item, and the part in your `loopItem` function, where you looped the item back to the top of the screen.\n\n# Do This\n\n-   Copy the code you used to create the first item sprite (`createSprite`, `setAnimation`, and `velocityY`), and paste it directly beneath the original code.\n-   Change the names of the sprite in the new lines.  For example, if you named your original sprite \"star\", you could name this one \"star2\".\n-   Inside your `loopItems` function, copy the if statement, then paste it directly underneath the original code, inside the function.\n-   Change the sprite name in the new lines of code.\n-   Run your code to test it."

Just like the item sprites, the player sprite will fall from the top of the screen.  Unlike the items, your player sprite will get faster as it falls, just like real falling objects.  This is what allows it to jump up, and fall back down.\n\n# Do This\n\n-   Use the `createSprite` block to make a player sprite with the label and starting position that you put on your worksheet.\n-   Use `setAnimation` to give it the correct image.\n-   Create a `playerFall` function that makes the sprite fall from the top of the screen.  The code inside the function should use `velocityY` in a counter pattern, just as when you made the falling rock in [Lesson 21 Level 3][0].\n-   Call the `playerFall` function inside the draw loop.\n-   Run the code to test your sprite."

Your player needs to move to the left when the left arrow key is pressed, to the right when the right arrow key is pressed, and jump when the up arrow is pressed.\n\n# Do This\n\n-   Create a new `controlPlayer` function in the \"functions\" area of your code.\n-   Inside the `controlPlayer` function, use the `if`, `keyDown`, and `sprite.x` blocks to make your player move to the left and right according to the arrow keys. Look at [Lesson 16 Level 6][0] for examples.\n-   Inside the `controlPlayer` function, use the `if`, `keyDown`, and `velocityY` blocks to make your player jump when the up arrow is pressed.

You can look at the `loopItem` function for clues in how to reset the item position.\n-   Inside your `if` statement, add a counter pattern that will increase the score every time the player touches an item.
