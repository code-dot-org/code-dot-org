If an image does not load on a web page, it is this alternate text that will show up instead.\n\n# Do This\n\n1.  Turn on the Inspector Tool.\n2.  Hover over the image on the web page to find the tag used.\n3.  Discuss with your partner:\n    -   How do you think they knew what the name of the image should be for the **src** (source) attribute? Where did they find this information here in Web Lab?\n    -   What did they put as the alternate text? Do you think that is descriptive enough?\n    -   What else do you notice about the image tag?"

Ultimately, you'll almost always use it to style whatever it contains.\n\nFlexbox gives us a more efficient way to align and distribute space among items in a `div` container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word \"flex\"). \n\n## Do This\n\n1.  Take a look at the web page below and notice the `div` container around the images.\n2.  Go look at the CSS file and notice the flex properites applied to the `div`.\n3.

Let's try out the **first two steps**:  **1) establish flex layout** and **2) define the direction and wrap**.\n\n# Do This\n\n1.  Add a `div` container around the image tags.\n2.  Add the class name `.container` to the `div` tag.\n3.  Add the following Flex properties to the container:\n    -   Establish flex layout with `display: flex;`\n    -   Define the flow direction with `flex-direction: row;`. \n    -   Define if items should wrap with `flex-wrap: wrap;`.\n4.  Change the size of your Preview window to see the wrapping effects (see gif below).\n5.  Change the values for the `flex-direction` property to see what each one does: \n    -   Value options include:\n        -   `row`\n        -   `row-reverse`\n        -   `column`\n        -   `column-reverse`\n6.

Think of it as the same thing as defining an element's `width`.\r\n\r\nThe default value for this property is `auto` which sets the **ideal size of the element based on its content**. We can also set a specific size for our elements by defining the value of `flex-basis`. \r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\n**In the CSS file:**\r\n1. Add the `flex-basis` property to the first container and set value to `auto`\r\n   - _This will set the \"ideal size\" of the element based on its content._\r\n2. Add the `flex-basis` property to the second container and set value to `150px`\r\n   - _This will explicitly set the size of the element to `150px`\r\n\r\n**In the HTML file:**\r\n1. Add some more text to **one** of the paragraphs in the **\"basis-auto\"** container. \r\n   * Notice how the element will expand as much as it can while still keeping the other two elements at their ideal size based on their content.\r\n   * _This is the default for all Flex items._\r\n2. Add some more text to **one** of the paragraphs in the **\"basis-fixed\"** container.\r\n   * Notice how the element's width does not change since you set it to be 150px.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Don't forget to add this property to your <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lrkMGcPwjKo4g5uyvVfaXpFb7kRUfdtqcsqLRtaDWYM/edit?usp=sharing\">Flexbox Children Cheat Sheet</a>!**\r\n\r\n"

        "long_instructions": "# Flex Property\r\n\r\nThe \"flex\" property is the shorthand for `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink` and `flex-basis` combined into one line. When we use it in CSS, it looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndiv {\r\n  flex: 1 0 auto;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis example sets the `flex-grow` to 1, the `flex-shrink` to 0, and the `flex-basis` to auto. An easy way to think of this and remember the order is to imagine you are setting the **\"max\"**, **\"min\"**, and **\"ideal size\"**. \r\n\r\n_Check out the previous challenge level or the \"Help & Tips\" tab to learn about `flex-basis`!_\r\n\r\nLet's check out what some commonly used value combinations for the `flex` property will do!\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\n**In the CSS file:**\r\n\r\n::: details [1. Set the child elements of \"flex1\" to not grow when there is free space, to shrink when there is not enough space, and their size to be based on their content _(expand me to get more instructions)_]\r\n- **Add the `flex` property to the \"flex1\" child elements with the following three values:**\r\n   - **Set the first \"grow\" value to 0.** This will make the items _inflexible_ when there is some free space left in the container. \r\n   - **Set the second \"shrink\" value to 1.** This will allow the elements to shrink to their minimum size when there is not enough space in the container. \r\n   - **Set the third \"ideal size\" value to \"auto\".** This will size the items based on their content.\r\n:::\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n::: details [2. Set the child elements of \"flex2\" to grow to absorb any extra space, to shrink when there is not enough space, and their size to be based on their content _(expand me to get more instructions)_]\r\n- **Add the `flex` property to the \"flex2\" child elements with the following three values:**\r\n   - **Set the first \"grow\" value to 1.** This will make the items absorb any extra space left in the container. \r\n   - **Set the second \"shrink\" value to 1.** This will allow the elements to shrink to their minimum size when there is not enough space in the container. \r\n   - **Set the third \"ideal size\" value to \"auto\".** This will size the items based on their content.\r\n:::\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n::: details [3. Set the child elements of \"flex3\" to not grow when there is free space, to not shrink when there is not enough space, and their size to be based on their content _(expand me to get more instructions)_]\r\n- **Add the `flex` property to the \"flex3\" child elements with the following three values:**\r\n   - **Set the first \"grow\" value to 0.** This will make the items _inflexible_ when there is some free space left in the container. \r\n   - **Set the second \"shrink\" value to 0.** This will not allow the elements to shrink even in an overflow situation. \r\n   - **Set the third \"ideal size\" value to \"auto\".** This will size the items based on their content.\r\n:::\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n4. Resize the Preview Window to see the differences between the three layouts. \r\n   - Make sure you fully expand the Preview Window as well as shrink the window to be very, very small.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Make sure to add this to your <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lrkMGcPwjKo4g5uyvVfaXpFb7kRUfdtqcsqLRtaDWYM/edit?usp=sharing\">Flexbox Children Cheat Sheet</a>!**\r\n\r\n"

In short, if there are competing rule sets, styles declared later typically override those declared earlier.\n\n**One way to remember the right order is with the phrase \"LOVE, HATE\" - LV, HA (Link, Visited, Hover, Active).**\n\n# Do This\n\n**In the CSS file:**\n\n1.  Add a rule for each of the states for the `<a>` element in the right order.\n    -   `a:link`\n    -   `a:visited`\n    -   `a:hover`\n    -   `a:active`\n2.  Style each state with a different color and font size.\n3.  Add any other different styles to each state of your choice.\n\n**In the Preview Window:**\n\n1.  Click the \"Refresh and Save\" button to make sure your styles have been applied.\n2.  Test each state to make sure they work\n    -   Hover over the link to see your \"hover\" styling. \n    -   _Slowly_ click on the link to see your \"active\" styling.\n    -   Click on the link and come back to Web Lab to see if the link changed to your \"visited\" style. \n\n<br>\n\n::: details [🔎 **Show Me How To Get Started** 🔍]\n\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/2f5beba5755add94ceae9df3522428f8-image-1708196980711.gif\" style=\"width:500px\">\n\n**More resources are in the \"Help and Tips\" tab**\n:::\n\n[][0]"

With our \"hover\" pseudo-class, we can make these cards even more visually appealing and responsive to our users by using two new properties: `transform` and `transition`. \r\n\r\nThe `transform` property applies 2D or 3D transformation to an element. This property allows you to rotate, scale, and move elements! There are _many_ value options!\r\n\r\nThe `transition` property specifies the duration and time for `transform` property. The syntax of this property looks like this: `transition: property duration timing;`\r\n\r\n_We'll also see how to change our mouse cursor when we hover over an image card using CSS to draw attention to them._\r\n\r\nLet's try this out!\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\n**In the CSS file:**\r\n1) Add a rule for the \"hover\" pseudo-class for the \"ramen-card\" class.\r\n2) Add the `transform` property with the value of `translateY(-15px)`\r\n   - _This will set the card to move up by 15 pixels._\r\n2) Add the `transition` property to the \"ramen-card\" rule set with a value of `transform 0.3 ease-in-out;`\r\n   - _This will set the type of transition to \"transform\" (which we just set in step 2), with a 0.3 duration for the transition, and to ease in and out of the transition._\r\n4) Add the `cursor` property with a value of `pointer` to the \"ramen-card\" rule set.\r\n\r\n**BONUS:** Play around with different `transform` values! Here's a list of some to try:\r\n- `translateX(px);` - moves the card left or right depending on if the number px is positive or negative\r\n- `translate(x, y);` - moves the card left/right and up/down depending on if the number for eachc px is positive or negative\r\n- `scale(x, y);` - resizes the card in both directions. For example, `scale(1.5, 1.5);` will have your card get bigger by 1.5 on both axis.\r\n- `scaleX(x);` - resizes the card horizontally\r\n- `scaleY(y);` - resizes the card vertically\r\n- `rotate(deg);` - rotates the card by the number degrees indicated. Note: the value in the parenthesis should be written as follows: `rotate(20deg);`\r\n\r\n**HAVE FUN WITH THESE RESPONSIVE TECHNIQUES!**"
