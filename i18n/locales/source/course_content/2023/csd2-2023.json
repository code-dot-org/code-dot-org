The H1 element is the highest or most important level, and the H6 element is the least important.\n\nThese different heading levels help to communicate the organization and hierarchy of the content on a page. For example, headings with an equal or higher ranking indicate the start of a new section, and headings with a lower rank indicate the start of a new subsection that is part of a higher-ranked section.\n\n# Do This\n\n1.  Turn on the Inspector Tool.\n2.  Hover over each of the bold headings on the web page to find out which heading size was used.\n3.
