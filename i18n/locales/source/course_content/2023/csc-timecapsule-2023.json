Then, it is put in a safe place, like buried in the ground or in a strong box in a library, for many years. \n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>When the time is right, someone will open the box</strong> and see all the special things put inside, and they'll know all about what life was like when it was buried. \n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>A digital time capsule poem </strong>is similar, but instead of keeping things inside of a box, it holds pictures, videos, and messages that are stored on a computer or on the internet.\n</div>\n\n"
