The term ‚Äúvoice‚Äù here does not refer to the sound of a spoken voice, but text that reads like an author's voice. Starting with a random word, the app gives you 5 options for  the next word based on the structure and probabilities of whatever short story, poem, song, or writing piece it's currently modeling. Use the example ‚Äúvoices‚Äù (written works), or add your own \"voice\" which could be from a well known work or some of your own writing!\n\n## Do This\n\nPress the orange Run button on the bottom of the app, then follow the prompts on your activity guide to explore this widget.
