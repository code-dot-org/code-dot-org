There's no way to search for or bookmark videos - the only content you see is based on the people you like and subscribe to. Based on the subscription, you‚Äôll see videos from these content creators and other videos they like and recommend.\n\n**Do This:** \n\n-   Press the orange Run button underneath the app window to start the app. Choose a content creator to follow. Each content creator has a small biography to help you decide who to follow. \n-   Once you've chosen a person, check out the videos that are automatically recommended to you.\n-   If you'd like, try a few other content creators to see which videos they recommend.\n\n<details style=\"background-color: #ececec; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; border: 1px solid transparent; border-radius: 5px;\">\n    <summary style=\"font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;\">üîé Click here to read more about Alex</summary>\n    <div style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;\">\n    <table>\n    <td style=\"padding-right: 10px\"><img src=\"https://images.code.org/a6aaf4a480329835a5b29359f9c8eafb-alex-notext.png\" /></td>\n    <td>\n<p>\nAlex loves spending time outdoors, exploring nature, and going on thrilling adventures.

Instead, it had ready-made responses for things people might say to it.

You can see an example of this in the [Documentation for Midjourney][0] (an AI model that uses stable diffusion), where images start with a mostly blank canvas and gradually become more detailed and \"in focus\".\n\nThe actual method used to generate the noise has been simplified for this widget - it is not truly Gaussian noise (which is used in actual diffusion models), and is not truly done in \"generations\".",
