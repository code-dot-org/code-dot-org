    "long_instructions": "# Fruit & Veggie Explorer\n\nThis widget has the same fruits and veggies from the previous lesson, but you now have more **features** to play with and more flexibility with how you draw your deciding line.\n\n## How The Widget Works\n\n-   Hover over a dot to see the food it represents. Orange dots are fruits, purple dots are veggies.\n-   Use the dropdowns to change the features used to create the graph. This will reload your data using your new features.\n-   Click in two places to draw a line to separate the data.\n-   Your accuracy is shown at the bottom. This is how many fruits and veggies landed in the correctly shaded part of the graph.\n    -   If you have really low accuracy, try pressing the Flip Colors button to switch the orange vs purple shading\n-   Press the \"Try Your Own Food!\" button to test your own data and see how your model classifies it.\n\n::: details [**Click Here for Feature Explanations**]\n\n-   **Size**: How big the food is. The higher the value, the bigger the food is.\n-   **Hardness**: How hard the food is. The higher the value, the harder the food is (usually because of a rind or shell)\n-   **Easy to Eat**: How easy the food is to eat. The higher the value, the easier it is to just pick up the food and eat it\n-   **Juiciness**: How juicy the food is. The higher the value, the juicier the food is.\n-   **Sweetness**: How sweet the food is. The higher the value, the sweeter the food is.\n-   **Can Smell It**: How fragrant the food is. The higher the value, the more the food smells (like onions)\n-   **Green-ness**: How green the food is on the outside. The higher the value, the greener the food is (like watermelon or limes)\n-   **Stackability**: How easy it is to stack the food into a pile. The higher the value, the easier it is to stack the food on one another without them rolling away or squishing.\n    :::\n\n## Do This\n\nUsing the dropdowns to adjust the features, draw a line that creates a model that correctly classifies at least 80% of the fruits and 80% of the veggies\n\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/7c501f5e08f2cb06b5ddc5c1aae26f31-image-1625704907103.png\" width=\"200px\">",
