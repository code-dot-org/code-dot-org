They will give you an idea of what the UI (User Interface) could look like for apps with different goals.\n\nFor each example app:\n\n* Click through the example to get a feel for how it functions.\n* In your activity guide, make a note of any features or UI elements you find and what they are used for.\n* Discuss with your groups how that app and any of its UI features could be applied to your chosen topic.\n\n# A Note About Functionality\n\nThese apps are _prototypes_; they allow a user to interact with the design without worrying about the underlying functionality. For example, when you take use the Quiz App, each question will always respond the same way, regardless of which answer you choose.\n\nBy focusing on an interactive prototype first you can learn a lot about how users might use your app before investing too much energy in making it actually work.\n",
      "teacher_markdown": "In this activity students will be introduced to a small number of relatively constrained apps:\n\n* Quiz Me\n* Decision Maker\n* List Manager\n* Crowdsourcing\n\nFor younger or more inexperienced students you may want to restrict them to _just_ these app types. We've specifically chosen these examples because they are relatively easy to prototype in App Lab.\n\nIf you allow students to stray from these, be aware that some types of apps are more difficult to create in App Lab and may require more creativity in developing a prototype. For example, App Lab has no mapping functionality, so if students wanted to create a mapping app, they would need to find or create a static image of a map to use in their app.\n"

Each button links to a page that either confirms that you were correct, or gives you information about why you were were wrong.\n\nMore advanced quiz apps could include features such as:\n\n-   Different types of questions (such as matching, free response, or even interactive games)\n-   Randomizing the order of questions\n-   Changing the questions based on how we'll you're doing\n-   Providing a final score\n-   Incorporating study material\n\n# Functionality Missing from this Prototype\n\n-   Questions aren't actually checked for correctness"

    "long_instructions": "# Decision Maker\n\nSimilar to the quiz app, a decision tree app asks the user a series of questions. The primary difference between the two is that a decision tree doesn't check for right or wrong answers, but instead attempts to give the user a suggestion or help them make a decision based on their answers.\n\nThis simple decision maker asks only three questions,  but more advanced ones actually take the form of a tree as seen below:\n\n[][0]\n\nDepending on the user's answer to each question, they're given a different page for the next question. This allows the app to gradually narrow down the decision one question at a time. This type of app can be really useful to help users understand complex processes - for example, you might introduce a recycling program by using a decision tree app to help users figure out which bin to sort items into - first asking what material it's made out of, then whether it is clean or not, and so on.\n\n# Functionality Missing from this Prototype\n\n-   Question buttons don't direct you to different screens\n-   The final screen doesn't give you a recommended decision"

This app also only keeps track of the name of an item and whether or not it is \"Done,\" but it could be extended to track and organize any amount of information about the list items.\n\n# Functionality Missing from this Prototype\n\n-   Delete buttons don't actually delete items from the list\n-   Add screen doesn't actually add an item to the list"

This app is very similar to the list app, with the main difference being that the list app assumes a single user while this app allows all users to add to the same list and \"like\" submissions.\n\nThis example uses a list of crowdsourced information for simplicity, but you could display any kind of information in many different formats. A crowdsourcing app could allow users to submit locations for display on a map, images to go into a gallery, or any number of other types of information.\n\n# Functionality Missing from this Prototype\n\n-   User's can't create accounts or profiles\n-   Submitted things aren't added to the list\n-   Clicking on the \"like\" icons don't change their state"

For example, you'll want to agree on things such as:\n\n* Where do navigation buttons go?\n* What colors will you use for backgrounds, text, and buttons\n* What's the general style and layout?\n\n# Namespacing\n\nIn the next lesson you will combine all of your team members' screens into one app. To make sure that the IDs on one page don't conflict with another you'll need to include a unique _namespace_ for your page. This will be something you add to the beginning of every id so that your element ids don't conflict with others when you merge everyone's screens together. Your namespace should be the ID of your screen with an underscore at the end. For example, if you are making the home page, you might use \"home_\" as your namespace - leading to ids such as:\n\n* \"home_title\"\n* \"home_loginButton\"\n* \"home_logo\"\n",
      "teacher_markdown": "#### Namespacing\n\nEnsuring that all students are both creating unique IDs for all elements and properly namespacing them will go a long way towards avoiding issues in the next lesson, so it pays to be a stickler here. You can provide students with the optional Screen Design Activity Guide to keep track of their element IDs.\n\n#### Working together, apart\n\nEven more so than the the paper prototyping activity, it is easy for students in this lesson to forget that they need to consider how their choices affect their team. Encourage active discussion among teams as they design screens to ensure that they are all working towards a common goal.\n"

This is particularly troublesome when students leave the default screen ID \"screen1\"\n-   Conflicting element IDs: If students have _properly_ namespaced all of their elements this shouldn't be an issue, but any elements that have the default ID or share an ID with an existing element will prevent a screen from importing\n\nOnce teams move to the programming phase of this project, it becomes much more difficult for students to collaborate on the same app. The design phase is the primary opportunity for all students to collaborate on the app - after this teams will still be working together, but each student will be working on their own copy of the app."

    "teacher_markdown": "#### Just the Facts\n\nThere's a lot to consume here and many of the details about how events work in App Lab are not totally necessary to understand for our needs in this unit. If students are struggling with how programming works in App Lab, focus on these essentials:\n\n-   There is no `draw` loop that runs forever\n-   The `onEvent()` block specifies:\n    -   an element ID\n    -   an event (such as \"click\" or \"mouseover\")\n    -   code that should be run when the event occurs (this code is technically an anonymous callback function, represented by the green block)\n-   Code inside `onEvent()` blocks runs any time the specified event occurs\n\n#### Compared to Game Lab\n\nIn Game Lab, we might use the following code to check if a sprite named \"button\" was clicked and do something about it:\n\n    function draw() {\n    \tif (mousePressedOver(button)) {\n       \t\t// Do something\n       \t}\n    }\n\nIn App Lab, given a button with the ID \"button\", we could write the following code to achieve the same goal:\n\n    onEvent(\"button\", \"click\", function () {\n    \t// Do something\n    });\n\nIn the App Lab example, the function is just another argument passed to the onEvent function, it just so happens that the argument must be a function itself. We could also define the function separately and write this same program as follows:\n\n    function doSomething() {\n    \t// Do something\n    }\n\n    onEvent(\"button\", \"click\", doSomething);\n\nIn the second example, notice that when we pass the function `doSomething` to the `onEvent` function we _don't_ include the parenthesis at the end. This is because we're actually passing the whole function as an object."

To ensure that students always keep the most recent working copy of their app, encourage them make a remix before adding any new features. Make sure students leave the remix alone and return to this level to do their programming - this will ensure that when they go to submit their app for your review it is the most recent version."
