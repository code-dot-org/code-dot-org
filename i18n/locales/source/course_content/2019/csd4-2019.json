      "markdown": "# Example App Types\n\nIn the following levels you see several different example apps. They will give you an idea of what the UI (User Interface) could look like for apps with different goals.\n\nFor each example app:\n\n* Click through the example to get a feel for how it functions.\n* In your activity guide, make a note of any features or UI elements you find and what they are used for.\n* Discuss with your groups how that app and any of its UI features could be applied to your chosen topic.\n\n# A Note About Functionality\n\nThese apps are _prototypes_; they allow a user to interact with the design without worrying about the underlying functionality. For example, when you take use the Quiz App, each question will always respond the same way, regardless of which answer you choose.\n\nBy focusing on an interactive prototype first you can learn a lot about how users might use your app before investing too much energy in making it actually work.\n"

    "long_instructions": "# Quiz Me\n\nA quiz app can be used to teach, or help reinforce, information important to your chosen topic.\n\nAt its most basic, a quiz app is composed of a screen for each question with two or more buttons for multiple choice answers. Each button links to a page that either confirms that you were correct, or gives you information about why you were were wrong.\n\nMore advanced quiz apps could include features such as:\n\n-   Different types of questions (such as matching, free response, or even interactive games)\n-   Randomizing the order of questions\n-   Changing the questions based on how we'll you're doing\n-   Providing a final score\n-   Incorporating study material\n\n# Functionality Missing from this Prototype\n\n-   Questions aren't actually checked for correctness"

The primary difference between the two is that a decision tree doesn't check for right or wrong answers, but instead attempts to give the user a suggestion or help them make a decision based on their answers.\n\nThis simple decision maker asks only three questions,  but more advanced ones actually take the form of a tree as seen below:\n\n[][0]\n\nDepending on the user's answer to each question, they're given a different page for the next question. This allows the app to gradually narrow down the decision one question at a time. This type of app can be really useful to help users understand complex processes - for example, you might introduce a recycling program by using a decision tree app to help users figure out which bin to sort items into - first asking what material it's made out of, then whether it is clean or not, and so on.\n\n# Functionality Missing from this Prototype\n\n-   Question buttons don't direct you to different screens\n-   The final screen doesn't give you a recommended decision"

This app also only keeps track of the name of an item and whether or not it is \"Done,\" but it could be extended to track and organize any amount of information about the list items.\n\n# Functionality Missing from this Prototype\n\n-   Delete buttons don't actually delete items from the list\n-   Add screen doesn't actually add an item to the list"

This app is very similar to the list app, with the main difference being that the list app assumes a single user while this app allows all users to add to the same list and \"like\" submissions.\n\nThis example uses a list of crowdsourced information for simplicity, but you could display any kind of information in many different formats. A crowdsourcing app could allow users to submit locations for display on a map, images to go into a gallery, or any number of other types of information.\n\n# Functionality Missing from this Prototype\n\n-   User's can't create accounts or profiles\n-   Submitted things aren't added to the list\n-   Clicking on the \"like\" icons don't change their state"

For example, you'll want to agree on things such as:\n\n* Where do navigation buttons go?\n* What colors will you use for backgrounds, text, and buttons\n* What's the general style and layout?\n\n# Namespacing\n\nIn the next lesson you will combine all of your team members' screens into one app. To make sure that the IDs on one page don't conflict with another you'll need to include a unique _namespace_ for your page. This will be something you add to the beginning of every id so that your element ids don't conflict with others when you merge everyone's screens together. Your namespace should be the ID of your screen with an underscore at the end. For example, if you are making the home page, you might use \"home_\" as your namespace - leading to ids such as:\n\n* \"home_title\"\n* \"home_loginButton\"\n* \"home_logo\"\n"
