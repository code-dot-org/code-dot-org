Each button links to a page that either confirms that you were correct, or gives you information about why you were were wrong.\n\nMore advanced quiz apps could include features such as:\n\n-   Different types of questions (such as matching, free response, or even interactive games)\n-   Randomizing the order of questions\n-   Changing the questions based on how we'll you're doing\n-   Providing a final score\n-   Incorporating study material\n\n# Functionality Missing from this Prototype\n\n-   Questions aren't actually checked for correctness",
    "https://studio.code.org/s/csd4-2019/stage/10/puzzle/4": "# Decision Maker\n\nSimilar to the quiz app, a decision tree app asks the user a series of questions. The primary difference between the two is that a decision tree doesn't check for right or wrong answers, but instead attempts to give the user a suggestion or help them make a decision based on their answers.\n\nThis simple decision maker asks only three questions,  but more advanced ones actually take the form of a tree as seen below:\n\n[][0]\n\nDepending on the user's answer to each question, they're given a different page for the next question. This allows the app to gradually narrow down the decision one question at a time. This type of app can be really useful to help users understand complex processes - for example, you might introduce a recycling program by using a decision tree app to help users figure out which bin to sort items into - first asking what material it's made out of, then whether it is clean or not, and so on.\n\n# Functionality Missing from this Prototype\n\n-   Question buttons don't direct you to different screens\n-   The final screen doesn't give you a recommended decision",

This app also only keeps track of the name of an item and whether or not it is \"Done,\" but it could be extended to track and organize any amount of information about the list items.\n\n# Functionality Missing from this Prototype\n\n-   Delete buttons don't actually delete items from the list\n-   Add screen doesn't actually add an item to the list",
    "https://studio.code.org/s/csd4-2019/stage/10/puzzle/6": "# Crowdsourcing\n\nCrowdsourcing apps allow multiple users to submit content for everyone to use (the _source_ of content is the _crowd_). This app is very similar to the list app, with the main difference being that the list app assumes a single user while this app allows all users to add to the same list and \"like\" submissions.\n\nThis example uses a list of crowdsourced information for simplicity, but you could display any kind of information in many different formats. A crowdsourcing app could allow users to submit locations for display on a map, images to go into a gallery, or any number of other types of information.\n\n# Functionality Missing from this Prototype\n\n-   User's can't create accounts or profiles\n-   Submitted things aren't added to the list\n-   Clicking on the \"like\" icons don't change their state",
