For now, they do not need to worry about every button, as they will be explained later, but they should understand that the inspector tool helps them to link parts of the web page with code that created them, and the refresh and save button allows them to update their webpage if it does not automatically update when they change the code.\n\nAlthough it's not part of the video, the instructions pane will also often include drop down questions and answers that students can use when they are completing an activity, and in some levels the tabs at the top of the instructions pane will take students to a \"Help and Tips\" area that includes reference information relevant to the activities."

    "teacher_markdown": "## Discussion Goals\n\nAs student discuss HTML tags, make sure they understand that HTML tags are used to structure, or organize, content on the screen.  Talking about the organization, structure, or role of the content in the page (heading, paragraph, list, etc.) is more accurate than talking about specific aspects of its appearance (such as size or spacing).  \n\nAlthough certain structural roles may be associated with appearance (headings are larger), HTML does not specify anything in particular about the appearance.  This allows users with different needs, such as the visually impaired, to interact with the structured content in a way that makes the most sense for them.  Later in the unit, students will learn about styles and CSS, which allows them to specify exact size, color, and spacing to their HTML elements.\n\nThe paragraph tag separates text into paragraphs.  You may want to follow up this question by asking students how they think a web browser for the blind might deal with paragraphs.  For example, while sighted people may use spacing and new lines to separate out paragraphs, what should a screen reader do?"

Since people often make little mistakes when writing their web pages, browsers are programmed to make a best guess of what you intended to do. Sometimes different browsers are even programmed to make different guesses! The only way to ensure your code looks like you intend is make sure you're always using tags correctly.\n\n:::\n\n::: details [**Why does the code sometimes turn pink?**]\n\nWeb Lab is programmed to automatically detect some mistakes in HTML.  When it notices a mistake, it turns that code pink.  The mistake might be in pink, or it might be somewhere before the pink code.  You'll need to carefully debug to find your mistake.\n\n:::\n\n</div>\n\n# Debug: Fix the Broken Tags\n\nThis simple web page has some issues which are preventing the content from being displayed correctly.

The footprint questions are designed to push students towards combining details from multiple social platforms and understanding that together the profiles represent more detailed information than the users probably intend to reveal about themselves. Some questions may not be answerable for all users, or may have different levels of details (full street address for one user, but only a city and state for another).\n\n**Share:** Have the class share the digital footprints that they developed through the activity.\n\n**Discuss:**\n\n* Which information was most difficult to find?\n* Which details were innocuous on their own, but revealed private information when combined with other details?\n* How does this make you think differently about what you choose to post online?\n"

You'll be linking the two pages by creating a **navigation bar** at the top of the page.  Websites usually have the same navigation bar across all of their pages so you can get back and forth between things on the site.  You can see an example of a navigation bar on <a href=\"https://studio.code.org/projects/weblab/2KO4FIjN89QPeYnTG_NzLIjroaG8daOY3jRl5uHm1Co/\" target=\"_new\">this page</a>\n\n# Do This\n\n-   In your home page (index.html), add two hyperlinks at the top of the page, one to your lists page, and one to the home page.\n    -   _Even though it might seem strange to link a page to itself, it's less confusing if the navigation bar is exactly the same on every page._\n-   Copy the code for the navigation bar, then add it to the top of your lists page.\n-   Test your links in the preview area by clicking on them."

    "teacher_markdown": "## Discussion Goals\n\nStudents should understand that the structure of the page is there to organize the information in a logical way, but doesn't tell the computer how to display it.  So, for example, the structure could include different headings and paragraphs, but would say nothing about the color of text or how big it is displayed.  The style of the page is the specifics of its appearance.  Without a particular style, each web browser would decide how to display different web page elements on their own.\n\nStyles are important to allow web developers to decide exactly how a web page looks on the screen.  Because styles are separate from structure and content, web developers can change the style of an entire page very easily, without having to make any changes to the structure and content of the web page.  This means that it's very easy for web pages to have an individual look and feel that is unified across the entire page."

While they have previously been using HTML tags to label and categorize their content, they're now learning how to control the style of the different elements in their page using CSS. Students may have some misconceptions at this point since their browser has used default styles for their different kinds of content (e.g. `<h1>` tags by default make text larger). As they move through these lessons they should come to see that tagging content really just allows the browser's default styles, or the styles they define using CSS, to be applied to the correct pieces of content in their web pages.\n\nSome students may also be confused by the fact that \"Content-Structure-Style\" and \"Cascading Style Sheets\" have the same initial letters.  CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and refers to the language they will use to style their content.  Content-structure-style is a paradigm that they use to separate out the different information that the browser needs to render a page, but should not be abbreviated \"C-S-S\", to avoid confusion."

It specifies which elements will have to follow the rules inside the curly braces. The `p` stands for paragraph.\n-   `text-align: left;` is the rule that makes the text inside the `p` tags align to the left side of the paragraph.\n    -   `text-align` is the _property_.  It explains what the rule is about, in this case the text alignment.\n    -   `left` is the _value_.  It explains how the rule should be applied, in this case making the text align to the left side of the paragraph.\n\n:::\n\n::: details [**Why doesn't <code>text-align: left;</code> do anything?**]\n\nMost properties have default values.  The default values are the styles that an element will have automatically, before you add your style sheet.  The default value for `text-align` is `left`, so it doesn't change from how it already looked.\n\n:::\n\n::: details [**What are the possible values for text align?**]\n\nYou can choose between \"left\", \"right\", and \"center\".  You can read more about the text-align property at <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_text_text-align.asp\" target=\"_new\">W3Schools - CSS text-align Property</a>\n\n:::\n\n::: details [**Why do I need all the punctuation?**]\n\nThe punctuation, such as the curly braces `{}`, the colon `:`, and the semicolon `;`, help the computer to understand the rules in the style sheet.  The curly braces hold all the rules for a particular selector.  Each rule should end in a semicolon, and the properties and values are always separated by a colon.\n\n:::\n\n::: details [**What is a style sheet?**]\n\nA style sheet is a document that controls how a web page will appear.  External style sheets are separate files that are linked to the HTML page.\n\n:::\n\n::: details [**What is CSS?**]\n\nCSS is a language that controls the way content on a web site appears.  It uses rule-sets to change the look of a page.  Each rule set has a selector, which specifies which elements on the page will be affected, and the rules, which explain how to display the elements.   Each rule consists of a property and a value for that property.\n<br/><br/>\nHere’s an example of a rule-set that makes the text in an `h2` tag blue and cursive:\n\n    h2 {\n       color: blue;\n       font-family: cursive;\n    }\n\nIn this example, `h2` is the selector, `color` and `font-family` are properties, and `blue` and `cursive` are the values for those properties.\n\n:::\n\n</div>\n\n# Text Alignment\n\nThe `text-align` property sets the horizontal (side to side) position of the text within each line.\n\n-   Find the \"text-align\" property in the paragraph tag.\n-   Change the paragraph alignment.\n    -   Choose from \"left\", \"right\", and \"center\""

    "teacher_markdown": "# Differences in Browsers and Operating Systems\n\nAs mentioned in this map, you may find that different combinations of computers and browsers render fonts differently. While there is a common specification for how HTML and CSS should be read and displayed on the screen, each browser does so in a slightly different way, which can lead to the same page looking different on different computers. If your students encounter this, you can reassure them that it's a common challenge that web developers face.\n\nIn the case of `font-family: fantasy`, you can actually specify a list of fonts, from most to least specific. That way, if a user's computer has the exact font you specified, that's what they'll see, but if not the browser will try the next font on your list. To try and ensure that users see the font in the example image, you could write the css as `font-family: Papyrus, fantasy`. That way, even if a user's browser has a different default font for \"fantasy\", it will try to load the specific font \"Papyrus\" first.\n\nIf students want the page to show an exact font, they'll need to use a font from the web, so the browser can download that specific font to use when rendering the page.  More information on these fonts can be found at [Google Fonts][0] and [W3Schools][1]."

Defining the height will also change the width so that the image does not stretch, unless you have also defined the width.  You can read more about this property at <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_dim_height.asp\" target=\"_new\">W3Schools - CSS height Property</a>\n\n:::\n\n::: details [**What does `px` mean / What is a pixel?**]\n\nPixel, which is abbreviated `px`, is how elements are measured in CSS.  It’s the size of a single point of light on the screen.\n\n:::\n\n::: details [**Why does using a width and height rule at the same time sometimes stretch out the image?**]\n\nWhen the width of an images changes, the height must change by the same percentage, otherwise the image will stretch.  For example, if you double the width of an image, you must also double the height, or the image will be stretched horizonally.  When you only define the width or the height, the computer will automatically change the other property so that the image looks the same.\n\n:::\n\n</div>\n\n# Width and Height\n\n-   Find the property in the style sheet that controls the width of the images.\n-   Change the width of the images to be larger or smaller.\n-   Create a new rule with a `height` property to control the height of the images.\n-   Use the `width` property in the `p` rule-set to change the width of your paragraphs."
