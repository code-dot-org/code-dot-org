Since people often make little mistakes when writing their web pages, browsers are programmed to make a best guess of what you intended to do. Sometimes different browsers are even programmed to make different guesses! The only way to ensure your code looks like you intend is make sure you're always using tags correctly.\n\n:::\n\n::: details [**Why does the code sometimes turn pink?**]\n\nWeb Lab is programmed to automatically detect some mistakes in HTML.

Headings add structure to your web page by breaking it up so it's easier for a user to read.\n:::\n\n::: details [**How do I make different sized headings?**]\nHeadings come in 6 different sizes. So far you have primarily used the biggest one: `<h1>`. The number '1' in the HTML tag designates that this is the biggest heading. The smallest heading is `<h6>`. You can also try the `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, and `<h5>` tags, which get smaller as the number gets larger.\n:::\n\n::: details [**What is HTML?**]\nHTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.

Another way HTML allows you to organize your code is by using **headings**.  A heading is a short piece of text that goes at the top of a section of content, like a title.\n\n# Do This:\n\n-   Find the headings in the web page below and use the Inspector Tool to see the code that makes them.\n-   Make sure you and your partner agree on what the tags do.\n-   Change the code so that \"Drawing\" and \"2 years\" match the headings on the rest of the page."

The curly braces hold all the rules for a particular selector.  Each rule should end in a semicolon, and the properties and values are always separated by a colon.\n\n:::\n\n::: details [**What is a style sheet?**]\n\nA style sheet is a document that controls how a web page will appear.

A bigger radius makes a bigger, softer curve, and a smaller radius makes a smaller, sharper curve.  A radius of zero makes a regular corner.  You can read more about this property at <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_border-radius.asp\" target=\"_new\">W3Schools - CSS3 border-radius property</a>\n\n:::\n\n::: details [**What does the float property do?**]\n\nThe `float` property makes an element \"float\", meaning that the elements that come after it all flow around it.  If the `float` value is `left`, the element will float to the left, and the elements after it will show up on its right.

It uses rule-sets to change the look of a page.  Each rule set has a selector, which specifies which elements on the page will be affected, and the rules, which explain how to display the elements.   Each rule consists of a property and a value for that property.\n\nHere’s an example of a rule-set that makes the text in an `h2` tag blue and cursive:\n\n    h2 {\n      color: blue;\n      font-family: cursive;\n    }\n\nIn this example, `h2` is the selector, `color` and `font-family` are properties, and `blue` and `cursive` are the values for those properties.\n\n:::\n\n</div>\n\n# Background Color\n\n-   Find the code in the style sheet that is making the background of the entire page light blue.\n-   Change the code to make the page a different color.\n-   Try to change the background color of just the paragraphs."

You will need the RGB values for the next activity.\n\n<div style=\"font-size: 16px\">\n<br />\n<details>\n\n<summary>\n<strong>Where can I see the whole range of color types?</strong>\n</summary>\n\nYou can find many options for colors at <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp\" target=\"_new\">W3Schools - HTML Color Picker</a>\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>\n<strong>Why do red and green make yellow?</strong>\n</summary>\n\nWhen you mix paint, red and green make brown, but RGB color mixing uses light instead of paint, so the colors mix differently.  RGB uses _additive color mixing_.  In additive color mixing, red and green make yellow, red and blue make magenta, and blue and green make cyan.  When you mix the three primary colors together (red, green, and blue), they make white.  You can read more at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_color\" target=\"_new\">Wikipedia - Additive Color</a>\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>\n<strong>How many colors can I make with RGB color mixing?</strong>\n</summary>\n\nYou can make make over sixteen million different colors with RGB color mixing.\n\n</details>\n</div>"

The `class=winter` inside the opening tag adds everything inside the tag to the class.\n:::\n\n::: details [**Why does the selector have a period in front of it?**]\nIn CSS, a period in front of a selector means that the selector is the name of a class.  If there is no period, it means that the selector is the name of an HTML tag.\n:::\n\n::: details [**Why would a web developer use classes?**]\nA web developer uses classes when some elements should be styled differently than others, even if they are the same tag.  Classes can also be used to give elements that have different tags the same style.\n:::\n\n::: details [**I got different RGB values, but mine are right, too.**]\n\nBecause RGB creates millions of different colors, some are so similar that people have a hard time telling them apart.  That means that there are multiple RGB values that are close enough to work for our winter color.\n\n:::\n\n</div>\n\n# Classes\n\nIn this page, the web developer has used classes to give some of the words our winter color.\n\n-   Look at the HTML code for the winter words.  Why is \"snowy\" the only winter word without the winter color?\n-   Add code to the HTML that will give \"snowy\" the same winter blue as the other words.\n-   Look inside the style sheet to find the rule that makes all the words in the winter class blue, and check whether your RGB numbers are close to the ones in the style sheet.  \n-   Discuss with your partner how the code works."
