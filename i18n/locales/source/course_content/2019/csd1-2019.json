No one, not even your teacher, can link your responses back to you as an individual.\n\nWe do this because we want you to **be as open and honest as possible** . We care about your experience in the course, and we make improvements based on what you say.\n\n***\n\n### Part 1: School in general\n\n#### *First, we want to ask you about your thoughts and feelings about school, in general.*\n",

Most teachers do this as part of a day of initial class tech setup.\n\nYou will be able to see the anonymized results of the survey for your students.\n\nWhy is this survey here?\n* A major goal of CS Discoveries is to broaden participation in computer science.\n* It is crucial therefore to have insight into students' attitudes and beliefs about computer science before the course so that we can measure the amount of change that occurred after the course is over.\n* Completing it also helps us understand important improvements we can make to the curriculum to improve the teacher and student experience.\n\n\n* Please help by having your students contribute to this vital dataset. Their voices make the difference!\n"

Students should take time working in their groups to think of specific things that they did that follow each step of the process.   The goal of this discussion is to make the abstract steps more concrete and accessible to students by relating them to a shared activity.\n\nThe second question gives students a chance to expand their understanding of the process to a different problem, seeing how the different steps may look in different domains.  The goal of this discussion is to make sure students have a general enough understanding of the process that they can apply it to a wider variety of problems, since the process will be used throughout the course in various domains."

    "teacher_markdown": "## Discussion Goals\n\nAfter watching the video, students should understand that computers are machines designed to help people with thinking work, as opposed to physical work.  Within a problem solving context, computers are designed to solve information problems.  Subtleties may come up in the discussion around computers that have output mechanisms that allow them to do physical work (e.g. robots).  It's okay if students do not come to a particular conclusion about every device they can think of.\n\nStudents may not have had time to sufficiently reflect on the nature of input, output, storage, and processing, so their answers here may be vague, especially around processing.  They will be able to dig into these concepts more later in the unit.  Focus on input and output for now, and allow students to disagree on particulars of storage and processing, letting them know that they will have more opportunities to explore the subject.   For example, one common source of controversy around processing is whether some devices are processing information themselves, or whether the user is processing the information, while the device simply stores information (e.g. the abacus)."
