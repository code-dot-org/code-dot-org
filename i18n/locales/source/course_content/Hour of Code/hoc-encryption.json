You can use this to either encrypt a message or decrypt it.\n\n# Do this\n\n-   Load a **Sample message** from the message dropdown. This will load a message that has been encrypted with a Caesar cipher.\n\n[][0]\n\n-   Using the buttons in the Caesar substitution tab, you can shift the alphabet forwards or backwards to try to unscramble the message.\n\n[][1]\n\nSee how long it takes you to crack the cipher! Is this a good method of encrypting secret data?\n\n<img src=\"http://code.org/api/hour/begin_encryption.png\">",
    "https://studio.code.org/s/hoc-encryption/stage/1/puzzle/4": "# Break a random substitution cipher!\n\nThis version of the tool gives you more information about the encrypted text and more options for how to try out different substitutions.\n\n### Different ways to analyze text\n\n-   Play with some of the sorting options available in the Random substitution cipher tab to get different views on the letter frequencies in the input text as well as standard English text.\n    [][0]\n\n### Different ways to substitute\n\n-   To substitute a letter you can drag a blue letter of the alphabet directly underneath the orange letter you want changed in the original ciphertext.\n    [][1]\n\n### Play.  Always play.\n\n-   There are other ways to analyze and substitute characters that you can find by clicking on the buttons and trying out whatever you like.\n-   Remember: you can't break it :)\n\nSee how long it takes you to crack the cipher!
