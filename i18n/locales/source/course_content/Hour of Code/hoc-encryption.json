You can use this to either encrypt a message or decrypt it.\n\n# Do this\n\n-   Load a **Sample message** from the message dropdown. This will load a message that has been encrypted with a Caesar cipher.\n\n[][0]\n\n-   Using the buttons in the Caesar substitution tab, you can shift the alphabet forwards or backwards to try to unscramble the message.\n\n[][1]\n\nSee how long it takes you to crack the cipher! Is this a good method of encrypting secret data?\n\n<img src=\"http://code.org/api/hour/begin_encryption.png\">"

Always play.\n\n-   There are other ways to analyze and substitute characters that you can find by clicking on the buttons and trying out whatever you like.\n-   Remember: you can't break it :)\n\nSee how long it takes you to crack the cipher!
