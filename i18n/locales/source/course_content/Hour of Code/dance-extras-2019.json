There are no puzzles here - instead there are a bunch of projects that show different ways to make more complex dance parties.\n\nYou can do these levels _in any order_. Jump around to look at how something was done in a previous level, or combine concepts between the projects. Try them all, pick your favorite, and spend your time working on adding to that project to make it your own.\n\n<a class=\"btn btn-large btn-primary next-stage submitButton pull-right\">Continue</a>\n\n<div class=\"clearfix\"></div>\n\n\n<div style=\"float: left; margin: 10px\">\n<a href=\"2\">\n<h2>\nBack and Forth\n</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/2ecaa2dc4e7c6f672ced7e043d8ae0ff-image-1573667207373.gif\"></a>\n\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"float: left; margin: 10px\">\n<a href=\"3\">\n<h2>\nMore Buttons\n</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/b25c6c68477a794c3086cf1169a5782f-image-1573666336377.gif\"></a>\n\n</div>\n<div style=\"float: left; margin: 10px\">\n<a href=\"4\">\n<h2>\nGet in Formation\n</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/70ad4cbc12321f301d43161f847bdee4-image-1541746835274.gif\"></a>\n\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"float: left; margin: 10px\">\n<a href=\"5\">\n<h2>\nWhere'd They Go?\n</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/524010de61c9af76e98bd2a5ccdba461-image-1541746855689.gif\"></a>\n\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"float: left; margin: 10px\">\n<a href=\"6\">\n<h2>\nDance Crews\n</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/f4ccfd43f9a15d68a339b449be8e96c3-image-1541746870889.gif\"></a>\n\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"float: left; margin: 10px\">\n<a href=\"7\">\n<h2>\nQuarter Notes\n</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/6b538efe77ea6e19f1428f7c0e45c621-image-1541746886875.gif\"></a>\n\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"float: left; margin: 10px\">\n<a href=\"8\">\n<h2>\nBass, Mid, Treble\n</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/3825556a395fd31bc4f767ca7ea5c566-image-1541746894197.gif\"></a>\n\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"float: left; margin: 10px\">\n<a href=\"9\">\n<h2>\nSpeed it Up, Slow it Down\n</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/d7f35c686ef0a9c5a6975889fd7c566b-image-1541746900730.gif\"></a>\n\n</div>\n"
