Try one of these ideas to extend it:\n\n-   Create a second group of dancers in a different layout\n-   Change layout when a key is pressed\n-   Change a property when the dancers change formation",
    "https://studio.code.org/s/dance-extras/stage/1/puzzle/3": "# Where'd They Go?\n\nThis dance shows and hides two different groups of dancers. Check it out, and then try adding your own flair.\n\n-   Add another group of dancers\n-   Show and hide dancers using the arrow keys\n-   Hide all of the dancers and switch to an exciting background effect",
    "https://studio.code.org/s/dance-extras/stage/1/puzzle/4": "# Dance Crews\n\nHere's a dance off between two crews. The arrow keys control one of the dancers and the \"w,a,s,d\" keys control the other. Have a dance off with a friend, and then try to improve this dance off.\n\n-   Add more keys to control dances\n-   Make the backup dancers also respond when the keys are pressed\n-   Alternate the dancer every 4 measures by setting their visibility",
    "https://studio.code.org/s/dance-extras/stage/1/puzzle/5": "# Quarter Notes\n\nMost of our dances have used whole measures, but each measure is made up of 4 quarter notes. This dance uses `every 0.25 measures` to make the dancer clap on every quarter note.\n\nThis dance also uses a _conditional_ block to control when the `every 0.25 measures` block can change the dance. Try changing the numbers in the conditional block to see how it changes the dance.\n\n-   Experiment with other note durations (like 0.5 for a half note or 0.125 for an eighth note).\n-   Add some `after measure` events.\n-   Switch \"measures\" with \"seconds\" and try timing your dances that way.",
    "https://studio.code.org/s/dance-extras/stage/1/puzzle/6": "# Bass, Mid, and Treble\n\nThis dance uses \"peak\" events to trigger code when different parts of the music get loud. Try tinkering with different songs to see how they change the dance.",
    "https://studio.code.org/s/dance-extras/stage/1/puzzle/7": "# Speed it Up, Slow it Down\n\nThis final dance uses the `set speed` block to control how fast each dancer moves. Try experimenting with different speeds during different points in the song. Feel free to keep tinkering on this dance, or return to any of the previous dances to make them even cooler."
