      Máy tính có ở khắp mọi nơi, nhưng chỉ một số ít các trường học dạy về khoa học máy tính 10 năm trở về trước. Good news is, we’re on our way to change this. If you heard about the Hour of Code last year, you might know it made history. In one week, 15 million students tried computer science!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Computer science was on homepages of Google, MSN, Yahoo! and Disney. President Obama, Shakira and Ashton Kutcher all kicked off the Hour of Code with videos. Over 100 partners came together to support this movement.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This year, let's make it even bigger. I’m asking you to join in for the Hour of Code 2014. Please get involved with an Hour of Code event during Computer Science Education Week, December 8-14, 2014.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Get the word out. Host an event. Ask a local school to sign up. Or try the Hour of Code yourself -- everyone can benefit from learning the basics.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Help us reach 100 million students by the end of the year! Get started at http://hourofcode.com/<%= @country %>

      Computers are everywhere, but fewer schools teach computer science than 10 years ago. Girls and minorities are severely underrepresented. Good news is, we’re on our way to change this.

      Dear Parents,
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We live in a world surrounded by technology. And we know that whatever field our students choose to go into as adults, their ability to succeed will increasingly hinge on understanding how technology works. But only a tiny fraction of us are learning computer science, and less students are studying it than a decade ago.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      That’s why our entire school is joining in on the largest learning event in history: The Hour of Code, during Computer Science Education Week (Dec. 8-14). Last year, 15 million students tried computer science in one week. This year, we're joining students worldwide to reach 100 million students!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Our Hour of Code is a statement that [SCHOOL NAME] is ready to teach these foundational 21st century skills. To continue bringing programming activities to your students, we want to make our Hour of Code event huge. I encourage you to volunteer, reach out to local media, share the news on your social media channels and consider hosting additional Hour of Code events in the community.
    </p>

      This is a chance to change the future of education in [TOWN/CITY NAME].

      Dear [Mayor/Governor/Representative/Senator LAST NAME]:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Did you know that in today’s economy, computing jobs outnumber students graduating into the field by 3-to-1? And, computer science is foundational for <em>every</em> industry today. Yet 90% of schools don’t teach it. At [SCHOOL NAME], we are trying to change that.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      That’s why our entire school is joining in on the largest learning event in history: The Hour of Code, during Computer Science Education Week (Dec. 8-14). Last year, 15 million students tried computer science in one week. This year, we're joining students worldwide to reach 100 million students!

      I'm writing to invite you to take part in our Hour of Code event and speak at our kickoff assembly. It’ll take place on [DATE, TIME, PLACE], and will make a strong statement that [State or City name] is ready to teach our students critical 21st century skills. We want to ensure that our students are on the forefront of creating technology of the future--not just consuming it.
