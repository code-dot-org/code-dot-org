## Key Tips

- Email liên lạc với giới truyền thông 2 tuần trước khi sự kiện diễn ra. Theo dõi Emali và điện thoại nếu chưa nhận được hồi đáp ngay.
- Nhờ một thành viên trường bạn hoặc tình nguyện viên chụp ảnh chia sẻ trực tuyến hoặc gửi cho báo chí.
- Viết về Hour of Code - Giờ lập trình trên trang web và trong tờ báo trường bạn. Gửi CHI tiết về sự kiện, những hình ảnh về các hoạt động sinh viên.
- On Facebook and Twitter, share updates on your plans, announce your events, and post pictures during {{ campaign_date/year }}. Use the hashtag **#HourOfCode** so Code.org can see and promote your events.

## Step-by-step guide

### 1. Plan your event

- Lên kế hoạch tuần tự để khởi động Hour of Code.
- Send [a letter]({{ promote/sample_emails }}) to parents and ask them to spread the word.
- Send [a letter]({{ promote/sample_emails }}) to invite your local mayor, member of Congress, governor, or influential businessperson to attend and speak to your students.
- Tổ chức các hoạt động của nhóm (như là tổ chức một hoạt động hỏi đáp về lập trình), hoặc hướng dẫn sinh viên tự tổ chức các hoạt động.
- Show Code.org’s [Hour of Code video]({{ urls/home }}) or one of [these videos]({{ promote/videos }}) to inspire students. <br />

### 2. Identify specific reporters that cover education or local events

Like local newspapers, TV station or radio stations, or blogs. <br />

### 3. Contact local media

The best way to reach out is by email. It should be short and should communicate "why should other people care about this event"? Include contact information (including a cellphone number) for who will be on site at the event. **[See a sample pitch to media]({{ promote/press-kit-emails }})**.

Look online to find reporter contact information. If you can't find it, call the publication to ask, or email the organization's general email address and ask for your message to be directed to the correct reporter. <br />

### 4. Prepare to field questions about your school event. Here are some examples:

#### Why is your school doing an Hour of Code?

While all of us know that it’s important for students to learn how to navigate today’s tech-saturated world, many teachers aren’t experienced in computer science and don’t know where to start. This event is a chance for all of us to see what computer science is about.

We hope it’ll spark interest in students to keep learning. Research also shows that kids can pick up programming concepts before they know how to read and write. In fact, their brains are more receptive to computer languages at a young age, just like foreign languages. <br /> <br />

#### Why is this important?

Technology is transforming every industry on the planet. In 2015, 7 million openings in the U.S. were in occupations—including art and design—that value coding skills. But 60 percent of schools in the U.S. don't teach computer science. It’s time for us to catch up to the 21st-century. We know that regardless of what our students do when they grow up, whether they go into medicine, business, politics, or the arts, knowing how to build technology will give them confidence and a competitive edge. <br />

## Sample email to send to invite local media to your event

**Subject line**: Local school joins mission to introduce students to computer science

Computers are everywhere, changing every industry on the planet, but fewer than half of all schools teach computer science. Young women and students from marginalized racial and ethnic groups are severely underrepresented in computer science classes, and in the tech industry. Tin tốt là chúng tôi đang trên đường thay đổi điều đó.

With the Hour of Code, computer science has been on homepages of Google, MSN, Yahoo!, and Disney. Over 100 partners have joined together to support this movement. Tất cả Apple Store trên thế giới đều tổ chức Giờ lập trình. Even President Obama wrote his first line of code as part of the campaign.

Đó là lý do tại sao toàn bộ [X number] học sinh tại [SCHOOL NAME] sẽ tham gia vào sự kiện học tập lớn nhất trong lịch sử: Giờ Lập Trình, trong Tuần lễ Giáo dục về Khoa học Máy tính (ngày 3-9 tháng 12).

I'm writing to invite you to attend our kickoff assembly and to see kids start the activity on [DATE].

Giờ lập trình, do tổ chức phi lợi nhuận Code.org và hơn 100 tổ chức khác triển khai, là một phong trào toàn cầu với niềm tin rằng học sinh ngày nay đã sẵn sàng học các kỹ năng quan trọng để đạt được thành công trong thế kỷ 21. Please join us.

I look forward to being in touch. <br />

## Additional details and a quote you can use in materials

"The Hour of Code is designed to demystify code and show that computer science is not rocket science—anybody can learn the basics," said Hadi Partovi, founder and CEO of Code.org. "Over 100 million students worldwide have tried an Hour of Code. The demand for relevant 21st-century computer science education crosses all borders and knows no boundaries." <br /> <br />

#### About Code.org

Code.org is a 501c3 public non-profit dedicated to expanding participation in computer science and increasing participation by young women and students from other underrepresented groups. Its vision is that every student in every school has the opportunity to learn computer programming. After launching in 2013, Code.org organized the Hour of Code campaign – which has introduced over 100 million students to computer science to date – and partnered with 70 public school districts nationwide to expand computer science programs. Code.org is supported by philanthropic donations from corporations, foundations and generous individuals, including Microsoft, Facebook, Infosys Foundation USA, Amazon, and others.
