    maze_intro:
      1:
        text: "Welcome to your first hour of code! Let's dive right into your first taste of programming."
      2:
        text: "We'll be using Blockly, a visual programming language where you drag and drop blocks to write code."
      3:
        text: "Most code is typed, but Blockly is visual. Each blocks corresponds to a line of \"real\" code."
      4:
        text: "You'll learn the foundations of computer science, concepts which are used anywhere from making apps to controlling the Mars rover."
      5:
        text: "A program is a set of instructions for your computer to follow."
      6:
        text: "The goal of your first program is to get an Angry Bird through a maze to hit a Green Pig."
      7:
        text: "The left side is the maze where your program is run. The instructions for each puzzle are below the maze."
      8:
        text: "The middle toolbox has the commands for the Angry Bird. You'll use these to build your code."
      9:
        text: "On the right is your workspace where you'll drag blocks from the toolbox to build your program. To delete a block, drag it to the trash in the corner."
      10:
        text: "Each block is one instruction. If you drag a \"move forward\" block to your workspace and press \"Run Program\", the bird moves one space on the maze."
      11:
        text: "To do more than one action, you can drag many blocks to your workspace and attach them together. The bird will do the commands from top to bottom."
      12:
        text: "If you run a program and want to fix it and try again, press the \"Reset\" button."
      13:
        text: "Let's go get those pigs!"
    artist_intro:
      1:
        text: "Hi, I'm JR! Every race car team need computer scientists to win. They analyze data from the car to make it go faster."
      2:
        text: "In these puzzles, you'll be an artist that draws a line behind them everywhere they go."
      3:
        text: "This block says \"move forward by 100 pixels.\" Pixels are just really tiny dots on your screen."
      4:
        text: "This block says \"turn right by 90 degrees.\" This will turn your artist the same amount as the \"turn\" blocks in the maze puzzles."
      5:
        text: "Click on the arrow in either of these blocks to change the amount the artist moves forward or turns. Play around to get familiar with these new blocks."
    farmer_intro:
      1:
        text: "Hi, I'm Paola! In these puzzles, you're a farmer who has to get her field completely flat to start planting crops."
      2:
        text: "You have to help her remove all the piles of dirt and fill in all the holes."
      3:
        text: "The new blocks remove 1 shovelful of dirt from a pile and fill in 1 shovelful of dirt to a hole."
      4:
        text: "The piles and holes are different sizes, so you have to tell the farmer how many shovelfuls to use."
    flappy_intro:
      1:
        text: "Hi, I'm Katie! One of the most exciting things about computer science is that a computer program can be interactive."
      2:
        text: "Any time somebody clicks or taps or types on a computer or phone, that generates an EVENT, and there's some code that decides what to do when an EVENT occurs."
      3:
        text: "For example, you could have an EVENT-HANDLER that says \"when the mouse is clicked, play a sound\" "
      4:
        text: "Have you ever heard of the game FlappyBird? By using Event handlers, we're going to learn to program our own custom version of FlappyBird!"
      5:
        text: "The code you'll write involves dragging and dropping blocks that represent commands for the computer. Under the hood, each of these blocks is represented by real code."
      6:
        text: "If you take a look at the workspace, there are some green blocks that are filled in for you - these are \"event handlers\" "
      7:
        text: "If you want the bird to FLAP when you CLICK the mouse, you can do that by attaching the \"FLAP\" block to the appropriate event handler, and now in your game whenever you click the mouse, the bird will flap."
      8:
        text: "In each puzzle of this activity we'll introduce new types of events as green blocks on the workspace, and you can decide the appropriate blocks to add in response to those events."
      9:
        text: "When you see a drop down arrow like this, that means you can change the settings - like what sound to play when flappy hits the ground."
      10:
        text: "In the final puzzle you'll be able to create your own game and share it with your friends. रमाईलो गर्नुहोस्!"
    loop_times:
      1:
        text: "Hi, I'm Mark! Let's learn about loops. Using loops you can tell a computer to repeat any set of actions over and over, thousands or even billions of times."
      2:
        text: "In this puzzle, we want to make the bird move forward 5 spaces to get to the pig."
      3:
        text: "We can use the new \"repeat\" block to help us out."
      4:
        text: "Instead of dragging out 5 \"move forward\" blocks..."
      5:
        text: "We can put the \"move forward\" block inside the \"repeat\" block and write a number in the block to tell it how many times to repeat."
      6:
        text: "And this is important: you can put more than one command inside a \"repeat\" block."
      7:
        text: "Enjoy using your new \"repeat\" block!"
    loop_until:
      1:
        text: "Hi, I'm Chris. Before joining the Miami Heat, I went to Georgia Tech to study Computer Science. Let's try our new block, the \"repeat until\" block."
      2:
        text: "What if we didn't know how far the bird had to move to get to the pig?"
      3:
        text: "If we put a \"move forward\" block inside the \"repeat until\" block, the bird will move forward UNTIL it reaches the pig (or crashes into a wall)."
      4:
        text: 'And this is important: just like before, we can put multiple blocks inside the "repeat until" block, and they will all be repeated.'
    if:
      1:
        text: "Hi, I'm Bill! Let's learn a new fundamental concept: \"If\" statements. This is how computers make decisions."
      2:
        text: "You use \"If\" statements yourself everday. Before you go outside each morning, you say IF it's raining outside, I need to wear my jacket."
      3:
        text: "We can tell the zombie to check IF there's path to the left, and if he finds a path to the left, we can have him turn in that direction."
      4:
        text: "To write the code for this, let's drag out our \"if\" block and put a \"turn left\" block inside it."
      5:
        text: "Now, if we put a \"move forward\" block above it and a \"repeat\" block around everything, each time the zombie moves, he'll check if there's a path to the left and turn. The \"repeat\" command is critical, to check for a turn at every step."
      6:
        text: "If statements are really important in computer science. One of the first programs I wrote was a tic-tac-toe game, and there was a If statement that said IF the other person is about to win, block the spot that lets them win."
      7:
        text: "Have fun using the \"if\" block!"
    if_else:
      1:
        text: "Hi, my name is Saloni. I use computer science to help solve problems in health and medicine. Let's learn about the \"if else\" block. It looks like the \"if\" block, but it has an extra part at the end that says \"else\"."
      2:
        text: "If I put a \"move forward\" block in the spot where it says \"do\" and a \"turn left\" block where it says \"else\" that means that the zombie will choose between 2 options. IF there is a path ahead, the zombie will move forward, and OTHERWISE (there isn't a path ahead), the zombie will turn left."
      3:
        text: "Just like the \"if\" block, we can put \"if else\" blocks inside a \"repeat\" blocks so that the zombie keeps moving and the \"if else\" block will keep checking if there's somewhere to turn."
      4:
        text: "Now, get those zombies where they belong!"
    if_else_scrat:
      1:
        text: "An if-else statement is a decision between two things. Let's see how we can use an if-else statement with our buddy Scrat the squirrel."
      2:
        text: "This block looks the same as the \"if\" block, but there's an extra part at the bottom that says \"else\". If I put a \"move forward\" block where it says \"do\" and a \"turn left\" block where it says \"else\", that means Scrat the squirrel will move forward if there's a path ahead. If there's not a path ahead, Scrat will turn left."
      3:
        text: "It's making a decision and doing one of the two actions based on that decision. And just like \"if\" blocks, you can put \"if-else\" blocks inside \"repeat\" blocks."
      4:
        text: "Now let's help Scrat the squirrel get that acorn!"
    function:
      1:
        text: "Hi, I'm Brina, an engineer at Instagram. A function is certain lines of code that you want to use over and over again, so instead of writing that code out everytime, you can just use one block."
      2:
        text: "We're going to learn how to define functions. Function definitions have a star in the corner. The name of the function is written on the top line."
      3:
        text: "The blocks that go inside the definition tell us what it does. So this function definition is called \"fill 5\" and it's made up of a \"repeat\" block and a \"fill\" block."
      4:
        text: "The definition sits on the workspace, but our farmer won't run the function until we drag out our \"fill 5\" function block from functions category."
      5:
        text: "Let's put the \"fun\" back in \"FUNction!\" "
    loop_while:
      1:
        text: "Hi, I'm Makinde! Let's learn about the \"while block.\" "
      2:
        text: "The \"while block\" will do whatever you put inside it AS LONG AS the statement on the top is TRUE."
      3:
        text: "For example, if the farmer is standing on a pile, she will continue to remove 1 shovelful WHILE there is still a pile beneath her."
    loop_for:
      1:
        text: "Hi, I'm Trina, and I work for Pixar. I've worked on a bunch of movies, including Shrek."
      2:
        text: "This is our new \"counter\" loop. It will perform actions over and over again and you can make the actions change slightly each time."
      3:
        text: "In this example, our \"counter\" loop says \"count with counter from 50 to 90 by 10\" and inside it, we have our \"draw a square\" block. Drag the \"counter\" block from the \"Variables\" section into the \"length\" spot."
      4:
        text: "This means our artist is going to draw a square that has 50 pixel length sides, then it will add 10 to that and draw a square with 60 pixel length sides. Then it will keep adding 10 and drawing squares until it reaches 90. So we'll have squares of 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90."
    parameters:
      1:
        text: "Hi, I'm Janete, and I'm an engineer at Zynga."
      2:
        text: "What if we want to draw a bunch of triangles and have their lengths be different sizes?"
      3:
        text: "We could write all that code out by hand or we can use a function with parameters."
      4:
        text: "To do this, click the blue star on the \"draw a triangle\" function definition. Then drag \"input name\" into the \"input\" block."
      5:
        text: "Then if you write \"length\" in the spot where it says \"x\" and press \"Enter\" you'll create a length input for your function."
      6:
        text: "Then click on the star. Now, you want to click on the variables category and drag the \"length\" block into the \"move forward\" block of your function definition. And drag away the old number block."
      7:
        text: "To use your function with parameters, click on the functions category and drag out your \"draw a triangle with length\" function."
      8:
        text: "Now you can use the math block to input different numbers to draw triangles of different sizes."
    hoc_wrapup:
      1:
        text: "Congratulations! With the last puzzle you solved, you just wrote code that can tell ANY robot how to find it's way through a non-branching maze or tunnel of any length, whether it's a zombie, a bird, a mars rover, or even a self-driving car."
      2:
        text: "The basic concepts you used are at the heart of every program or app you'll ever try.  We learned about repeat loops, repeat until statements, if statements, and if else statements."
      3:
        text: "If you liked your first hour of code, visit code.org to continue your education into computer science! Once you complete our 20 hour course, you'll have mastered the basics of programming, and can start learning how to write phone apps, robot instructions, games, you name it."
      4:
        text: "Technology is changing everything we do and it doesn't matter if you're young or old: programming is fun, it's creative, and anyone can learn!"

    frozen_intro:
      1:
        text: "Hi, my name is Lyndsey. I model, act, and write my own apps. Let's use code to join Anna and Elsa as they explore the magic and beauty of ice."
      2:
        text: "You'll create snowflakes and patterns as you ice skate and make a winter wonderland that you can then share with your friends."
      3:
        text: "In the next hour, you're going to learn the basics of how to code. Traditional programming is usually in text, but we'll use Blockly, which uses visual blocks that you can drag and drop to write programs. This is how even university students learn the basics. Under the hood, you're still creating code."
      4:
        text: "A program is a set of instructions that tells a computer what to do. Let's build a code, or a program, that will help Elsa create a simple line. We will use this later to create more complex patterns."
      5:
        text: "Your screen is split into three main parts. On the left, is the ice surface where you'll run your program. The instructions for each level are written right below the surface."
      6:
        text: "This middle area is the toolbox, and each of these blocks is an action that Elsa and Anna can do."
      7:
        text: "The white space on the right is called the workspace, and this is where we'll build our program. To move around the ice surface, you'll use the \"Move Forward\" block."
      8:
        text: "Here, the \"Move Forward\" block says, \"move forward by 100 pixels.\" When we press \"Run\", what happens? Elsa moves forward a certain amount on the screen, 100 pixels in fact! Pixels are basically very tiny squares on your computer screen."
      9:
        text: "The other block we have in this puzzle says \"turn right by 90 degrees.\" And when we use this \"Turn Right\" block, that makes Elsa turn a certain amount. You can play around with how far you want Elsa to turn. The angle is measured from the path ahead of Elsa. So, this is a 90 degree turn. And this is a 120 degree turn."
      10:
        text: "Remember, you can change the number of pixels and degrees by clicking the arrows next to them."
    frozen_loops:
      1:
        text: "Hi, I’m Paola! Computers are really good at repeating actions. You can count to 10, 20, or 100. But a computer can count to a billion or a trillion. It won't get bored and it will only take a few seconds. Whether it's counting, or drawing, or anything--computers can repeat things hundreds or even billions of times."
      2:
        text: "In programming, we call this a loop. A loop is how you repeat your code over and over again. For the next puzzle, your goal is to help Anna create a square with the \"Repeat\" block."
      3:
        text: "Any blocks of code you put inside the \"Repeat\" block will be repeated in sequence, as many times as you want."
      4:
        text: "To draw a square, you can use the \"Move Forward\" and \"Turn Right\" block 4 times. But the easier way is to tell the computer to \"Move Forward\" and \"Turn Right by 90 degrees\" once, and then tell it to repeat this pair of actions 4 times. To do that, you need to put the \"Move Forward\" and \"Turn Right\" block inside a \"Repeat\" block."
      5:
        text: "Remember, you can change the number in the \"Repeat\" block to anything, and it will repeat what's inside the block that many times."
    frozen_functions:
      1:
        text: "Hi, I’m Chris Bosh. I’m a professional basketball player, and I coded in college."
      2:
        text: "One of the most important concepts in computer science is how to define new commands. Most computer languages have only about 100 words or commands. And really, the art and magic is in defining your own new words out of these building blocks."
      3:
        text: "Once you've taught a computer how to do an action once using this sequence of commands, you can make up your own name for that action so it's easy to repeat it later. When you define your own command and give it a name, that's called a function."
      4:
        text: "Hi, I’m Jess. When programming with blocks, you would use functions if there are a set of actions you would like to use lots of times. For example, you've written code to create a square."
      5:
        text: "You can define this as a function called \"create a square.\" "
      6:
        text: "Now you have a new block that you can use multiple times to create multiple squares."
      7:
        text: "A lot of simple shapes can be used to create more complex patterns. In the next puzzle, the code you recently wrote to make a circle is available to you as a new function that can make circles of different sizes. Can you use it to help Elsa create intricate and beautiful patterns in the snow?"
    playlab_intro:
      1:
        text: "We're going to create games using Play Lab. Good games have a story, and every story has actors. We'll learn how to make our actors like witches, alinens, and animals speak, move, and interact with each other. By the end of this tutorial, you can build a game from scratch and share it with your friends."
      2:
        text: "Your screen is split into 3 main parts. On the left is the game space where your program will run. The instructions for each level are written below."
      3:
        text: "The middle area is the toolbox, and each of these blocks is a piece of code. The white space on the right is called the workspace and this is where we'll build our program."
      4:
        text: "To start off, you'll need to link your blocks to the orange \"when run\" block. You can link multiple blocks together by dragging them out until you see the yellow line, and then they'll snap together."
      5:
        text: "In this first puzzle, our actor is a penguin and we'll be making it say \"Hello!\" by dragging the say block out, linking it to the when run block, and typing in \"Hello.\" We can also make the penguin move by using the move right and move left blocks. Once you have your blocks in place, hit the run button to see what you've programmed."
      6:
        text: "Get started and by the end, you'll be able to create your own game with all kinds of players that can interact, turn happy or sad, score points, or throw fireballs, or even vanish each other. It's all up to you and the game you want to make."
    playlab_events:
      1:
        text: "Now, we're going to learn about something that all game programmers use everyday. They're called events. An event tells your program to listen for when something happens. When that thing happens, it performs an action."
      2:
        text: "Some examples of events are listening for a mouse click, an arrow button, or a tap on the screen."
      3:
        text: "Here, we're going to make the space bot greet the earthlings when a player clicks on him. We'll use the \"when clicked\" block and attach the \"say\" block to it. When the player clicks on the space bot, everything attached to this \"when clicked\" event block will be performed. What does your alien say?"
      4:
        text: "There are also \"when arrow\" blocks. If you link the \"move\" blocks to these, you can start to move your actors up, down, left, or right. Step by step, your game is getting more interactive."
    playlab_repeat_forever:
      1:
        text: "This is the \"repeat forever\" block. Anything inside this block will happen forever in the game."
      2:
        text: "If we want an actor to do something repeatedly, without the player having to do anything, we'll put those blocks inside the \"repeat forever\" block."
      3:
        text: "In this next puzzle, our goal is to help the wizard patrol the boundaries of the kingdom, left and right continuously. Learning how the repeat commands works, will save you a ton of time later when you build your own game."
    C1_artist_intro:
      1:
        text: "These are your draw blocks. Use the correct one to move the artist where he needs to go to fill in the grey lines."
      2:
        text: "These are jump blocks. When you use these, your artist moves but doesn't draw, so use these to jump to the next grey line."
    C1_bee_level_intro:
      1:
        text: "Aren't bees super cool? In this next set of puzzles, your goal is to help the bee get to the flowers and get nectar from the flowers and fly over to the honeycomb to make honey. You'll need to use the \"get nectar\" and the \"make honey\" blocks for this exercise."
      2:
        text: "Every flower has a different number of nectars: 1, 2, 3, or more. We know how much nectar is in the red flowers, by the little number in the corner. So be sure to get all the nectar from the flower before you move forward. Also, every honeycomb can only hold so much honey: 1, 2, 3, or more. So be sure to make as much honey as the honeycomb can hold."
      3:
        text: "If you're able to get all the nectar and make all the honey, you succeed and go to the next level. Otherwise, you need to try this puzzle again. Play around a while and see what it feels like to \"bee\" a programmer!"
    C1_bee_loops:
      1:
        text: "A loop is a repetition of activity. So going into a hive to inspect, I look at a frame and then I put it back, so I repeat that same activity multiple times. It's looping around, doing the same activity multiple times."
      2:
        text: "In this level, we want the bee to collect three nectars from the flower. Instead of using three \"get nectar\" blocks, you're going to use the repeat block to get nectar three times. Hit \"Run\" and see if you got it right. Nice!"
    C1_bigevent_unplugged:
      1:
        text: "This lesson is called the big event. It's all about how we can control our programs and actually change the way a program runs on the fly using events, like the push of a button or the click of a mouse."
      2:
        text: "For this lesson, you'll be controlled with a paper remote control. It's just like a real-live video game."
      3:
        text: "An event is an action  that causes something to happen. It's like when you click the button on a mouse and a webpage loads. That's an event. When you touch your screen on a tablet to scroll, that's an event also. Events are a great way of letting the user direct your program whenever they need or want to."
      4:
        text: "Things happen that we all respond to. We feel hungry and we go to the fridge. We hear the mailman come and he puts our mail in the mailbox  and then we go get our mail. Those are just like the events of pushing a button or moving a joystick. They are something that happens that triggers us to do something."
      5:
        text: "In video games, there's an event called \"Update\" and it happens 30 or 60 times a second. For videogame programmers that's almost more important as an event than the buttons or the joystick."
      6:
        text: "The main event we're watching for is that \"Update\" tick happening. And then we check the joystick in the tick. So we say, \"Oh, has somebody pushed the button this frame? Yes or no?\" Without events, the player couldn't move, you couldn't jump, you wouldn't be able to control what's going on. The videogame wouldn't be able to animate anything."
    C1_building_foundation:
      1:

That's why each step has to be written down, so no matter who does it, the result is the same."
