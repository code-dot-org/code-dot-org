        Let's try it again! \\r
        \\r
        Can you
        set the `length` variable to 60 to make this cool design with hexagons?
      grade5_artist_variables_pentagon9: |-
        Now, recreate the algorithm from
        the last level and create a pentagon with sides of length 150.
      grade5_artist_variables_pentagons1: |-
        Draw this pattern of pentagons with
        100 pixel sides by setting the right value for `length` and dropping the `length`
        variable into all of the the correct places. \\r
        \\r
        See how you only have
        to set the value for `length` once, and the code uses the right value everywhere?
      grade5_playlab_variables13: |-
        Use the `when actor touches` block
        to send Dog back to the top-left ONLY if Dog touches any of the other actors.
      grade5_playlab_variables2: |-
        The race in that last puzzle wasn't
        very fair! Change the `dog_speed` variable to make sure you can collect more
        flags than Cat. The first to collect 10 flags wins!
      grade5_playlab_variables9: |-
        Here's a function called `patrol`.
        \\r
        \\r
        Edit `patrol` to move Cat up 400 pixels and then down 400 pixels.
      level 'grade3_Loops_3: Use a `repeat` loop to collect all of the nectar.
      level 'grade3_Loops_4: |-
        Now use the `repeat` block to collect all of
        the nectar and make all of the honey.
      level 'grade3_Loops_6: |-
        How many times can loops help you in this puzzle?  \\r
        \\r
        Loops
        are your friend! Use a few of them to complete this puzzle with the fewest
        blocks possible.
      level 'grade3_Loops_7: |-
        Those flowers look tasty!\\r
        \\r
        Collect nectar
        from each of the flowers using the fewest blocks possible.
