      2-3level1: Help the bird catch the naughty pig by moving it forward
      20hr_farmer_stage9_1: Hi, I'm a farmer. I need your help to flatten the field on my farm so it's ready for planting. Move me to the pile of dirt and use the "remove" block to remove it.
      20hr_farmer_stage9_11: 'It''s still dark outside. Move me along the field. If there is a pile, remove it, and if there is a hole, fill it in. Hint: use the dropdown menu of options on the "if" block.'

      20hr_farmer_stage9_3: Move me to the pile of dirt and tell me how many shovelfuls to remove using as few blocks as possible.
      20hr_farmer_stage9_4: 'Can you help me remove all four piles of dirt? Hint: use a repeat block if you can.'
      20hr_farmer_stage9_5: 'Help me fill in all these holes with 5 shovelfuls of dirt. Hint: you can put a "repeat" block inside the "while" block.'
      20hr_farmer_stage9_6: Remove all the piles of dirt, using as few blocks as possible. The new options in the dropdown menu on the "while" block tell me if I'm standing on a pile or a hole.

      20hr_maze_stage2_14: 'Use the new "if" block to let me decide when to turn. Hint: you only need one more block, but learn how we set it up so you can do it on your own next time.'
      20hr_maze_stage2_15: Ok, this is just like the last puzzle, but you need to remember how you used the "if" block and the "repeat" block together.
      20hr_maze_stage2_16: Me want sunflower! Use an "if" block to get me there with the fewest number of blocks.

      20hr_maze_stage2_4: Guide me to the green evilness! (Watch out for TNT)
      20hr_maze_stage2_5: Keep calm and help me to find the bad pig. Otherwise I might get angry!
      20hr_maze_stage2_6: There's a way I can get to the silly pig using only 2 blocks. Can you figure it out?
      20hr_maze_stage2_7: Try to get me to the green intruder using only three blocks.

        times, turning between each iteration?   Notice that the turns in this shape
        add up to 420 degrees, which means that when your artist is done drawing,

        by setting "points = points + 1." Get your score up to 10 (going one at
