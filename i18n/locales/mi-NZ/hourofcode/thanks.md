# Tēnā koe i tō waitohu mai ki te taurima i tētahi Hour of Code!

<br /> **The Hour of Code runs during {{ campaign_date/full }} and we'll be in touch about new tutorials and other exciting updates as they come out. In the meantime, what can you do now?**

## 1. Spread the word in your school and community

{{ social_media_hoc }} <br /> Encourage others to participate [with our sample emails.]({{ promote/sample_emails }}) Contact your principal and challenge every classroom at your school to sign up. Recruit a local group — boy/girl scouts club, church, university, veterans group, labor union, or even some friends. Ehara i te mea me noho ki tētahi kura ki te ako i ētahi pūkenga hou. Invite a local politician or policy maker to visit your school for the Hour of Code. Mā tēnei ka tautoko i ngā mahi pūtaiao rorohiko i tō takiwā haere ake nei.

Use these [posters, banners, stickers, videos and more]({{ promote/resources }}) for your own event.
