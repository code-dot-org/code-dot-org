# Indlela yoku letha Ihora loKufingqwa eKampanini yakho

## Gqugquzela abafundi kanye nabazinikelayo ngeHora loKufingqwa

**Code.org offers company employees the opportunity to [connect](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/volunteer') %) with local classrooms doing the Hour of Code to share their tech career experience and inspire students to study computer science.**

  * [Coka](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/volunteer') %) ukuzinikela.
  * Ngemilayelo ebanzi ngokuxhumanisa abasebenzi bakho namagumbi okufundela, xoxisana ne [ziluleko zabasebenzisana ngokwehwebo](%= localized_file('/files/HourOfCodeGuideForCorporatePartners.pdf') %).

## Izindlela ezingezilwe izinkampani ezingaxasa ngayo iHora loKufingqwa:

  * Sebenzisa [amathulusi okwenza indali](%= localized_file('/files/HourOfCodeInternalMarketingToolkit.pdf') %) ukuze udale isikhathi sokuxhumana kanye nokwabelana ngokuqukethwe ukukhangisa.
  * Cela Umphathi Omkhulu wakho athumelele i-imeyili kububanzi bonke benkampani egcizelela ukubaluleka wekhompyutha sayensi iphinde ikhuthaze abasebenzi ukuthi basasaze nezwi. [Bheka le imeyili lena](%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#sample-emails') %).
  * Hlela Ihora Lokuzithokozisa leHora loKufingqwa kanye nosebenzanabo ukuzama i [izifundiso](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/learn') %).
  * Hlelela ikilasi labafundi bendawo umcimbi weHora loKufingqwa okanye uthole abalingani abanga funi inzuzo ukuba benze iHora loKufingqwa kukantolo yamahovizi akho. Bona indlela yokwenza lapha ezansi.

## Umcimbi weHora loKufingqwa uholwa kanjani

## 1) Khuthaza iHora loKufingqwa lwakho

  * Khuthaza wakho [iHora loKufingqwa](%= resolve_url('/promote') %) umcimbi ubese ukhuthaza obanye ukuba bahlele.
  * Gqugquzela **onjiniyela besofthiwe** kunkampani yakho ukuba bavakashele ikilasi ledolobha ukuba basize ukuhola iHora loKufingqwa kanye nokufaka ugqozi kubafundi ukuba bafunde ikhompyutha sayensi. Banga [bhalisa](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/volunteer/engineer') %) ukuba baxhunyiswane nekilasi.

## 2) Bukela levidiyo yendlela yokuqondisa <iframe width="500" height="255" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/SrnvvWDm73k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
## 3) Khetha isifundiso:

We’ll host a variety of [fun, hour-long tutorials](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/learn') %) for participants of all ages, created by a variety of partners. [Zizamele wona!](%= resolve_url("https://code.org/learn") %)

**All Hour of Code tutorials:**

  * Require minimal prep-time
  * Are self-guided - allowing participants to work at their own pace and skill-level

## 4) Hlela izidingo zakho zobuchwepheshe - amakhompyutha ayakhetheka

Eyonandlela enhle kakhulu yokuthokozela iHora loKufingqwa ibandakanya nokuxhumana ngakhompyutha aneinternet. But you **don’t** need a computer for every participant, and you can even do the Hour of Code without a computer at all.

** Lungiselela Phambilini!** Yenza lokhu ngaphambi kokucala komcimbi wakho:

  * Test tutorials on computers or devices. Make sure they work properly on browsers with sound and video.
  * Provide headphones, or ask participants to bring their own, if the tutorial you choose works best with sound.
  * **Don't have enough devices?** Use [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q). When participants partner up, they help each other and rely less on the organizer. They’ll also see that computer science is social and collaborative.
  * **Have low bandwidth?** Plan to show videos at the front of the event, so each participant isn't downloading their own videos. Or try the unplugged / offline tutorials.

## 5) Start your Hour of Code off with an inspiring video

Kick off your Hour of Code by inspiring participants and discussing how computer science impacts every part of our lives. Share more about what inspired you to pursue computer science and your role at your company.

**Show an inspirational video:**

  * The original Code.org launch video, featuring Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and NBA star Chris Bosh (There are [1 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYZF6oIZtfc), [5 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc), and [9 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1xS07N-FA) versions)
  * The [Hour of Code 2013 launch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC5FbmsH4fw), or the <% if @country == 'uk' %> [Hour of Code 2015 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L97YMYqLHc) <% else %> [Hour of Code 2015 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L97YMYqLHc) <% end %>
  * [President Obama calling on all students to learn computer science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvmhE1J9PY)
  * Find more inspirational video [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNfpD8i4Sx7U0y2MccnrNZuP).

**Ideas to introduce your Hour of Code activity:**

  * Explain ways technology impacts our lives, with examples both boys and girls will care about (Talk about technology that’s saving lives, helping people, connecting people). 
  * If you are a tech company, demo fun, innovative products your company is working on.
  * If you aren’t a tech company, discuss ways your company uses technology to solve problems and accomplish goals.
  * Invite software engineers from your company to speak about why they decided to study computer science and the projects they work on.
  * See tips for getting girls interested in computer science [here](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/girls') %).

## 6) Code!

**Direct participants to the activity**

  * Write the tutorial link on a whiteboard. Find the link listed on the [information for your selected tutorial](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/learn') %) under the number of participants.
  * For younger students, load the tutorial page ahead of time or save it as a bookmark.

**When participants come across difficulties it's okay to respond:**

  * “I don’t know. Let’s figure this out together.”
  * “Technology doesn’t always work out the way we want.”
  * “Learning to program is like learning a new language; you won’t be fluent right away.”

**What to do if someone finishes early?**

  * They can try another Hour of Code activity at code.org/learn
  * Or, ask them to help a friend who are having trouble with the activity.
