      1:
        image: notes/hoc1_1.jpg
        text: "Welcome to your first hour of code! Let's dive right into your first taste of programming."
      2:
        image: notes/hoc1_2.jpg
        text: "We'll be using Blockly, a visual programming language where you drag and drop blocks to write code."
      3:
        image: notes/hoc1_3.jpg
        text: 'Most code is typed, but Blockly is visual. Each blocks corresponds to a line of "real" code.'
      4:
        image: notes/hoc1_4.jpg
        text: "You'll learn the foundations of computer science, concepts which are used anywhere from making apps to controlling the Mars rover."
      5:
        image: notes/hoc1_5.jpg
        text: A program is a set of instructions for your computer to follow.
      6:
        image: notes/hoc1_6.jpg
        text: The goal of your first program is to get an Angry Bird through a maze to hit a Green Pig.
      7:
        image: notes/hoc1_7.jpg
        text: The left side is the maze where your program is run. The instructions for each puzzle are below the maze.
      8:
        image: notes/hoc1_8.jpg
        text: "The middle toolbox has the commands for the Angry Bird. You'll use these to build your code."
      9:
        image: notes/hoc1_9.jpg
        text: "On the right is your workspace where you'll drag blocks from the toolbox to build your program. To delete a block, drag it to the trash in the corner."
      10:
        image: notes/hoc1_10.jpg
        text: 'Each block is one instruction. If you drag a "move forward" block to your workspace and press "Run Program", the bird moves one space on the maze.'
      11:
        image: notes/hoc1_11.jpg
        text: To do more than one action, you can drag many block to your workspace and attach them together. The bird will do the commands from top to bottom.
      12:
        image: notes/hoc1_12.jpg
        text: 'If you run a program and want to fix it and try again, press the "Reset" button.'
      13:
        image: notes/hoc1_13.jpg
        text: "Let's go get those pigs!"
    artist_intro:
      1:
        image: notes/stage5_1.jpg
        text: "Hi, I'm JR! Every race car team need computer scientists to win. They analyze data from the car to make it go faster."
      2:
        image: notes/stage5_2.jpg
        text: "In these puzzles, you'll be an artist that draws a line behind them everywhere they go."
      3:
        image: notes/stage5_3.jpg
        text: 'This block says "move forward by 100 pixels." Pixels are just really tiny dots on your screen.'
      4:
        image: notes/stage5_4.jpg
        text: 'This block says "turn right by 90 degrees." This will turn your artist the same amount as the "turn" blocks in the maze puzzles.'
      5:
        image: notes/stage5_5.jpg
        text: Click on the arrow in either of these blocks to change the amount the artist moves forward or turns. Play around to get familiar with these new blocks.
    farmer_intro:
      1:
        image: notes/stage9_1.jpg
        text: "Hi, I'm Paola! In these puzzles, you're a farmer who has to get her field completely flat to start planting crops."
      2:
        image: notes/stage9_2.jpg
        text: You have to help her remove all the piles of dirt and fill in all the holes.
      3:
        image: notes/stage9_3.jpg
        text: The new blocks remove 1 shovelful of dirt from a pile and fill in 1 shovelful of dirt to a hole.
      4:
        image: notes/stage9_4.jpg
        text: The piles and holes are different sizes, so you have to tell the farmer how many shovelfuls to use.
    flappy_intro:
      1:
        image: notes/flappy01.jpg
        text: "Hi, I'm Katie! One of the most exciting things about computer science is that a computer program can be interactive."
      2:
        image: notes/flappy02.jpg
        text: "Any time somebody clicks or taps or types on a computer or phone, that generates an EVENT, and there's some code that decides what to do when an EVENT occurs."
      3:
        image: notes/flappy03.jpg
        text: 'For example, you could have an EVENT-HANDLER that says "when the mouse is clicked, play a sound" '
      4:
        image: notes/flappy04.jpg
        text: "Have you ever heard of the game FlappyBird? By using Event handlers, we're going to learn to program our own custom version of FlappyBird!"
      5:
        image: notes/flappy05.jpg
        text: "The code you'll write involves dragging and dropping blocks that represent commands for the computer. Under the hood, each of these blocks is represented by real code."
      6:
        image: notes/flappy06.jpg
        text: 'If you take a look at the workspace, there are some green blocks that are filled in for you - these are "event handlers" '
      7:
        image: notes/flappy07.jpg
        text: 'If you want the bird to FLAP when you CLICK the mouse, you can do that by attaching the "FLAP" block to the appropriate event handler, and now in your game whenever you click the mouse, the bird will flap.'
      8:
        image: notes/flappy08.jpg
        text: "In each puzzle of this activity we'll introduce new types of events as green blocks on the workspace, and you can decide the appropriate blocks to add in response to those events."
      9:
        image: notes/flappy09.jpg
        text: 'When you see a drop down arrow like this, that means you can change the settings - like what sound to play when flappy hits the ground.'
      10:
        image: notes/flappy10.jpg
        text: "In the final puzzle you'll be able to create your own game and share it with your friends. Have fun!"
    loop_times:
      1:
        image: notes/hoc2_1.jpg
        text: "Hi, I'm Mark! Let's learn about loops. Using loops you can tell a computer to repeat any set of actions over and over, thousands or even billions of times."
      2:
        image: notes/hoc2_2.jpg
        text: In this puzzle, we want to make the bird move forward 5 spaces to get to the pig.
      3:
        image: notes/hoc2_3.jpg
        text: 'We can use the new "repeat" block to help us out.'
      4:
        image: notes/hoc2_4.jpg
        text: 'Instead of dragging out 5 "move forward" blocks...'
      5:
        image: notes/hoc2_5.jpg
        text: 'We can put the "move forward" block inside the "repeat" block and write a number in the block to tell it how many times to repeat.'
      6:
        image: notes/hoc2_6.jpg
        text: 'And this is important: you can put more than one command inside a "repeat" block.'
      7:
        image: notes/hoc2_7.jpg
        text: 'Enjoy using your new "repeat" block!'
    loop_until:
      1:
        image: notes/hoc3_1.jpg
        text: |-
          Hi, I'm Chris. Before joining the Miami Heat, I went to Georgia Tech to study Computer Science. Let's try our new block, the "repeat until" block.
      2:
        image: notes/hoc3_2.jpg
        text: "What if we didn't know how far the bird had to move to get to the pig?"
      3:
        image: notes/hoc3_3.jpg
        text: 'If we put a "move forward" block inside the "repeat until" block, the bird will move forward UNTIL it reaches the pig (or crashes into a wall).'
      4:
        image: notes/hoc3_4.jpg
        text: 'And this is important: just like before, we can put multiple blocks inside the "repeat until" block, and they will all be repeated.'
    if:
      1:
        image: notes/hoc4_1.jpg
        text: |-
          Hi, I'm Bill! Let's learn a new fundamental concept: "If" statements. This is how computers make decisions.
      2:
        image: notes/hoc4_2.jpg
        text: |-
          You use "If" statements yourself everday. Before you go outside each morning, you say IF it's raining outside, I need to wear my jacket.
      3:
        image: notes/hoc4_3.jpg
        text: "We can tell the zombie to check IF there's path to the left, and if he finds a path to the left, we can have him turn in that direction."
      4:
        image: notes/hoc4_4.jpg
        text: |-
          To write the code for this, let's drag out our "if" block and put a "turn left" block inside it.
      5:
        image: notes/hoc4_5.jpg
        text: |-
          Now, if we put a "move forward" block above it and a "repeat" block around everything, each time the zombie moves, he'll check if there's a path to the left and turn. The "repeat" command is critical, to check for a turn at every step.
      6:
        image: notes/hoc4_6.jpg
        text: If statements are really important in computer science. One of the first programs I wrote was a tic-tac-toe game, and there was a If statement that said IF the other person is about to win, block the spot that lets them win.
      7:
        image: notes/hoc4_7.jpg
        text: 'Have fun using the "if" block!'
    if_else:
      1:
        image: notes/hoc5_1.jpg
        text: |-
          Hi, my name is Saloni. I use computer science to help solve problems in health and medicine. Let's learn about the "if else" block. It looks like the "if" block, but it has an extra part at the end that says "else".
      2:
        image: notes/hoc5_2.jpg
        text: |-
          If I put a "move forward" block in the spot where it says "do" and a "turn left" block where it says "else" that means that the zombie will choose between 2 options. IF there is a path ahead, the zombie will move forward, and OTHERWISE (there isn't a path ahead), the zombie will turn left.
      3:
        image: notes/hoc5_3.jpg
        text: |-
          Just like the "if" block, we can put "if else" blocks inside a "repeat" blocks so that the zombie keeps moving and the "if else" block will keep checking if there's somewhere to turn.
      4:
        image: notes/hoc5_4.jpg
        text: Now, get those zombies where they belong!
    function:
      1:
        image: notes/stage13_1.jpg
        text: "Hi, I'm Brina, an engineer at Instagram. A function is certain lines of code that you want to use over and over again, so instead of writing that code out everytime, you can just use one block."
      2:
        image: notes/stage13_2.jpg
        text: "We're going to learn how to define functions. Function definitions have a star in the corner. The name of the function is written on the top line."
      3:
        image: notes/stage13_3.jpg
        text: |-
          The blocks that go inside the definition tell us what it does. So this function definition is called "fill 5" and it's made up of a "repeat" block and a "fill" block.
      4:
        image: notes/stage13_4.jpg
        text: |-
          The definition sits on the workspace, but our farmer won't run the function until we drag out our "fill 5" function block from functions category.
      5:
        image: notes/stage13_5.jpg
        text: |-
          Let's put the "fun" back in "FUNction!" 
    loop_while:
      1:
        image: notes/stage9_5.jpg
        text: |-
          Hi, I'm Makinde! Let's learn about the "while block." 
      2:
        image: notes/stage9_6.jpg
        text: 'The "while block" will do whatever you put inside it AS LONG AS the statement on the top is TRUE.'
      3:
        image: notes/stage9_7.jpg
        text: For example, if the farmer is standing on a pile, she will continue to remove 1 shovelful WHILE there is still a pile beneath her.
    loop_for:
      1:
        image: notes/stage11_1.jpg
        text: "Hi, I'm Trina, and I work for Pixar. I've worked on a bunch of movies, including Shrek."
      2:
        image: notes/stage11_2.jpg
        text: 'This is our new "counter" loop. It will perform actions over and over again and you can make the actions change slightly each time.'
      3:
        image: notes/stage11_3.jpg
        text: 'In this example, our "counter" loop says "count with counter from 50 to 90 by 10" and inside it, we have our "draw a square" block. Drag the "counter" block from the "Variables" section into the "length" spot.'
      4:
        image: notes/stage11_4.jpg
        text: "This means our artist is going to draw a square that has 50 pixel length sides, then it will add 10 to that and draw a square with 60 pixel length sides. Then it will keep adding 10 and drawing squares until it reaches 90. So we'll have squares of 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90."
    parameters:

        image: notes/stage15_1.jpg
        text: "Hi, I'm Janete, and I'm an engineer at Zynga."
      2:
        image: notes/stage15_2.jpg
        text: What if we want to draw a bunch of triangles and have their lengths be different sizes?
      3:
        image: notes/stage15_3.jpg
        text: We could write all that code out by hand or we can use a function with parameters.
      4:
        image: notes/stage15_4.jpg
        text: 'To do this, click the blue star on the "draw a triangle" function definition. Then drag "input name" into the "input" block.'
      5:
        image: notes/stage15_5.jpg
        text: |-
          Then if you write "length" in the spot where it says "x" and press "Enter" you'll create a length input for your function.
      6:
        image: notes/stage15_6.jpg
        text: 'Then click on the star. Now, you want to click on the variables category and drag the "length" block into the "move forward" block of your function definition. And drag away the old number block.'
      7:
        image: notes/stage15_7.jpg
        text: 'To use your function with parameters, click on the functions category and drag out your "draw a triangle with length" function.'
      8:
        image: notes/stage15_8.jpg
        text: Now you can use the math block to input different numbers to draw triangles of different sizes.

        image: notes/hoc6_1.jpg
        text: "Congratulations! With the last puzzle you solved, you just wrote code that can tell ANY robot how to find it's way through a non-branching maze or tunnel of any length, whether it's a zombie, a bird, a mars rover, or even a self-driving car."
      2:
        image: notes/hoc6_2.jpg
        text: "The basic concepts you used are at the heart of every program or app you'll ever try.  We learned about repeat loops, repeat until statements, if statements, and if else statements."
      3:
        image: notes/hoc6_3.jpg
        text: "If you liked your first hour of code, visit code.org to continue your education into computer science! Once you complete our 20 hour course, you'll have mastered the basics of programming, and can start learning how to write phone apps, robot instructions, games, you name it."
      4:
