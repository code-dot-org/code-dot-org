# Udhëzues për Orën e Kodimit dhe Javës së Edukimit në Shkencat Kompjuterike

**Afati për te dorëzuar udhëzuesin për Orën e Kodimit 2014 ka kaluar. Gjithsesi, ju ende mund të dorëzoni një të tillë dhe ne do të përpiqemi ta rishikojmë nëqoftëse e lejon koha.**

Code.org do të organizoje aktivitete te ndryshme për Orën e Kodimit në faqen e internetit të Code.org, webfaqet Ora e Kodimit, CSEdWeek. Lista e aktuale ndodhet në: [<%= codeorg_url() %>](http://<%= codeorg_url() %>/learn).

Do të donim të organizonim një sërë aktivitetesh, por qëllimi kryesor është optimalizimi i përvojave të nxënësve dhe mësuesve, të cilët janë të rinj në shkencat kompjuterike. Luteni të përdorni këtë dokument si udhëzues për zhvillimin e aktivitetit tuaj, që i drejtohet përdoruesve të cilët nuk kanë njohuri në kodim, programim kompjuteri apo në shkencat kompjuterike.

## Si vlerësohen tutorialet për përfshirje

Komision në përbërje me instruktor të shkencave kompjuterike do të rangoje materialet bazuar në matrice sasiore dhe cilësore perfshirë dhe rezutate të vlerësimeve nga instruktorë të tjerë.

**Tutorialet do të listohen më lart nëse janë:**

  * të cilësisë së ulët
  * të vetëdrejtuara, që nuk kërkojnë ndonjë udhëzim
  * të dizajnuara për fillestarë
  * të dizajnuara si aktivitet 1~orësh
  * operojnë nëpër shumë OS/pajisje dhe platforma, përfshirë celularët dhe tabletët 
  * funksionojnë në gjuhë të shumta 
  * promovojnë mësimin tek të gjitha grupet demografike (veçanërisht tek grupet e papërfaqsuara)
  * jo vetëm tek HTML+CSS web design - (qëllimi është tek shkencat kompjuterike dhe jo thjesht kodimi HTML)

**Tutorialet do të listohen më poshtë nëse janë:**

  * të cilësisë së ulët
  * të nivelit më të përparuar (jo për fillestar)
  * me numër të kufizuar të platformave OS/pajisjeve - për platformat e bazuara në rrjet duhet të synohet që të kenë IE9+, dhe Chrome, Firefox, e Safari
  * funksionojnë vetëm në Anglisht
  * me prirje specifike gjinore (psh. që tematikisht kanë oreintim tek djemt) 
  * paraqiten si platformë mësimi me pagesë

**Tutorialet që NUK listohen fare nëse:**

  * kërkojnë nivel të lartë të përfshirjes nga mësuesi me përgaditje të shumta (që janë jo të vetë-udhëzuara për nxënesit)
  * nuk janë të dizajnuara për të qenë aktivitet një-orësh
  * kerkojnë sign up 
  * kërkojnë sign up
  * kërkojnë instalim
  * përqëndrohen vetëm në HTML + CSS web design
  * dorëzohen pas afatit të dorëzimit, apo me informacion jo të kompletuar (shih si më poshtë)

Ultimately, the goal of the Hour of Code campaign is to broaden participation in computer science by students and teachers, and to help show that computer science is accessible to all, and “easier than you think.” In many ways, this goal is better achieved by giving students and teachers fewer and simpler choices, with a focus on the highest quality options for a first-time user.

Note also, that the 2013 CSEdWeek was a fantastic success as measured by the responses from teachers and students - 20M participants from Dec 9 - 23, and 97% said they enjoyed it and want to repeat the campaign!!

As a result, the existing listings are certainly “good enough,” and the driving reason to add tutorials to the Hour of Code listings isn’t to broaden the choices, but to raise the quality (or freshness) for students, or to expand the options for non-English speakers given the global nature of the 2014 campaign.

<a id="guidelines"></a>

## Udhëzime të përgjithshme për të krijuar aktivitetin Ora e Kodimit

  * **Subject:** Introductory computer science or programming (not HTML).
  * **Goal:** Give beginners an accessible first taste of programming.
  * **Tone:** 
      * Computer science is not just for geniuses. It doesn’t matter your age, gender, race. Anybody can learn!
      * Computer science is connected to a wide variety of fields and interests. Everybody should learn!
      * Encourage students to create something that can be shared with friends/online.
  * **Types of activities:** 
      * **Best:** Web-based, smartphone-friendly, or unplugged-style activities that teach computer science concepts without the use of a computer (see <http://csunplugged.com/>). 
      * **Okay, but not preferred:** app-install, desktop app, or game-console experiences.
  * **Format:** Self-guided tutorials or lessons, optionally facilitated by the teacher. There should be directions for students as opposed to an open-ended hour long challenge. Ideally, the instructions and tutorials are integrated directly into the programming platform, to avoid switching tabs or windows between the tutorial and the programming platform.

## Sugjerime për të dizajnuar aktivitetin tuaj

**Include the CSEdWeek logo in your tutorial.** You can include the CSEdWeek logo ([small](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ojlltuegr7ruvx1/csedweek-logo-final-small.jpg) or [big](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yolheibpxapzpp1/csedweek-logo-final-big.png)) in your tutorial, but this is not required. You may also contact us to request specific permission to use the “In Partnership with Code.org” logo. ***This logo can only be used if specific permission is granted in writing by Code.org.*** We may end up creating an Hour of Code logo, but at this time we do not have one. Under no circumstances can the Code.org logo and name be used. Both are trademarked, and can’t be co-mingled with a 3rd party brand name.

**Make sure that the average student can finish comfortably in an hour.** Consider adding an open-ended activity at the end for students who move more quickly through the lesson. Remember that most kids will be absolute beginners to computer science and coding.

**Include teacher notes.** Most activities should be student-directed, but if an activity is facilitated or managed by a teacher, please include clear and simple directions for the teacher in the form of teacher-notes at a separate URL submitted with your activity. Not only are the students novices, some of the teachers are as well. Include info such as:

  * Our tutorial works best on the following platforms and browsers
  * Does it work on smartphones? tablets?
  * Do you recommend pair programming? 
  * Considerations for use in a classroom? eg if there are videos, advise teachers to show the videos on a projected screen for the entire classroom to view together

**Incorporate feedback at the end of the activity.** (E.g.: “You finished 10 levels and learned about loops! Great job!”)

**Incorporate social media.** Encourage students to post to social media (where appropriate) when they’ve finished, for example “I’ve done an Hour of Code with ________ Have you? #HourOfCode” or “I’ve done an #HourofCode as a part of #CSEdWeek. Have you? @Scratch.” Use the hashtag **#HourOfCode** (with capital letters H, O, C)

**Create your activity in languages besides English.** We're focusing this campaign internationally this year and would like to have a number of activities to offer non-English speaking participants.

**Explain or connect the activity to a socially significant context.** Computer programming becomes a superpower when students see how it can change the world for the better!

**Do not require signup or payment before students can try your tutorial.** Tutorials that require signup or payment will not be listed

**Make sure your tutorial can be used in a [Pair Programming paradigm](http://www.ncwit.org/resources/pair-programming-box-power-collaborative-learning).**

The three rules of pair programming in a school setting:

  * The driver controls the mouse and keyboard.
  * The Navigator makes suggestions, points out errors, and asks questions. 
  * Students should switch roles at least two times a session.

Benefits of Pair Programming:

  * Students can help one another instead of relying on the teacher
  * Show that coding is not a solo activity, but one involving social interaction
  * Not all classrooms or labs have enough computers for a 1:1 experience

## Udhëzime mbi brand-in 

With ~40 million students having tried the Hour of Code, and over 97% of participating teachers asking us to repeat the event annually, we are taking steps to make sure we set up the Hour of Code as a movement that can repeat annually with greater fidelity and without confusion.

One piece of this is to protect the trademark "Hour of Code" to prevent confusion. Many of our tutorial partners have used "Hour of Code" on your web sites. We don't want to prevent this usage, but we want to make sure it fits within a few limits:

  1. Any reference to "Hour of Code" should be used in a fashion that doesn't suggest that it's your own brand name, but rather referencing the Hour of Code as a grassroots movement. Good example: "Participate in the Hour of Code at ACMECorp.com". Bad example: "Try Hour of Code by ACME Corp"
  2. Use a "TM" superscript in the most prominent places you mention "Hour of Code", both on your web site and in app descriptions
  3. Include language on the page (or in the the footer), including links to the CSEdWeek and Code.org web sites, that says the following:
    
    ***“The 'Hour of Code' is a nationwide initiative by Computer Science Education Week[csedweek.org] and Code.org [code.org] to introduce millions of students to one hour of computer science and computer programming.”***

  4. No use of "Hour of Code" in app names

## Pikselët tregues 

In order to more accurately track participation we ask every third party tutorial partners to include 1-pixel tracking images on the first and last page of their Hour of Code tutorials (A starting pixel-image on the start page and a final pixel-image on the end page. And not on interim pages).

This will allow us to count users who you directly recruit to visit your website to do their Hour of Code, or users who visit when a teacher types your URL directly on their whiteboard. It will lead to more accurate participation counts for your tutorial, which will help you attract users. If you integrate the pixel at the end it will also allow us to measure tutorial completion rates.

If your tutorial is approved and included on the final tutorial page, Code.org will provide you with a unique tracking pixel for you to integrate into your tutorial. See example below.

***NOTE: this isn't important to do for installable apps (iOS/Android apps, or desktop-install apps)***

**Example tracking pixels for AppInventor:**

IMG SRC="http://code.org/api/hour/begin_appinventor.png/"

IMG SRC="http://code.org/api/hour/finish_appinventor.png/"
