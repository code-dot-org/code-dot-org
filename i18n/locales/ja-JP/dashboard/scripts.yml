              description_student: The class learns about collision detection on the computer.  Pairs explore how a computer could use sprite location and size properties and math to detect whether two sprites are touching.  The class then uses the isTouching() block to create different effects when sprites collide, including playing sounds.  Last, they use their new skills to improve the sidescroller game that they started in the last lesson.

              description_student: 'The class learns to combine the velocity properties of sprites with the counter pattern to create more complex sprite movement, such as simulating gravity, making a sprite jump, and allowing a sprite to float left or right. In the final levels the class combine these movements to animate and control a single sprite and build a simple game in which a character flies around and collects coins. '
              description_teacher: Students learn to combine the velocity properties of sprites with the counter pattern to create more complex sprite movement. In particular students will learn how to simulate gravity, make a sprite jump, and allow a sprite to float left or right. In the final levels of the Code Studio progression students combine these movements to animate and control a single sprite and build a simple game in which a character flies around and collects a coin. Students are encouraged to make their own additions to the game in the final level.
            Collisions:
              name: 碰撞
              description_student: The class programs their sprites to interact in new ways.  After a brief review of how they used the isTouching block, the class brainstorms other ways that two sprites could interact.  They then use isTouching to make one sprite push another across the screen before practicing with the four collision blocks (collide, displace, bounce, and bounceOff).
              description_teacher: Students program their sprites to interact in new ways.  After a brief review of how they used the `isTouching` block, students brainstorm other ways that two sprites could interact.

            Functions:
              name: 函式
              description_student: This lesson covers functions as a way to organize their code, make it more readable, and remove repeated blocks of code. The class learns that higher level or more abstract steps make it easier to understand and reason about steps, then begins to create functions in Game Lab.  At the end of the lesson the class uses these skills to organize and add functionality to the final version of their side scroller game.
              description_teacher: Students learn how to create functions to organize their code, make it more readable, and remove repeated blocks of code. An unplugged warmup explores how directions at different levels of detail can be useful depending on context. Students learn that higher level or more abstract steps make it easier to understand and reason about steps. Afterwards students learn to create functions in Game Lab. They will use functions to remove long blocks of code from their draw loop and to replace repeated pieces of code with a single function. At the end of the lesson students use these skills to organize and add functionality to the final version of their side scroller game.
            The Game Design Process:
              name: The Game Design Process
              description_student: This lesson introduces the process the class will use to design games for the remainder of the unit. The class walks through through this process in a series of levels. As part of this lesson the class also briefly learn to use multi-frame animations in Game Lab. At the end of the lesson they have an opportunity to make improvements to the game to make it their own.
              description_teacher: This lesson introduces students to the process they will use to design games for the remainder of the unit. This process is centered around a project guide which asks students to define their sprites, variables, and functions before they begin programming their game. In this lesson students begin by playing a game on Game Lab where the code is hidden. They discuss what they think the sprites, variables, and functions would need to be to make the game. They are then given a completed project guide which shows one way to implement the game. Students are then walked through this process through a series of levels. As part of this lesson students also briefly learn to use multi-frame animations in Game Lab. At the end of the lesson students have an opportunity to make improvements to the game to make it their own.
            Using the Game Design Process:
              name: 使用遊戲設計流程
              description_student: In this multi-day lesson, the class uses the problem solving process from Unit 1 to create a platform jumper game.  After looking at a sample game, the class defines what their games will look like and uses a structured process to build them.  Finally, the class reflects on how the games could be improved, and implements those changes.
              description_teacher: In this multi-day lesson, students use the problem solving process from Unit 1 to create a platform jumper game.  They start by looking at an example of a platform jumper, then define what their games will look like.  Next, they use a structured process to plan the backgrounds, variables, sprites, and functions they will need to implement their game.  After writing the code for the game, students will reflect on how the game could be improved, and implement those changes.

            Plotting Shapes:
              name: 幾何繪圖
              description_student: Students explore the challenges of communicating how to draw with shapes and use a tool that introduces how this problem is approached in Game Lab. The warm up activity quickly demonstrates the challenges of communicating position without some shared reference point. In the main activity students explore a Game Lab tool that allows students to interactively place shapes on Game Lab's 400 by 400 grid. They then take turns instructing a partner how to draw a hidden image using this tool, accounting for many challenges students will encounter when programming in Game Lab. Students optionally create their own image to communicate before a debrief discussion.

            Shapes and Randomness:
              name: 形狀與隨機性
              description_student: This lesson extends the drawing skills to include width and height and introduces the concept of random number generation. The class learns to draw with versions of ellipse() and rect() that include width and height parameters and to use the background() block to fill the screen with color. At the end of the progression the class is introduced to the randomNumber() block and uses the new blocks to draw a randomized rainbow snake.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students continue to develop their drawing skills. At the beginning of the lesson a teacher-led discussion connects expanded block functionality (e.g. different sized shapes) with the need for more block inputs, or "parameters". Students learn to draw with versions of `ellipse()` and `rect()` that include width and height parameters. They also learn to use the `background()` block. At the end of the progression students are introduced to the `randomNumber()` block. Combining all of these skills students will draw a randomized rainbow snake at the end of the lesson.
            Variables:
              name: 變數
              description_student: This lesson introduces variables as a way to label a number in a program or save a randomly generated value. The class begins the lesson with a very basic description of the purpose of a variable and practices using the new blocks.  Afterwards, the class uses variables to save a random number, allowing the programs to use the same random number multiple times.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students learn how to use variables to label a number in their program or save a randomly generated value. Students begin the lesson with a very basic description of the purpose of a variable. Students then complete a level progression that reinforces the model of a variable as a way to label or name a number. Students use variables to save a random number to see that variables actually store or save their values, allowing them to use the same random number multiple times in their programs.
            Sprites:
              name: 角色
              description_student: In order to create more interesting and detailed images, the class is introduced to the sprite object. Every sprite can be assigned an image to show, and sprites also keep track of multiple values about themselves, which will prove useful down the road when making animations.  At the end of the lesson, everyone creates a scene using sprites.

            The Draw Loop:
              name: The Draw Loop
              description_student: This lesson introduces the draw loop, one of the core programming paradigms in Game Lab.  The class combines the draw loop with random numbers to manipulate some simple animations with dots and then with sprites. Afterwards, everyone uses what they learned to update the sprite scene from the previous lesson.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students are introduced to the draw loop, one of the core programming paradigms in Game Lab. To begin the lesson students look at some physical flipbooks to see that having many frames with different images creates the impression of motion. Students then watch a video explaining how the draw loop in Game Lab helps to create this same impression in their programs. Students combine the draw loop with random numbers to manipulate some simple animations with dots and then with sprites. At the end of the lesson students use what they learned to update their sprite scene from the previous lesson.
            The Counter Pattern Unplugged:
              name: The Counter Pattern Unplugged
              description_student: This unplugged lesson explores the underlying behavior of variables. Using notecards and string to simulate variables within a program, the class implements a few short programs. Once comfortable with this syntax, the class uses the same process with sprite properties, tracking a sprite's progress across the screen.

            Conditionals:
              name: 條件判斷（Conditionals）
              description_student: The class starts by using booleans to compare the current value of a sprite property with a target value, using that comparison to determine when a sprite has reached a point on the screen, grown to a given size, or otherwise reached a value using the counter pattern. After using booleans directly to investigate the values or sprite properties, the class adds conditional if statements to write code that responds to those boolean comparisons.

            Keyboard Input:
              name: Keyboard Input
              description_student: Following the introduction to booleans and if statements in the previous lesson, students are introduced to a new block called keyDown() which returns a boolean and can be used in conditionals statements to move sprites around the screen. By the end of this lesson students will have written programs that take keyboard input from the user to control sprites on the screen.

            Other Forms of Input:
              name: Other Forms of Input
              description_student: The class continues to explore ways to use conditional statements to take user input. In addition to the simple keyDown() command learned yesterday, the class learns about several other keyboard input commands as well as ways to take mouse input.

            Booleans Unplugged:
              name: Booleans Unplugged
              description_student: This lesson introduces boolean values and logic, as well as conditional statements. The class starts by playing a simple game of Stand Up, Sit Down in which the boolean (true/false) statements describe personal properties (hair or eye color, clothing type, age, etc). The class then groups objects based on increasingly complex boolean statements, then looks at how conditionals can impact the flow of a program.
              description_teacher: |-
                In this lesson, students are introduced to boolean values and logic, as well as conditional statements. The class starts by playing a simple game of Stand Up, Sit Down in which the boolean (true/false) statements describe personal properties (hair or eye color, clothing type, age, etc). This gets students thinking about how they can frame a property with multiple potential values (such as age) with a binary question.
                
                From there students are provided a group of objects with similar, yet varying, physical properties. With a partner they group those objects based on increasingly complex boolean statements, including compound booleans with AND and OR.
                
                Finally we reveal Conditionals as a tool to make decisions or impact the flow of a program using boolean statements as input.

              description_student: The class plans and builds original games using the project guide from the previous two lessons. Working individually or in pairs, the class plans, develops, and gives feedback on the games.  After incorporating the peer feedback, the class shares out the completed games.
              description_teacher: Students will plan and build their own game using the project guide from the previous two lessons to guide their project. Working individually or in pairs, students will first decide on the type of game they'd like to build, taking as inspiration a set of sample games. They will then complete a blank project guide where they will describe the game's behavior and scope out the variables, sprites, and functions they'll need to build. In Code Studio, a series of levels prompts them on a general sequence they can use to implement this plan. Partway through the process, students will share their projects for peer review and will incorporate feedback as they finish their game. At the end of the lesson, students will share their completed games with their classmates. This project will span multiple classes and can easily take anywhere from 3-5 class periods.

            The Problem Solving Process:
              name: The Problem Solving Process
              description_student: This lesson introduces the formal problem solving process that the class will use over the course of the year, Define - Prepare - Try - Reflect.  The class relates these steps to the aluminum boats problem from the previous lesson, then a problem they are good at solving, then a problem they want to improve at solving. At the end of the lesson the class collects a list of generally useful strategies for each step of the process to put on posters that will be used throughout the unit and year.
              description_teacher: This lesson introduces the formal problem solving process that students will use over the course of the year, Define - Prepare - Try - Reflect. The lesson begins by asking students to brainstorm all the different types of problems that they encounter in everyday life. Students are then shown the four steps of the problem solving process and work together to relate these abstract steps to their actual experiences solving problems. First students relate these steps to the aluminum boats problem from the previous lesson, then a problem they are good at solving, then a problem they want to improve at solving. At the end of the lesson the class collects a list of generally useful strategies for each step of the process to put on posters that will be used throughout the unit and year.

              description_teacher: |-
                In this lesson students apply the problem solving process to three different problems in order to better understand the value of each step. They will solve a word search, arrange seating for a birthday party, and plan a trip. The problems grow increasingly complex and poorly defined to highlight how the problem solving process is particularly helpful when tackling these types of problems. The lesson concludes with students reflecting on their experience with the problem solving process. They will justify the inclusion of each step and will brainstorm questions or strategies that can help them better define open-ended problems, as this is often the most critical step.
                
                This lesson will likely take two class periods or more to complete. The first two problems may fit into a single class period but the third will need to be moved to a second day.

After brainstorming the possible definitions for a computer, the class works in groups to sort pictures into “is a computer” or “is not a computer” on poster paper and explain their motivations for choosing some of the most difficult categorizations.  The teacher then introduces a definition of the computer and allows groups to revise their posters according to the new definition.

                In this lesson students develop a preliminary definition of a computer. To begin the lesson, the class will brainstorm possible definitions for a computer and place the results of this brainstorm on the board. Next, students will work in groups to sort pictures into “is a computer” or “is not a computer” on poster paper. Groups will place their posters around the room and briefly explain their motivations for choosing some of their most difficult categorizations.  The teacher will then introduce a definition of the computer and allow students to revise their posters according to the new definition.

To conclude the lesson the class examines common activities they do on a computing device and select the inputs and outputs used for that activity from the chart.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students consider a number of computing devices to determine what types of inputs and outputs they use. Groups are assigned to a computing device and based on a teacher-provided definition of input and output, list the inputs and outputs of their device. Earlier in the activity students are prompted to focus on more obvious physical inputs and outputs (e.g. a keyboard as an input or a screen as an output) but later discussions lead students to consider less obvious examples (e.g. that a touch screen is both an input and output, or the fact that the Internet can serve as both input and output). Throughout the lesson the teacher records inputs and outputs that are identified on a T-Chart at the front of the room. To conclude the lesson students examine common activities they do on a computing device and select the inputs and outputs used for that activity from the chart.
            Processing:
              name: Processing
              description_student: This lesson dives deeper into the concept of processing that was introduced as part of the definition of a computer.  Pairs work together to puta deck of cards in order, a form of processing information.  In the end, the class discusses what processing means within the context of solving information problems.
              description_teacher: Students complete two unplugged card sorting activities to explore the meaning of processing and its relationship to problem-solving. The first has few constraints and is used to introduce a high-level definition of processing. The next introduces more constraints that forces students to develop an algorithm that will always successfully process the cards. Students iteratively develop, test, and share their algorithms with classmates. A wrap-up discussion has students reflect on the different types of problem-solving they used in these activities and the value of producing an algorithm to solve a problem.
            Storage:
              name: Storage
              description_student: This lesson focuses on the storage component of the definition of a computer, within the content of processing information. The class spends the majority of the lesson developing and sharing algorithms to process information, with an emphasis on how much storage is needed for any particular algorithm. The lesson concludes with a discussion of the importance of storage while processing information.
              description_teacher: Students explore the importance of storage within the Input-Storage-Processing-Output model of a computer. The warm-up activity asks students to reflect on the types of information they have seen computers store in the past, like documents, photographs, or videos. The unplugged main activity has students develop an algorithm to process a small pile of cards in search of specific cards within the deck. Constraints on how students can move the cards force them to consider the importance of storage even while they are processing the deck. The lesson concludes with a discussion of the two types of storage students saw in this lesson and the importance of storage while processing information.
            Apps and Problem Solving:
              name: Apps and Problem Solving

              description_student: This lesson takes a step back from creating the personal website to talk about personal information people choose to share digitally.  The class begins by discussing what types of information are good to share with other people, then looks at several sample social media pages to see what types of personal information could be shared intentionally or unintentionally.  Finally, the class comes up with a set of guidelines to follow when putting information online.
              description_teacher: "As students have recently spent some time thinking about the actual content that will go into their personal website, this lesson takes a step back from the unit-long project (publication of a personal website) to help students articulate what personal information they choose to share digitally and with whom.  It also reinforces the notion that much of the information that they choose to share digitally falls largely out of their control the moment it is released.  \\r\n\\r\nStudents begin by individually identifying appropriate audiences with whom they would be comfortable sharing given pieces of personal information.  They then look at several social media pages to determine what sorts of information people are sharing about themselves or one another.  Last, students reflect on what guidelines they think are appropriate for posting information online.\\r\n\\r\nThe ultimate point of this lesson is not to scare students, but rather to experientially bring students to realizing precisely what level of control they don’t have in releasing information into the web."

          description_audience: ''
          description_short: "  Learn how to design a program that meets the needs of your users."
          description: Unit 4 introduces the broader social impacts of computing. Through a series of design challenges, you will learn how to better understand the needs of others while developing a solution to a problem. The second half of the unit consists of an iterative team project, during which teams have the opportunity to identify a need that they care about, prototype solutions both on paper and in App Lab, and test solutions with real users to get feedback and drive further iteration.
          stages:
            Analysis of Design:
              name: 設計分析
              description_student: The class explores a variety of different teapot designs to consider how design choices or made and why. Using the teapots as an example, the class will explore the relationship between users, their needs, and the design of objects they use.
              description_teacher: To kick off a unit devoted to group problem solving and developing products for other users, students begin by investigating the design of various teapots. Students analyze each teapot, attempting to identify how specific user needs might have informed its design. By considering these design choices, and attempting to match each teapot with a potential user, students can begin to see how taking a user-centered approach to designing products (both physical and digital) can make those products more useful and usable. To conclude the activity, students are asked to propose some changes to one of the teapots that would make it more useful or usable.
            Understanding Your User:
              name: 瞭解您的使用者
              description_student: Using user profiles, the class explores how different users might react to a variety of products. Role playing as a different person, each member of the class will get to experience designs through someone else's eyes.
              description_teacher: |
                Designers need to understand their users’ needs in order to create useful products.  This lesson encourages students to think about how to design for another person by role-playing as someone else using a user profile and reacting as that user to a series of products.  Each student is assigned a user profile describing a person, which they then use to choose appropriate products, critique product design, and suggest improvements to design.
            Discovering Users:
              name: 發現用戶
            User-Centered Design Micro Activity:
              name: User-Centered Design Micro Activity
              description_student: In small groups, the class uses the design process to come up with ideas for smart clothing. From brainstorming, to identifying users, to finally proposing a design, this is the first of several opportunities in this unit to practicing designing a solution for the needs of others.
              description_teacher: This lesson guides students through an abbreviated version of the design process they will be seeing throughout this unit. Students first brainstorm a list of potential users of smart clothing. As a class, they then group these ideas into broad categories and each group will choose one category of user. Groups repeat this process to brainstorm needs or concerns of their user, eventually categorizing these needs and choosing one to focus on. Finally, students design a piece of smart clothing, using the specific needs and concerns they brainstormed to guide their decision making. At the end of the class students quickly share their decision-making process and get feedback on how well their product addresses the user need they selected.

            Designing Apps for Good:
              name: 設計良好的應用程式
              description_student: To kick off the app design project, the class organizes into teams and starts exploring app topics. Several example socially impactful apps serve as inspiration for the project.
              description_teacher: To kick off the app design project that lasts through the end of the unit, students first explore a number of apps designed for social impact that have been created by other students. The class then reviews the Define, Prepare, Try, and Reflect steps of the Problem Solving process as they develop an idea for an app of their own with social impact. Finally, students will form project teams and lay out a contract for how the team will function throughout the development of their app.
            Market Research:
              name: 市場研究
              description_student: Dive into app development by exploring existing apps that may serve similar users. Each group identifies a handful of apps that address the same topic they are working on, using those apps to help refine the app idea they will pursue.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students research apps similar to the one they intend on creating to better understand the needs of their users. Students work within their teams to search the Internet for other apps, then evaluate the ones they find interesting. By the end of the lesson, each team will have a clearer idea about the type of app they want to create and further refine who their target users are. Each team will maintain a list of citations for all the apps they examined for use in their final presentation.
            Paper Prototypes:
              name: 紙上原型
              description_student: Paper prototypes allow developers to quickly test ideas before investing a lot of time writing code. In this lesson teams explore some example apps created in App Lab, using those apps to help inform the first paper prototypes of their apps.
              description_teacher: |
                Before starting to design apps, we need to help students to better scope their expectations. Because students will eventually be prototyping these apps in App Lab, they will be in better shape if their ideas align with the kinds of apps that are easily prototyped in App Lab. Teams start this scoping by looking through several example apps designed to demonstrate apps that can be created with App Lab. Teams then can chose one (or more) of the apps as a basis for their own. From there, teams have some time to discuss the basic functionality of their app before using 3x5 index cards to develop paper prototypes.
            Prototype Testing:
              name: 原型測試
              description_student: In this lesson teams test out their paper prototypes with other members of the class. With one student role playing the computer, one narrating, and the rest observing, teams will get immediate feedback on their app designs which will inform the next version of their app prototypes.
              description_teacher: The primary purpose of developing paper prototypes is that they allow for quick testing and iteration before any code is written. This lesson is focused on giving teams a chance to test their prototypes before moving to App Lab. Teams develop a plan to test with users before running prototype tests with multiple other students in the class (and potentially outside the class). In order to test the prototype with the users, the students will have to assign roles in the testing (the “narrator”, the “computer” and the “observers”) as well as have some questions prepared for the user to answer after the test is complete.
            Digital Design:
              name: 數位設計
              description_student: Having developed, tested, and gathered feedback on a paper prototype, teams now moves to App Lab to build the next iteration of their apps. Using the drag-and-drop Design Mode, each team member builds out at least one page of their team's app, responding to feedback that was received in the previous round of testing.
              description_teacher: Having collaboratively developed a paper prototype for their apps, groups now divide and conquer to begin implementing an interactive digital version of their prototype. Using the drag-and-drop design mode of App Lab, students individually work through a progression of skill-building levels to learn how to build digital app wireframes. From there, each group member builds out at least one page of their app in App Lab.
            Event Driven Programming:
              name: Event Driven Programming
              description_student: Building on the screens that the class designed in the previous lesson, teams combine screens into a single app. Simple code can then be added to make button clicks change to the appropriate screen.
              description_teacher: In this lesson teams combine the screens that they designed in the previous lesson into a single app, which they then begin to program using simple events. Students learn basic event driven programming by making several small apps that respond to users clicking buttons. Following that, group members share the screens they've developed and each group member imports all of the screens into their own copy of the app, which they will make interactive by connecting buttons to events.
            Basic App Functionality:
              name: 基本的 App 函式
              description_student: Teams add a bit more polish and functionality to their apps before testing. Several examples are provided to demonstrate simple code that adds cool features.
              description_teacher: At this point in the development process, each student should have what is essentially a digital version of the paper prototype - static screens that are linked together with buttons. For many apps this is all you really need to start testing with users, but this lesson will give students a chance to explore simple ways to add a bit more functionality to their apps before moving into the testing phase. The programming concepts introduced in this lesson are **not necessary** to successfully complete the project, and can be omitted at your discretion.
            Testing the App:
              name: 測試應用程式
              description_student: Teams run another round of user testing, this time with their interactive prototype. Feedback gathered from this round of testing will inform the final iteration of the app prototypes.
              description_teacher: 'By the end of the previous lesson each team should have a minimum viable prototype of their app. The primary purpose of this lesson is to have the team actually test the app with other people, preferably from the target audience the app is intended for, or from different teams in the class while observers from the team will record the results on the worksheets they used in the planning phase. As with testing the paper prototypes, teams will start by planning for the specific scenarios before running and observing tests. '
            Improving and Iterating:
              name: Improving and Iterating
              description_student: Using the feedback from the last round of testing, teams implement changes that address the needs of their users. Each team tracks and prioritizes the features they want to add and the bugs they need to fix.
              description_teacher: Teams have at this point developed an app prototype that has gone through multiple iterations and rounds of user testing. With the information and guidance gained from the last round of user testing, each student has the opportunity to plan for and implement improvements to the team app. Depending on the time you have available, and student interest, you can run the cycle of testing and iteration as many times as you see fit.
            App Presentation:
              name: App Presentation
              description_student: Each team prepares a presentation to "pitch" the app they've developed. This is the time to share struggles, triumphs, and plans for the future.
              description_teacher: At this point teams have researched a topic of personal and social importance, developed and tested both a paper prototype and a digital prototype, and iterated on the initial app to incorporate new features and bug fixes. Now is the time for them to review what they have done and pull together a coherent presentation to demonstrate their process of creation. Using the provided presentation template, teams prepare to present about their process of app development, including the problem they set out to solve, the ways in which they've incorporated feedback from testing, and their plans for the future.
            User Interface and Prototype Testing:
              name: User Interface and Prototype Testing
              description_student: See how a paper prototype can be used to test and get feedback on software before writing any code. To help out a developer with their idea, the class tests and provides an app prototype made of paper.
              description_teacher: Following the mini design project, students look towards the next phase of design - prototyping a product that attempts to address user needs. In teams, students examine a paper prototype for a chat app called "Txt Ur Grndkdz". Through using this paper prototype, students get a chance to see how a simple paper prototype can be used to quickly test ideas and assumptions before we ever get to the computer. After "using" the provided prototype students begin to identify ways to improve the next iteration.
            Feedback and Prototypes:
              name: Feedback and Prototypes
              description_student: Users have been testing an app, and they have lots of feedback for the developer. The class needs to sort through all of this feedback, identify the common themes and needs, and start revising the prototype to make it better meet the users' needs.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students use feedback from "users" of the paper-prototyped app from the previous lesson in order to develop improvements to the user interface of that paper prototype. The lesson begins with a reflection on the fact that designers need to translate human needs with technology into changes to the user interface or experience. Students are then given a collection of feedback and requests from users of the app from the previous lesson. In groups students categorize the feedback and identify ways the needs expressed in the feedback could be met by changes to the interface of the app. Then in groups students will implement some of these changes to meet one of the needs they identified.
            Identifying User Needs:
              name: 確定使用者需求
              description_student: Up to this point the users that the class has considered have all been remote, and the only information from users has come through text or role playing. Now the class will rely on each other as potential users, and pairs will get to interview each other to identify needs that could be addressed by developing an app.
              description_teacher: 'Up to this point students have focused on designing for users who are, to some degree, distanced from them. Whether through brainstorming, profiles, or text feedback, the connection to an end user has never been direct. This is distance is designed to help students get outside their own head when thinking about users, but in order to get information more directly from an actual user, students need to rely on their classmates. In this lesson students pair up to become users (and designers) for each other, allowing everyone to directly interview their end user and ask questions to better inform their design. Each student pair interviews each other, attempting to identify a specific need that could be addressed by an app. '
            Project - Paper Prototype:
              name: 專案 - 紙上原型
              description_student: Using the interview information from the previous lesson, the class comes up with app ideas to address the needs of their users. To express those ideas, and test out their effectiveness, each student creates and tests paper prototypes of their own.
              description_teacher: Based on the peer interview from the previous lesson, each student comes up with an idea for an app that will address their user's problem. Students then get to create their own paper prototype of their app ideas by drawing "screens" on individual notecards. A project guide directs students through the process including building the app and testing it with their user to see if their assumptions about the user interfaces they created are accurate.

This lesson will expose students to wider variety of computing form factors (what a computer looks like) and fields that are impacted by computing. Later in this unit students will look back on the devices they encountered in this lesson as they develop their own physical computing devices.
            Input Unplugged:
              name: 不插電介紹輸入（Input）
              description_student: Experience two different ways that an app can take input from a user, while learning more about the event-driven programming model used in App Lab.
              description_teacher: In preparation for delving deeper into programming with App Lab, students will explore how a handful of different programs written in both Game Lab and App Lab handle taking input from the user. After comparing and contrasting the approaches they saw in the example apps, students group up to act out the two different models for input (conditionals in an infinite and asynchronous events) to gain a better understanding of how they work.
            Event Types:
              name: Event Types
              description_student: Review the basics of programming in App Lab and explore some new event types that can be used in your programs.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students review the material they learned about creating apps in App Lab from Unit 4 in order to prepare for a return to App Lab in this unit. This review should be modified to best meet the needs of your students and their experience and familiarity with programming in App Lab. In addition to the review the students will also experiment with a variety of new event types that they likely have not seen before.
            Getters and Setters:
              name: Getters and Setters
              description_student: By reading and changing the content on the screen of an app, the class starts to build apps that only need a single screen. Even with just one screen, these techniques allow for lots of user interaction and functionality.
              description_teacher: In Unit 4 students learned a very simple approach to app development in App Lab that required a separate screen for most interactions. To expand the kinds of apps that students can make, and to encourage them to think in new ways about how users interact with apps, we introduce the concept of "getters" and "setters". These are commands which can get and set (or change) the content and properties of various design elements. In this lesson students build up simple apps that only require a single screen, the content of which is changed using getters and setters.
            The Circuit Playground:
              name: 電路（Circuit ）遊樂場
              description_student: Get to know the Circuit Playground, the circuit board that will be used throughout the rest of this unit. Using App Lab, develop programs that use the Circuit Playground for output.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students get their first opportunity to write programs that use the Circuit Playground. After first inspecting the board visually and hypothesizing possibly functionalities, students move online where they will learn to write applications that blink an LED and make noise with a buzzer. By combining App Lab screens with the Circuit Playgrounds, students can gradually start to integrate elements of the board as an ouput device while relying on App Lab for user input.
            Lists:
              name: 清單
              description_student: Learn how lists can be used to store multiple values in a single variable name.
              description_teacher: A list, also commonly known as an array, is a type of variable that can store many values at once. In this lesson, students learn to create lists which store a series of related values in a single variable. After creating lists of their own, students will learn about ways to extract either a specific or random value from a list using its index.
            Lights:
              name: 燈光
              description_student: Using the concept of lists from the previous lesson, the class writes programs that control the ten color LEDs on the Circuit Playground.
              description_teacher: The Circuit Playground includes 10 color LEDs in a ring around the outside edge. These LEDs are accessible in code as a list called `colorLeds`. Building on the understanding of lists from the previous lesson, students write programs that control the color LEDs by accessing them from a list.
            For Loops:
              name: 計數迴圈（For Loops）
              description_student: The class learns about repeating instructions using a _for loop_, first by controlling a "robot" through a grid, and then in App Lab.
              description_teacher: Students are introduced to the _for loop_ in this lesson as a way to repeat some code a certain numbers of times. Students start with an unplugged activity where they use for loops to navigate a robot across a grid. Once complete, students then take their knowledge into App Lab where they write programs that rely on iteration using a _for loop_.
            Lists and For Loops:
              name: 清單和計數迴圈
              description_student: Combining _lists_ and _for loops_ allows you to write code that impacts every element of a list, regardless of how long it is. The class uses this structure to write programs that process all of the elements in lists, include the list of color LEDs.
              description_teacher: 'Using a _for loop_ to iterate over all of the elements in an array is a really useful construct in most programming languages. In this lesson, students combine what they have learned about lists and for loops in order to start learning this pattern. Students use for loops to go through each element in a list one at a time without having to write code for each element. Towards the end of the lesson students will apply this with the `colorLed` list on the board. '
            Timed Loops:
              name: 計時迴圈
              description_student: In this lesson we build on students understanding of for loops to learn about a more sophisticated structure called a timed loop. Unlike for loops, you can control how quickly a timed loop repeats, and other code (such as event handlers) can be run between iterations of the loop. This allows us to create interesting animations that repeat infinitely, while still allowing other code to run alongside it.

            'Project: Board Output':
              name: 'Project: Board Output'
              description_student: Students take what they've learned through chapter one, and develop an app of their own design that uses the board to output information.
              description_teacher: Students take what they've learned through chapter one, and develop an app of their own design that uses the board to output information.
            Physical Input:
              name: Physical Input
              description_student: Using the hardware buttons and switch, the class develops programs that use the Circuit Playground as an input.
              description_teacher: This lesson transitions students from consider the Circuit Playground as strictly an output device towards using it as a tool for both input and output. Starting with the hardware buttons and switch,sing the hardware buttons and switch, students learn to use `onBoardEvent()`, analogously to `onEvent()`, in order to take input from their Circuit Playgrounds.
            Analog Input:
              name: 模擬輸入
              description_student: Explore the analog inputs on the Circuit Playground, writing programs that respond to the environment through sensors.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students explore how the three analog sensors (sound, light, and temperature) can be used to write programs that respond to changes in the environment. The use of these sensors marks a transition in terms of how users interact with a program. By using sensors as an input, the user of an app doesn't have to directly interact with it at all, or may interact without actually realizing they are doing so.
            Sensor Applications:
              name: 傳感器應用
              description_student: Work through three small apps to better understand the uses of the sensors from the previous lesson.
              description_teacher: To follow up on the sensors that students learned about in the previous lesson, we walk through a three apps, each of which relies on a different sensor. These three apps can serve as jumping off points for students in the final project that follows.
            'Project: Prototype an Innovation':
              name: 專案：原型創新
              description_student: Develop innovative computing devices of your own design, using everything you've learned throughout this course.
              description_teacher: 'In this final project for the course, student team to develop and test a prototype for an innovative computing device based on the Circuit Playground. Using the inputs and outputs available on the board, groups will create programs that allow for interesting and unique user interactions. '

          description_audience: ''
          description_short: Learn how people use computers to solve data problems.
          description: Unit 5 is about the importance of data in solving problems and highlights how computers can help in this process. The first chapter explores different systems used to represent information in a computer and the challenges and tradeoffs posed by using them. In the second chapter you’ll learn how collections of data are used to solve problems, and how computers help to automate the steps of this process. The chapter concludes by considering how the data problem solving process can be applied to an area of the your choosing.
          stages:
            Representation Matters:
              name: 表示事項
              description_student: In the first lesson of the data unit, students will get an overview of what data is and how it is used to solve problems.  Students will start off with a brief discussion to come to a common understanding of data.  They then split into groups and use a data set to make a series of meal recommendations for people with various criteria.  Each group has the choices of meal represented in a different way (pictures, recipes, menu, nutrition) that gives an advantage for one of the recommendations.  Afterwards, groups compare their responses and discuss how the different representations of the meal data affected how the students were able to solve the different problems.

            Patterns and Representation:
              name: 模式和標記法
              description_student: In this lesson students create their own system for representing information. They begin by brainstorming all the different systems they already use to represent yes-no responses. They then work in small groups to create a system that can represent any letter in the alphabet using only a single stack of cards. The cards used have one of 6 different possible drawings (6 animals, 6 colors, etc.) and so to represent the entire alphabet students will need to use patterns of multiple cards to represent each letter. Students will create messages with their systems and exchange with other groups to ensure the system worked as intended. In the wrap-up discussion the class will review any pros and cons of the different systems. They will discuss commonalities between working systems and recognize that there are many possible solutions to this problem and what's important is that everyone use the same arbitrary system to communicate.

            ASCII and Binary Representation:
              name: ASCII 和 二進位表示法
              description_student: In this lesson students learn to use their first binary system for encoding information, the ASCII system for representing letters and other characters. At the beginning of the lesson the teacher introduces the fact that computers must represent information using either "on" or "off". Then students are introduced to the ASCII system for representing text using binary symbols. Students practice using this system before encoding their own message using ASCII. At the end of the lesson a debrief conversation helps synthesize the key learning objectives of the activity.

            Representing Images:
              name: 表示圖像
              description_student: In this lesson students learn how computers represent images. To begin the lesson they consider the challenge of turning all the complexity of vision into a binary pattern. Through a series of images showing how this transformation is made students are introduced to the concept of splitting images into squares or "pixels" which can then be turned on or off individually to make the entire image. Students then do a short set of challenges using the Pixelation Widget in order to draw black and white images. Puzzles are designed to call out some of the challenges of representing images in this way. In the wrap up students make connections between the system for representing images and the system for representing text they learned in the previous lesson.

            Combining Representations:
              name: 組合表示
              description_student: In this lesson, students use all three types of binary representation systems (ASCII characters, binary number, and images) to decode information in a record.  After seeing a series of bits and being asked to decode them, students are introduced to the idea that in order to understand binary information, they must understand both the system that is being used and the meaning of the information encoded.  They then decode a record representing a pet based on a given structure.

              description_student: In this lesson students design a structure to represent their perfect day using the binary representation systems they've learned in this chapter. Students will first write a short description of their perfect day and then review with a partner to identify the key pieces of information they think a computer could capture. As a class students will decide how a punch card of bytes of information will be interpreted to represent those pieces of information. Students will then use the ASCII, binary number, and image formats they have learned to represent their perfect days. Students then trade punch cards and try to decipher what the other student's perfect day is like. The lesson ends with a reflection.

              description_student: In this lesson students get practice making decisions with data based on some problems designed to be familiar to middle school students. Students work in groups discussing how they would use the data presented to make a decision before the class discusses their final choices. Not all questions have right answers and in some cases students can and should decide that they should collect more data. The lesson concludes with a discussion of how different people could draw different conclusions from the same data, or how collecting different data might have affected the decisions they made.

              name: 解譯數據
              description_student: In this lesson, students go further into the interpretation of data, including cleaning and visualizing raw data sets.  Students first look at the how presenting data in different ways can help people to understand it better.  They then visualize their own raw data set, in the context of a pizza topping survey, deciding what to do with data that does not easily fit into the visualization scheme that they have chosen.  Last, students look at what parts of this process can be automated, and what need a human to make decisions.

              name: 自動化數據決策
              description_student: In this lesson students look at a simple example of how a computer could be used to complete essentially every step of the data problem solving process. To begin students are given the clean data they collected about their ice cream preferences. They use a spreadsheet to visualize this data using simple charts and discuss in groups the decision they would make with this data. Students then create rules, or an algorithm, that a computer could use to make this decision automatically. Groups share their rules and what choices their rules would make with the class data. They then use their rules on data from another class to reinforce the fact that the rules they create should be useful for any data set. The lesson concludes with a discussion about the benefits and drawbacks of using computers to automate the data problem solving process.

              name: 用大數據解決問題
              description_student: In this lesson, students look at how data is collected and used by a organizations to solve problems in the real world. The lesson begins with a quick review of the data problem solving process they have explored in this unit. Then students are presented three scenarios that could be solved using data and they brainstorm the types of data they would want to solve them and how they could collect the data. Each problem is designed to reflect a real-world service that exists. After brainstorming students will watch a video about a real-world service and will record notes about what data is collected by the real-world service and how it is used. At the end of the lesson students record whether data was provided actively by a user, was recorded passively, or is collected by sensors.

              description_student: To conclude this unit students will design a way to use data to make a recommendation or prediction to help solve a problem. Students will follow a project guide to complete this multi-day activity. In the first several steps students brainstorm problems, perform simple research, and define a problem of their choosing. They will then decide what kind of data they would want to collect, how it could be collected, and how it could be used. Students will perform a peer review and make any necessary updates to their project before preparing a presentation to their classmates.

Eventually, student extend the pattern to a generic 4-bit system.
            8-bit Numbers:
              name: 8 位元數字
              description_student: Students review the concept of binary numbers, and discuss that they need to know the bit-length of each number in order to decode a series of bits.  They then made a flippy-do, a paper manipulative that will help them to encode and decode 8-bit numbers (0-255).  After practicing with the flippy-do, students discuss how they could extend that standardization to the other types of data.
