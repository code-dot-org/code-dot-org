## 米国以外の学校はビデオチャット賞をもらうことができますか？

## なぜ1万ドルのハードウェア賞は公立学校だけが対象なのですか？

We would love to help teachers in public and private schools alike, but at this time, it comes down to logistics. We have partnered with [DonorsChoose.org](http://donorschoose.org) to administer classroom funding prizes, which only works with public, US K-12 schools. According to DonorsChoose.org, the organization is better able to access consistent and accurate data that's available for public schools.

## 私は米国外に住んでますが、賞への応募資格はありますか？

Due to a small full-time staff, Code.org is unable to handle the logistics of administering international prizes. Because of this people outside the US are unable to qualify for prizes.
