## Teaching Computer Science

As an elementary teacher, computer science may be a new and foreign subject area. Just like any subject area, there are some tips and tricks unique to computer science in general, and our curriculum specifically, that we think will make your life a bit easier.

In addition to the detailed lesson plans, we've put together some helpful printables for both teachers and students. These guides and handouts can serve as helpful resources each time your students sit down at to tackle a new set of puzzles. One the following pages you'll see a flag to let you know which are teacher facing documents and which are for students.

### Puzzle Solving Recipe

Use the puzzle solving recipe with your students to help them perservere through difficult challenges. While many students will come up with their own approach for tackling the puzzles, following this recipe step-by-step provides structure and direction for students who need it.

### Debugging Recipe

Building on the Puzzle Solving Recipe, the Debugging Recipe is a more targeted approach for those times when a student just can't figure it out. The Debugging Recipe can also be a good tool for general use in the classroom when something is "buggy." Has the "lining up for recess" program gone awry? Time to break out the debugging recipe!

### Rethinking CS Strategies

This one's strictly for the teachers. We've come up with a list of classroom strategies that can help you deal with differentiation, attention, and collaboration.
