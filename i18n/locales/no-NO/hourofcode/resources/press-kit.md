## Hvordan få oppmerksomhet i media om Kodetimen

*For all press and media inquiries, contact <press@code.org>*

### Gode råd

  * Ta kontakt med media på epost to uker før arrangementet. Følg opp med epost og telefon om du ikke får svar.
  * Spør en ansatt ved skolen eller en frivillig om å ta bilder som kan deles på nett og sendes til pressen.
  * Skriv om Kodetimen på nettsiden din og i skoleavisen. Legg ut detaljer om arrangementet og bilder av elevene i aksjon.
  * Legg ut oppdateringer om din planer og annonser planlagte arrangement og legg ut bilder 8. Desember. Bruk hashtag **#Kodetimen** så Code.org kan se og promotere dine arrangement.

### Steg-for-steg guide:

**1. Plan your event**

  * Planlegg en samling for å sparke i gang Kodetimen.
  * Send [ett brev](<%= hoc_uri('/resources/#sample-emails') %>) til foreldre. Be dem om spre ordet videre.
  * Send [ett brev](<%= hoc_uri('/resources/#sample-emails') %>) til en lokal ordfører, fylkesordfører, rådmann eller en annen betydningsfull forrestningsperson for å spørre om de kan tale til studentene.
  * Organiser gruppeaktiviteter som for eksempel en en kode demo eller vis fram noe en student har gjort. 
  * Vis et [kodetime klipp](<%= hoc_uri('/') %>) fra Code.org eller ett av [disse](<%= hoc_uri('/resources#videos') %>) klippene som inspirasjon.

**2. Identify specific local reporters that cover education or local events.**

Think a local newspaper, TV station, radio station or blog.

Look online to find reporter contact information. If you can't find it, call the publication to ask, or email a general tips@PUBLICATIONNAME.com email address and ask for your message to be directed to the correct reporter.

**3. Contact local media**

The best way to reach out is by email. It should be short and communicate: why should other people care about this event? Include contact information (including a cellphone number) for who will be on site at the event. **See a [sample pitch to media](<%= hoc_uri('/resources#sample-emails') %>):**

**4. Prepare to field questions about your school event. Here are some examples:**

*Why is your school doing an Hour of Code?*

While all of us know that it’s important for students to learn how to navigate today’s tech-saturated world, many teachers aren’t experienced in computer science and don’t know where to start. This event is a chance for all of us to see what computer science is about.

We hope it’ll spark interest in students to keep learning. Research also shows that kids pick up programming concepts before they know how to read and write. In fact, their brains are more receptive to computer languages at a young age, just like foreign languages.

*Why is this important?*

In China, every students takes computer science to graduate high school. In the U.S., 90 percent of schools don’t even teach it. It’s time for us to catch up to the 21st century. We know that regardless of what our students do when they grow up, whether they go into medicine, business, politics, or the arts, knowing how to build technology will give them the confidence and know-how to succeed.

**More details and a quote you can use in materials**

"The Hour of Code is designed to demystify code and show that computer science is not rocket-science, anybody can learn the basics," said Hadi Partovi, founder and CEO of Code.org. "In one week last year, 15 million students tried an Hour of Code. Now we're aiming for 100 million worldwide to prove that the demand for relevant 21st century computer science education crosses all borders and knows no boundaries."

**About Code.org**

Code.org® is a 501c3 public non-profit dedicated to expanding participation in computer science and increasing participation by women and underrepresented students of color. Its vision is that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer programming. After launching in 2013, Code.org organized the Hour of Code campaign — which has introduced millions of students to computer science — partnered with more than 30 public school districts nationwide, and launched Code Studio, an open-source, online learning platform for all ages.
