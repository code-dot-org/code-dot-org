## Host a Family Code Night with the Hour of Code and invite parents to participate

Consider hosting a K-5 evening event and invite parents to join their students for an hour of computer science. This is a great way to engage the larger community and encourage parent support for computer science at your school. Our partners at Family Code Night have created an all-in-one event kit with planning checklist, presenter’s script, invitation emails, posters, powerpoints, and more to run your own event. [Click here to download the Event Kit](http://www.familycodenight.org/DownloadCodeDotOrg.html).
