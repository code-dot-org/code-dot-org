# How to plan your Hour of Code

### Join the movement and introduce your students to computer science with these steps.

Computational thinking helps nurture problem-solving skills, logic, and creativity. And technology is transforming every industry on the planet. Students today should learn how to create technology, not just use it. By starting early, they’ll have a foundation for success in any 21st-century career path.

Trying an Hour of Code is a simple and fun way to introduce students to computer science, perhaps for the very first time. Take a look at our [participation guide if you still have questions]({{ localized_files/participation_guide }}).

An Hour of Code can also be held **remotely, online**! To get started, check out our [tips for hosting a virtual Hour of Code event](https://hourofcode.com/us/how-to/virtual).

## 2. Explore activities and tutorials

We provide a variety of fun, [student-guided tutorials]({{ urls/learn }}) for all age groups and experience levels. It’s popular for students to try self-led tutorials, though many activities include lesson plans for teachers to guide discussion or extend the activity as well.

Explore the activities and decide ahead of time if you want to choose a single tutorial for all of your students, or let each child pick their own.

## 3. Create your plan for the day

### Think about your technology needs - computers are optional!

- Hour of Code를 경험하기 위한 최고의 선택은 인터넷이 연결된 컴퓨터입니다. But you don’t need a computer for every child, and you can even do the Hour of Code without a computer at all! For [unplugged activities](/learn), simply filter the Classroom Technology section to show options for “No computers or devices”.
- 튜토리얼들이 되는지 확실히 확인하시고 학생들 컴퓨터와 디바이스들에서도 제대로 소리나는 브라우저나 비디오에서 되는지 확인하세요 Have low bandwidth? Plan to show videos at the front of the class, so each student isn't downloading their own videos. Or try the offline tutorials.
- 소리와 관련된 튜토리얼을 수월하게 하기 위해서 학생들에게 헤드폰을 제공하거나, 그들이 가지고 있는 헤드폰을 가져오도록 요청하셔도 좋습니다.
- Don't have enough devices? Use [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q). 학생들을 짝 지어주면, 선생님보다 서로 서로 도움을 주고 받을 수 있도록 할 수 있습니다. 그렇게 함으로서 컴퓨터과학(정보과학)은 사회적이며 협동적이다라는 것을 알게 될 수 있습니다.

### Pick a day and time

People around the world join in the Hour of Code celebration during CS Education Week (December 9-13) when the latest tutorials and activities are released. But you can do an Hour of Code any day of the year!

## 4. Promote your Hour of Code

Now that you've planned your event, it's time to start promoting it!

### Tell your School and Community

Promote the Hour of Code to other teachers who may want to join in on the fun! This is also a great opportunity to reach out to your school’s PTSA or share in parent newsletters, letting them know their children may come home wanting to try more activities and tutorials!

### Let Volunteers Know by Registering Your Event

When you [sign-up your Hour of Code event](/), you’ll receive helpful email communications with news and tips for hosting a successful Hour of Code. It’s also how you can let local volunteers know your school is participating. Volunteers are a great resource and can come speak to your class about computer science or simply help your students with Hour of Code activities.

### Get your Students Excited

Lead up to the event by sharing [inspirational videos](/promote/resources) highlighting diverse people and creative ways that computer science can be used. Or order inspirational posters for your classroom! Students are more excited to participate in a subject when they see people who look like them encouraging it.

## 5. Start your Hour of Code Strong

Once your Hour of Code celebration has arrived, make sure you start your event strong with some of these tools and tips.

Invite a [local volunteer]({{ urls/volunteer_local }}) to inspire your students by talking about the breadth of possibilities in computer science. There are thousands of volunteers around the world ready to help with your Hour of Code through either a classroom visit or video chat with your students!

영감을 주는 동영상을 보여주세요:

- The original Code.org launch video, featuring Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and NBA star Chris Bosh. (There are [1 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYZF6oIZtfc), [5 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc), and [9 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1xS07N-FA) versions available)
- Find more inspirational [resources]({{ urls/inspire }}) and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNfpD8i4Sx7U0y2MccnrNZuP).

It’s okay if both you and your students are brand new to computer science. Here are some ideas to introduce your Hour of Code activity:

- Explain ways that technology impacts our lives, with examples both boys and girls will care about (talk about saving lives, helping people, connecting people, etc.).
- 수업에서, 일상생활 속에서 코드를 사용하는 것들을 나열하세요.
- See tips for getting girls interested in computer science [here]({{ urls/girls }}).

## 6. Get Coding!

Direct students to the activity

- Write the tutorial link on a whiteboard. Find the link listed on the [information for your selected tutorial]({{ urls/learn }}) under the number of participants.

When your students come across difficulties it's okay to respond:

- "나도 잘 모른단다. 우리 함께 생각해 보자."
- "컴퓨터과학(정보과학) 기술은 항상 우리가 원하는대로만 동작하지 않는단다."
- "프로그램을 배우는 것은 새로운 언어를 배우는 것과 같아; 곧바로 능숙할 수는 없는 것이란다."

What if a student finishes early?

- Students can see all tutorials and [try another Hour of Code activity]({{ urls/learn }}).
- 또는, 일찍 완료한 학생들에게 어려워서 잘 해결하지 못하고 있는 다른 학생들을 도와달라고 이야기 해보세요.
