The Hour of Code activities page now includes a [filter for activities compatible with screen readers](https://hourofcode.com/us/learn?platform=screenreader).

If you use a screen reader, the [Quorum tutorial for beginners](https://quorumlanguage.com/hourofcode/astro1.html) or the [Quorum tutorial for comfortable students](https://quorumlanguage.com/hourofcode/part1.html) are great places to start an Hour of Code. Quorum started as an interpreted language originally designed to be accessible through screen readers. It has become a general purpose programming language designed for any user. 아워오브코드를 너머 더 배우고 싶으면, 쿼럼 내 팀은 추가적인 도구와 커리큘럼을 갖고 있습니다. If you use a screen reader and are interested in robotics, try the [Dash Joins a Dance Circle activity](https://milnel2.github.io/blocks4alliOS/danceCircle1.html) from Lauren Milne.
