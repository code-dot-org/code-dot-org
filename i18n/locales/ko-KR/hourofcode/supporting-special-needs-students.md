# 아워오브코드를 하기 위한 장애 학생 지원

누구나 컴퓨터 과학 교육 주간 동안 아워오브코드를 해 볼 수 있습니다. Often, students with autism, ADHD or other learning differences find they love programming. 교실에 있는 모든 학생에게 시도해 보라고 북돋아 줍니다! In setting up the experience for your classroom, reward participation rather than completion. You can give everyone a [certificate]({{ supporting-special-needs-students/certificate }}) no matter how many puzzles or challenges they complete within the hour. [Pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q) is another great way to teach collaboration and have students work together to solve problems.

## Fit a variety of needs with unplugged and online tutorials

In finding the right activity for everyone in your class, consider both online and “unplugged” options that do not require computers. Unplugged activities allow students to get hands on with computer science concepts. The [Big Event](https://studio.code.org/s/course1/stage/15/puzzle/1) puts teachers in control over the actions of students, allowing for a great opportunity to tailor the content to the abilities of each student.

For other students, the accommodations available on the computer may allow them to participate better than an unplugged choice. For example, students who are deaf or hard of hearing can participate fully in the online tutorials.

The most inclusive choice may also depend on whether you have an accessible computer lab or laptops.

For example, do your students have reduced mobility or dexterity? If all your students have access to technology at your school, ask your students or tech teacher what accommodations your students typically use with the computers available.

## Sensory Impairments

### Students who are blind or low vision

For students who use a screen reader, the [Quorum tutorial for beginners](https://quorumlanguage.com/hourofcode/astro1.html) or the [Quorum tutorial for comfortable students](https://quorumlanguage.com/hourofcode/part1.html) is a great place to start. Quorum started as an interpreted language designed to be accessible to screen reader users. Eventually, it became a general purpose programming language designed for any user. You can use these Hour of Code tutorials with your entire classroom. 아워오브코드를 너머 더 배우고 싶으면, 쿼럼 내 팀은 추가적인 도구와 커리큘럼을 갖고 있습니다.

If your student uses other accommodations in technology classes, you may use those to help with Hour of Code as well. These can include larger monitors, software screen magnification, high contrast settings in their operating system, voice control and more.

### Students who are deaf or hard of hearing

The [Code.org tutorials](https://studio.code.org/) are all designed to be used with or without sound. All the videos have captions. Some students can also benefit from headphones set to a higher volume.
