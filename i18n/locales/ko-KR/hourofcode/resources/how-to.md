# 1시간짜리 Hour of Code 교육 방법

## 1) Sign up

  * Sign up to host an [Hour of Code](%= resolve_url('/') %) during <%= campaign_date('short') %>.
  * Promote your [Hour of Code](%= resolve_url('/resources') %) and encourage others to host.

## 2) Watch this how-to video <iframe width="500" height="255" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/tQeSke4hIds" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
## 3) Choose a tutorial:

We’ll host a variety of [fun, hour-long tutorials](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/learn') %) for students of all ages, created by a variety of partners. *New tutorials are coming to kick off the Hour of Code before <%= campaign_date('full') %>.* [Try current tutorials.](%= resolve_url("https://code.org/learn") %)

**모든 Hour of Code 튜토리얼들은:**

  * Require minimal prep-time for teachers
  * 학생 자신의 진도와 수준에 맞추어 자기주도 학습이 가능합니다.

## 4) Plan your technology needs - computers are optional

The best Hour of Code experience will be with Internet-connected computers. You **don’t** need a computer for every child, and can even do the Hour of Code without a computer at all.

  * Test tutorials on student computers or devices. Make sure they work properly on browsers with sound and video.
  * Provide headphones for your class, or ask students to bring their own, if the tutorial you choose works best with sound.
  * **Don't have enough devices?** Use [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q). When students partner up, they help each other and rely less on the teacher. They’ll also see that computer science is social and collaborative.
  * **통신 속도가 느리다면?** 교실 앞에서 비디오를 보여주면, 학생들 모두가 비디오를 다운로드 받으면서 보지 않아도 됩니다. 아니면, 오프라인용 언플러그드 활동을 활용해 보세요.

## 5) Inspire students to start your Hour of Code

**Kick off your Hour of Code by inspiring students and discussing how computer science impacts every part of our lives.**

**Show an inspirational video:**

  * 빌 게이츠(Bill Gates), 마크 주커버그(Mark Zuckerberg)와 NBA 농구 스타인 크리스 보쉬(Chris Bosh)의 원래 Code.org 소개 동영상이 있습니다.([ 1분 ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYZF6oIZtfc), [ 5분 ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc), [ 9분 ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1xS07N-FA) 버전들이 있습니다.)
  * [Hour of Code 2013 동영상](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC5FbmsH4fw), 또는 <% if @country == 'uk' %> [Hour of Code 2014 동영상](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96B5-JGA9EQ) <% else %> [Hour of Code 2014 동영상](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7AjDMz_dc&index=2&list=PLzdnOPI1iJNe1WmdkMG-Ca8cLQpdEAL7Q) 이 있습니다. <% end %>
  * [오바마 대통령은 모든 학생들이 컴퓨터과학(정보과학)을 배울 수 있도록 도와달라고 요청하고 있습니다.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvmhE1J9PY)
  * Find more inspirational video [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNfpD8i4Sx7U0y2MccnrNZuP).

**It’s okay if both you and your students are brand new to computer science. Here are some ideas to introduce your Hour of Code activity:**

  * Explain ways technology impacts our lives, with examples both boys and girls will care about (Talk about saving lives, helping people, connecting people, etc.).
  * As a class, list things that use code in everyday life.
  * See tips for getting girls interested in computer science [here](<%= resolve_url('https://code.org/girls') %>).

**Want more teaching ideas?** Check out [best practices](http://www.slideshare.net/TeachCode/hour-of-code-best-practices-for-successful-educators-51273466) from experienced educators.

## 6) Code!

**Direct students to the activity**

  * Write the tutorial link on a whiteboard. Find the link listed on the [information for your selected tutorial](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/learn') %) under the number of participants.

**When your students come across difficulties it's okay to respond:**

  * “I don’t know. Let’s figure this out together.”
  * “Technology doesn’t always work out the way we want.”
  * “Learning to program is like learning a new language; you won’t be fluent right away.”

**What to do if a student finishes early?**

  * Students can see all tutorials and try another Hour of Code activity at [<%= resolve_url('code.org/learn') %>](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/learn') %)
  * 또는, 일찍 완료한 학생들에게 어려워서 잘 해결하지 못하고 있는 다른 학생들을 도와달라고 이야기 해보세요.

## What comes after the Hour of Code?

The Hour of Code is just the first step on a journey to learn more about how technology works and how to create software applications. To continue this journey, [encourage your children to learn online](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/learn/beyond') %).
