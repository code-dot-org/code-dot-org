## Hour of Code 이벤트에 언론의 관심을 이끄는 방법

*For all press and media inquiries, contact <press@code.org>*

### 핵심 팁들

- 이벤트를 개최하기 2주 전에 이메일로 미디어들을 보내드립니다. 처음에 연락이 닿지 않으면 이메일과 휴대폰으로 알림이 발송됩니다.
- 학교 직원들이나 자원봉사자들에게 행사 사진을 찍어 온라인으로 공유하거나 언론에 보낼 수 있도록 도움을 요청하세요.
- 여러분의 웹사이트와 홈페이지에 Hour of Code에 대한 글을 올리고, 학교 신문에도 게제하세요. 여러분이 진행한 이벤트의 상세한 내용, 학생들의 사진과 활동을 올리세요.
- 페이스북과 트위터에, 당신의 계획을 업데이트하고 공유하세요. 12월 5일부터 11일까지 당신의 이벤트를 알리고 사진을 포스팅 하세요. **#HourOfCode** 해쉬태그를 사용하시면 Code.org가 보고 당신의 이벤트를 홍보할 수 있도록 해주세요.

### 단계적 가이드:

**1. Plan your event**

- Hour of Code를 시작하기 위한 단계적 절차들을 계획하세요.
- 다음 [편지를](%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#sample-emails') %)부모님들께 보내주세요. 그리고 널리 알려달라고 요청해주세요.
- [이 편지를](<%= hoc_uri('/resources/#sample-emails') %>) 지역 시장, 시의원, 공무원, 지역 사업가들에게 보내 행사에 참여해서 학생들에게 강연할 수 있도록 해주세요.
- 모둠 활동(언플러그드 프로그래밍 활동과 같은...)을 조직하거나, 학생들이 만들어낸 것들을 발표하고, 여러 가지 활동들을 이끌어내세요.
- Code.org의 [Hour of Code 동영상](%= resolve_url('/') %) 이나, [다른 동영상들을 보여주시면서](%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#videos') %) 영감을 불어넣어 주세요.

**2. Identify specific local reporters that cover education or local events.**

Think a local newspaper, TV station, radio station or blog.

Look online to find reporter contact information. If you can't find it, call the publication to ask, or email a general tips@PUBLICATIONNAME.com email address and ask for your message to be directed to the correct reporter.

**3. Contact local media**

The best way to reach out is by email. It should be short and communicate: why should other people care about this event? Include contact information (including a cellphone number) for who will be on site at the event. **See a [sample pitch to media](%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#sample-emails') %).**

**4. Prepare to field questions about your school event. Here are some examples:**

*Why is your school doing an Hour of Code?*

While all of us know that it’s important for students to learn how to navigate today’s tech-saturated world, many teachers aren’t experienced in computer science and don’t know where to start. This event is a chance for all of us to see what computer science is about.

We hope it’ll spark interest in students to keep learning. Research also shows that kids can pick up programming concepts before they know how to read and write. In fact, their brains are more receptive to computer languages at a young age, just like foreign languages.

*Why is this important?*

Technology is transforming every industry on the planet. In 2015, 7 million openings in the U.S. were in occupations—including art and design—that value coding skills. But 75 percent of schools in the U.S. don't teach computer science. It’s time for us to catch up to the 21st century. We know that regardless of what our students do when they grow up, whether they go into medicine, business, politics, or the arts, knowing how to build technology will give them confidence and a competitive edge.

**More details and a quote you can use in materials**

"The Hour of Code is designed to demystify code and show that computer science is not rocket science—anybody can learn the basics," said Hadi Partovi, founder and CEO of Code.org. "Over 100 million students worldwide have tried an Hour of Code. The demand for relevant 21st century computer science education crosses all borders and knows no boundaries."

**About Code.org**

Code.org is a 501c3 public non-profit dedicated to expanding participation in computer science and increasing participation by women and underrepresented students of color. Its vision is that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer programming. After launching in 2013, Code.org organized the Hour of Code campaign – which has introduced over 100 million students to computer science to date – and partnered with 70 public school districts nationwide to expand computer science programs. Code.org is supported by philanthropic donations from corporations, foundations and generous individuals, including Microsoft, Infosys Foundation, USA, The Ballmer Family Giving, Omidyar Network and others.
