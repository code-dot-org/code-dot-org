# Hour of Code වැඩසටහනක් සංවිධානය කිරීම සඳහා ලියාපදිංචී වීම පිලිබඳ ඔබට ස්තුතියි!

<br /> **The Hour of Code runs during {{ campaign_date/full }} and we'll be in touch about new tutorials and other exciting updates as they come out. In the meantime, what can you do now?**

As a special thank you to Hour of Code organizers, we have a new poster set featuring Malala, Stephen Curry, Shakira and more available to order at a [50% discount from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/promocode/A3QAYNZUZTSSNQ). This year, each set comes with 6 posters and 126 "I did the Hour of Code" stickers. With the discount you'll get them for less than our cost to make them. Supplies are limited, so order your posters soon. If you're not in the United States, you can [download and print all posters]({{ promote/promote_posters_url }}).

## 1. Spread the word in your school and community

You just joined the Hour of Code movement. Tell your friends with **#HourOfCode**!

{{ social_media_hoc }} <br /> Encourage others to participate [with our sample emails.]({{ promote/sample_emails }}) Contact your principal and challenge every classroom at your school to sign up. Recruit a local group — boy/girl scouts club, church, university, veterans group, labor union, or even some friends. You don't have to be in school to learn new skills. Invite a local politician or policy maker to visit your school for the Hour of Code. It can help build support for computer science in your area beyond one hour.

Use these [posters, banners, stickers, videos and more]({{ promote/resources }}) for your own event.

## 2. ඔබේ වැඩසටහනට උදව් කිරීමට ස්වෙඡාසේවකයින් සොයන්න.

[Search our volunteer map]({{ urls/volunteer_local }}) for volunteers who can visit your classroom or video chat remotely to inspire your students about the breadth of possibilities with computer science.
