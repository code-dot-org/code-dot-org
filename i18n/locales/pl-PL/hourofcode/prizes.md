# Frequently Asked Questions {#faq}

## Does your whole school have to enter to win the $10,000 in hardware?

Yes. Your whole school has to participate to be eligible for the prize but only one person needs to register and submit the Hardware Prize application form [here](<%= hoc_uri('/prizes') %>).

## Does your whole school have to enter to win a the tech chat?

## Can non-public schools win the video chat prize?

Yes! Private and independent schools are eligible along with public schools to win the video chat prizes.

## Can non-US schools win the video chat prize?

No, unfortunately, because of logistics we are unable to offer the video chat prize to schools outside of the U.S. and Canada. All international organizers **are** eligible to receive Dropbox space or Skype credit.

## Why is the $10,000 hardware prize only available to public schools?

We would love to help teachers in public and private schools alike, but at this time, it comes down to logistics. We have partnered with [DonorsChoose.org](http://donorschoose.org) to administer classroom funding prizes, which only works with public, US K-12 schools. According to DonorsChoose.org, the organization is better able to access consistent and accurate data that's available for public schools.

## I’m outside the United States. Can I qualify for prizes?

Due to a small full-time staff, Code.org is unable to handle the logistics of administering international prizes. Because of this people outside the US are unable to qualify for prizes.

## When is the deadline to apply for the hardware prize?

To qualify, your entire school must register for the Hour of Code as well as complete the [Hardware Application form](<%= hoc_uri('/prizes') %>) by November 14, 2014. One school in every U.S. state will receive a class-set of computers. Code.org will select and notify winners via email by December 1, 2014.

## When is the deadline to be eligible to win a tech chat?

To qualify, you must register your classroom for the Hour of Code by November 14, 2014. Classrooms will win a video chat with a celebrity. Code.org will select and notify winners via email by December 1, 2014.

## When will I be notified if my school or classroom wins a prize?

To qualify, your entire school must register for the Hour of Code as well as complete the [Hardware Application form](<%= hoc_uri('/prizes') %>) by November 14, 2014. Code.org will select and notify winners via email by December 1, 2014.

## If my whole school can’t do the Hour of Code during Computer Science Education Week (Dec. 8-14), can I still qualify for prizes?

Yes, just be sure to submit a logistics plan that outlines how your whole school is participating over a reasonable length of time and register for the Hour of Code by November 14th. <% end %>
