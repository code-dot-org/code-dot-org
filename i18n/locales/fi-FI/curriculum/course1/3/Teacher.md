## K-1 Lesson Overview

In this first online activity students will become familiar with basic mouse use and the block-based programming interface they will be using throughout the course. Students will begin by simply dragging images on screen and then progress to dragging puzzle pieces into the proper order.

## Getting Started

### <a name="GetStarted"></a>Introduction

Ask students if they have ever used a computer mouse before (or trackpad, touchscreen, whatever device they'll be using).

  * What does the mouse do?
  * How does moving the mouse affect the cursor on the screen?
  * You will now be using the mouse to put together puzzle pieces on the computer.
  * Pushing down on the mouse button is like closing your hand on a real puzzle piece and letting go of the button is like opening your hand to drop the piece. Make sure you keep your mouse button pressed while you drag each piece.
  * Watch the pair programming video together and discuss the role of the driver and navigator.

## Activity

### <a name="Activity"></a>[Jigsaw: Learn to drag and drop](http://learn.code.org/s/course1/stage/3/puzzle/1)

Pair programming works best with two students to a computer and clear expectations of who is the driver and who is the navigator. You may want to create a visual reminder, like hats or sashes, to identify the driver and the navigator.

# Lesson Tip

When puzzle pieces are connected and you want to separate them, you have to drag off from the bottom of the stack. Dragging the top will move the whole stack of pieces.

## Extended Learning

<a name="Extended"></a>Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### Human Computer

Use real puzzle pieces and pair students into the computer and the user. The user "controls" the computer with a mouse to put the puzzle together.
