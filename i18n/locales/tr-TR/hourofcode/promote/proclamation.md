#### "Bilgisayar bilim eğitim haftası" nın hedeflerini ve ideallerini destekleme

Madem ki Bilgisayar Bilimleri Egitim Haftasi bilgisayar bilimlerinin toplumumuzu donustrumede oynadigi kritik rolu ve nasil bilgisayar bilimleri yenilige yon verdigini ve ekonomik olanaklar sagladiginin altini ciziyor;

Madem ki bilgisayar teknolojileri modern kulturun vazgecilmez bir parcasi ve o, insanlarin nasil birbirileri ile ve etrafindaki dunya ile iletisimini degistiriyor;

Madem ki bilgisayar bilimleri sanayii donusturuyor, yeni ticari alanlar olusturuyor, tum bilim dallarinda yenilige oncu oluyor, ve varolan ekonomik sektorlerde uretkenligi desekliyor;

Madem ki bilgisayar bilimleri alani American ekonomik uretimine onemli destek saglayan ekonomimizin bilgi teknolojileri sektorune zemin teskil ediyor;

Madem ki bilgisayar bilimleri alani dijital cag icin bit temel bilimdir;

Whereas the information technology sector is uniquely positioned to help with economic recovery through the research and development of new innovations;

Whereas the outlook for computer science jobs is bright with over 500,000 open computing positions across the country;

Whereas providing students the chance to participate in high-quality computer science activities exposes them to the rich opportunities the field offers and provides critical thinking skills that will serve them throughout their lives;

Whereas all students deserve a thorough preparation in computer science education, including access to the qualified teachers, technology, and age-appropriate curriculum needed to learn computer science at the elementary and secondary levels of education;

Whereas computer science education has challenges to address, including counting computer science classes towards high school graduation requirements, and providing professional development for computer science teachers;

Whereas participating in an Hour of Code during Computer Science Education Week can serve to demystify the field of computer science and encourage more students to take up further studies of computer science;

Whereas the field of computer science has significant equity barriers to address, including attracting more participation by females and underrepresented minorities to all levels and branches;

Whereas Grace Murray Hopper, one of the first females in the field of computer science, engineered new programming languages and pioneered standards for computer systems which laid the foundation for many advancements in computer science; and

Whereas the week of {{ campaign_date/start_long }}, in honor of Grace Hopper's birthday, is designated as ‘Computer Science Education Week’: Now, therefore, be it <br />

Resolved, That the (HOUSE OR SENATE, STATE, COUNTY, CITY OR SCHOOL BOARD) --

(1) supports the designation of Computer Science Education Week ({{ campaign_date/full }});

(2) encourages schools, educators, parents and policymakers to participate in Computer Science Education Week by enabling their students to participate in the Hour of Code;

(3) encourages schools, teachers, researchers, universities, business leaders, and policymakers to identify mechanisms for teachers to receive cutting edge professional development to provide sustainable learning experiences in computer science at all educational levels and encourage students to be exposed to computer science concepts;

(4) encourages policymakers to remove barriers that prevent computer science classes from being counted as math or science credits toward graduation requirements;

(5) encourages opportunities, including through existing programs, for females and underrepresented minorities in computer science.
