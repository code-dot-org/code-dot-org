# Bir saat kodu oluşturduğunuz için teşekkürler!

<br /> **The Hour of Code runs during {{ campaign_date/full }} and we'll be in touch about new tutorials and other exciting updates as they come out. In the meantime, what can you do now?**

As a special thank you to Hour of Code organizers, we have a new poster set featuring Malala, Stephen Curry, Shakira and more available to order at a [50% discount from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/promocode/A3QAYNZUZTSSNQ). This year, each set comes with 6 posters and 126 "I did the Hour of Code" stickers. With the discount you'll get them for less than our cost to make them. Supplies are limited, so order your posters soon. If you're not in the United States, you can [download and print all posters]({{ promote/promote_posters_url }}).

## 1. Okuldakilere ve tanıdıklarınıza Kod Saati'ni duyurun

You just joined the Hour of Code movement. Tell your friends with **#HourOfCode**!

{{ social_media_hoc }} <br /> Encourage others to participate [with our sample emails.]({{ promote/sample_emails }}) Contact your principal and challenge every classroom at your school to sign up. Recruit a local group — boy/girl scouts club, church, university, veterans group, labor union, or even some friends. Yeni beceriler öğrenmek için okulda olmana gerek yok. Invite a local politician or policy maker to visit your school for the Hour of Code. Bu, bilgisayar bilimlerini bir saatlik mesafede desteklemene yardım eder.

Use these [posters, banners, stickers, videos and more]({{ promote/resources }}) for your own event.

## 1. Size yardımcı olacak kendi dilinizde konuşan yerel gönüllüler bulun.
