# Ödüller - SSS

## Donanımda 10.000$ kazanmak için tüm okulunun katılması mı gerekli?

Evet. Ödül almaya uygun olabilmek için tüm okulunun katılması zorunlu ama sadece bir kişinin Donanım Ödül uygulamasına [buradan](<%= hoc_uri('/prizes') %>) kayıt olup, başvurması gerekli.

## Does your whole school have to enter to win a the tech chat?

Her çeşit okul (devlet ya da özel) bu ödülü kazanmak için uygundur. Tüm okulunun başvurması gerekli.

## Devlet okulu dışındaki okullar da video chat ödülünü kazanabilirler mi?

Yes! Private and independent schools are eligible along with public schools to win the video chat prizes.

## Can non-US schools win the video chat prize?

No, unfortunately, because of logistics we are unable to offer the video chat prize to schools outside of the U.S. and Canada.

## Why is the $10,000 hardware prize only available to public schools?

We would love to help teachers in public and private schools alike, but at this time, it comes down to logistics. We have partnered with [DonorsChoose.org](http://donorschoose.org) to administer classroom funding prizes, which only works with public, US K-12 schools. According to DonorsChoose.org, the organization is better able to access consistent and accurate data that's available for public schools.

## I’m outside the United States. Can I qualify for prizes?

Due to a small full-time staff, Code.org is unable to handle the logistics of administering international prizes. Because of this people outside the US are unable to qualify for prizes.

## When is the deadline to apply for the hardware prize?

To qualify, your entire school must register for the Hour of Code as well as complete the [Hardware Application form](<%= hoc_uri('/prizes') %>) by November 16, 2015.

## When will I be notified if my school or classroom wins a prize?

## If my whole school can’t do the Hour of Code during Computer Science Education Week (Dec. 7-13), can I still qualify for prizes?

Yes, just be sure to submit a logistics plan that outlines how your whole school is participating over a reasonable length of time and register for the Hour of Code by November 16th.
