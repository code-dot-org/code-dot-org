        title: செயல்பாடுகள்
        desc: In this lesson, students will make a suncatcher out of string, beads, and a special charm. The students will follow a series of repetitive steps, then be asked to identify certain sets of "skills" that are duplicated several times. Once those skills are defined, they will be called from a main program and the whole beautiful process of creation will be recorded on a single sheet of paper. The final program will be geared toward the entire class, whatever their type of string, beads, and charms. To effectively allow for this, students will need to "abstract out" the details of their specific materials and create vague terms for an individual's supplies.  This use of generic placeholders is a wonderful introduction to variables.

      BinaryImages_2018:
        title: Binary Images
        desc: Though many people think of binary as strictly zeros and ones, our previous courses taught students that information can be represented in a variety of binary options.  This lesson takes that concept one step further as it illustrates how a computer can store even more complex information (such as images and colors) in binary, as well.
      PaperPlanes_2018:
        title: 'Real-life Algorithms: Paper Planes'
        desc: This lesson calls out ways we use algorithms in our daily lives, specifically making paper airplanes. This lesson also focuses on the bigger picture of computer science and how algorithms play an essential part.
      GettingLoopy_2018:
        title: Getting Loopy
        desc: This lesson introduces the programming concept of loops (repeated instructions) through a dance activity. Students will learn simple choreography, then be instructed to repeat it.
      BinaryBracelets_2018:
        title: Binary Bracelets
        desc: Students create bracelets as a binary representations of the first letter of their name. Students learn that data can be represented and stored in more than one way.
