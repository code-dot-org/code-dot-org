      Course 4 Artist Params 10_instruction: "You can call functions from inside\nother functions! Using your \"shape\" function as a base, create 3 house shapes\neach 20 pixels larger than the last starting at 50 pixels in length. Using\na counter loop might be helpful. "
      Course 4 Artist Params 11_instruction: "How about a function called \"pinwheel\"\nthat takes three parameters - \"sides,\" \"length\" and \"repeat.\" You can\ncalculate how much to turn after each shape using the same math you used to\nfigure out the turns for a shape of \"sides\". Can you recreate this picture?\nHere's a tip each shape is 100 pixel's in length."

      Course 4 Artist Params 2_instruction: "That triangle function would be a whole\nlot more useful if it could draw triangles of different sizes. I've added\na parameter for line length, but it doesn't do anything yet. Can you update\nthe function so it uses the \"length\" parameter when it draws each side?\nThe triangle sizes are 150 pixels, 75 pixels and 25 pixels."
      Course 4 Artist Params 3_instruction: "Awesome, can you draw each of these\ntriangles with that new function? The first is 25 pixels long, the second\nis 50, and the third is 75. "
      Course 4 Artist Params 4_instruction: "Can you add a new function called square?\nIt should also take a length parameter, just like the triangle. This time\ndraw 3 squares 25, 50 and 75 pixels in length,100 pixels apart."
      Course 4 Artist Params 5_instruction: "Use both of your new functions to draw\nthis picture. To make this easier you use a loop with a \"counter\" parameter.\n"
      Course 4 Artist Params 6_instruction: "Let's edit this \"draw a shape\" function.\nIt already has a \"length\" parameter. Now, let's edit the function to also\nadd a \"sides\" parameter. Remember the angle to turn for a given shape is\n360 divided by the sides it has. Hint: lengths for each shape are the triangle\nis 100 pixels, the hexagon is 25 pixels and the square is 50 pixels. "

Let's have some fun and use the \"draw a\nshape\" function with \"sides\" and \"length\" parameters. Can you re create\nthese shapes? The square counter should be 5/100/5, the triangle counter should\nbe 10/100/10 and the hexagon is 2/100/2."

      Course 4 Artist Vars 10_instruction: "Here's an algorithm that draws a triangle\nout of smaller triangles. Can you modify it so that it uses the \"sides\"\nvariable to draw each triangle? Look through the code, and every time you\nsee the number 3, replace it with your \"sides\" variable. Remember to use\nthe \"set sides\" block."
      Course 4 Artist Vars 11_instruction: "Here’s more complicated code using the\nsame concepts from the last puzzle - what should you set the \"sides\" variable\nto in order to draw this picture made of squares?"
      Course 4 Artist Vars 12_instruction: "Let's set the \"sides\" variable to\n5. The more sides we add to this algorithm, the bigger this whole pattern\ngets! Notice that there is another variable called \"length\". We can now\nuse that wherever we have a \"move forward.\" Set the \"length\" variable\nto 75 for this shape."
      Course 4 Artist Vars 13_instruction: "When a shape has lots of sides, each\nside needs to be shorter if you want the whole pattern to fit on the screen.\n\\r\nLet's recreate the algorithm for this amazing pattern, but instead of\nmanually setting the `length` variable, let's use a math block with the `sides`\nvariable inside to make sure that each shape fits correctly.

      Course 4 Artist Vars 2_instruction: "Instead of using \"move forward by 150,\"\nthe \"move\" block is now referencing a variable called \"length.\" Can you\nset \"length\" to 150 to draw this new triangle?"

      Course 4 Artist Vars 8_instruction: "Free Play: Experiment with the number\nof sides this shape has. Can you change the algorithm so that the overall\nsize of the shape stays the same, no matter how many sides it has? Hint: If\nyou divide your starting length by the number of sides, the length of each\nside will get shorter as the number of sides gets higher."
      Course 4 Artist Vars 9_instruction: "Modify this algorithm so it uses the \"sides\"\nvariable instead of a fixed number to draw a triangle. Don't forget to use\nthe \"set sides to\" block."
