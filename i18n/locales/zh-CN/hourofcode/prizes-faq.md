## 非美国的学校可以获得视频聊天奖励吗？

No, unfortunately, because of logistics we are unable to offer the video chat prize to schools outside of the U.S. and Canada.

## 为什么只有公立学校可以获得10000美元硬件奖励？

We would love to help teachers in public and private schools alike, but at this time, it comes down to logistics. We have partnered with [DonorsChoose.org](http://donorschoose.org) to administer classroom funding prizes, which only works with public, US K-12 schools. According to DonorsChoose.org, the organization is better able to access consistent and accurate data that's available for public schools.

## 我是在美国以外，我可以有资格获奖吗？

Due to a small full-time staff, Code.org is unable to handle the logistics of administering international prizes. Because of this people outside the US are unable to qualify for prizes.

## 申请硬件奖励的截止日期是什么时间？

To qualify, your entire school must register for the Hour of Code as well as complete the [Hardware Application form](%= resolve_url('/prizes') %) by November 16, 2015. 在美国各州都将有一所学校收到我们为其班级配备的电脑。 Code.org will select and notify winners via email by December 1, 2015.

## If my whole school can’t do the Hour of Code during Computer Science Education Week (Dec. 7-13), can I still qualify for prizes?

Yes, just be sure to submit a logistics plan that outlines how your whole school is participating over a reasonable length of time and register for the Hour of Code by November 16th.
