# 感谢注册并组织编程一小时活动！

<br /> **The Hour of Code runs during {{ campaign_date/full }} and we'll be in touch about new tutorials and other exciting updates as they come out. In the meantime, what can you do now?**

As a special thank you to Hour of Code organizers, we have a new poster set featuring Malala, Stephen Curry, Shakira and more available to order at a [50% discount from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/promocode/A3QAYNZUZTSSNQ). This year, each set comes with 6 posters and 126 "I did the Hour of Code" stickers. With the discount you'll get them for less than our cost to make them. Supplies are limited, so order your posters soon. If you're not in the United States, you can [download and print all posters]({{ promote/promote_posters_url }}).

## 1. 在您的学校和社区传播这个信息

You just joined the Hour of Code movement. Tell your friends with **#HourOfCode**!

{{ social_media_hoc }} <br /> Encourage others to participate [with our sample emails.]({{ promote/sample_emails }}) Contact your principal and challenge every classroom at your school to sign up. Recruit a local group — boy/girl scouts club, church, university, veterans group, labor union, or even some friends. 你不必在学校学习新的技能。 Invite a local politician or policy maker to visit your school for the Hour of Code. 它能为你在你领域的计算机科学找到一小时之外的支持。

Use these [posters, banners, stickers, videos and more]({{ promote/resources }}) for your own event.

## 2. 找当地的志愿者来帮助你的活动

[Search our volunteer map]({{ urls/volunteer_local }}) for volunteers who can visit your classroom or video chat remotely to inspire your students about the breadth of possibilities with computer science.

## 3. 计划您的《编程一小时》

Choose an [Hour of Code activity](https://hourofcode.com/learn) for your classroom and [review this how-to guide]({{ urls/how_to_guide }}).

### 4. Stock up on swag

Order materials to help get students excited about your event by heading to the Code.org [Amazon store](https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/8557B2A6-EBF2-4C9F-95C5-C3256FBA0220). [Order posters](https://www.amazon.com/promocode/A3QAYNZUZTSSNQ) (and get an extra 50% off), Hour of Code kits, stickers, and more! But hurry, supplies are limited.
