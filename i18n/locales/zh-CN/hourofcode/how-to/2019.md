# 如何计划你的“编程一小时”

### 参与活动，并用下面的步骤向学生们介绍他们第一个小时的计算机科学。 编程一小时的课程哪怕是对初学者来说都非常容易上手！ 如果你需要额外的帮助，你可以寻找[本地志愿者]({{ urls/volunteer_local }})来协助开展班内“编程一小时”。

### 若仍有疑问，请参见[活动指南]({{ localized_files/participation_guide }})。

## 1. 观看此指导视频 <iframe width="500" height="255" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/SrnvvWDm73k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## 2. 探索活动和教程

我们为所有年龄段和经验水平的人们提供各种有趣的[学生指导教程]({{ urls/learn }}) 。 尽管许多活动都包括供教师指导讨论或扩展活动范围的教学计划，但学生还是很喜欢尝试自主教程。

Explore the activities and decide ahead of time if you want to choose a single tutorial for all of your students, or let each child pick their own.

## 3. Create your Plan for the Day

### Think about your technology needs - computers are optional!

- 要获得编程一小时活动的最佳体验，需要一台联网的电脑。 But you don’t need a computer for every child, and you can even do the Hour of Code without a computer at all! For [unplugged activities](/learn), simply filter the Classroom Technology section to show options for “No computers or devices”.
- 在学生计算机或设备上测试这些指南，确保它们在播放器上的声音和视频能够正常运作。 Have low bandwidth? Plan to show videos at the front of the class, so each student isn't downloading their own videos. Or try the offline tutorials.
- 如果教程包含音频，那么应提前准备耳机，或者让学生自带耳机。
- Don't have enough devices? Use [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q). 学生之间搭档之后，他们会互相帮助并减少对老师的依赖。 他们将明白编程也是一种社交和协作。

### Pick a day and time

People around the world join in the Hour of Code celebration during CS Education Week (December 9-13) when the latest tutorials and activities are released. But you can do an Hour of Code any day of the year!

## 4. Promote your Hour of Code

Now that you've planned your event, it's time to start promoting it!

### Tell your School and Community

Promote the Hour of Code to other teachers who may want to join in on the fun! This is also a great opportunity to reach out to your school’s PTSA or share in parent newsletters, letting them know their children may come home wanting to try more activities and tutorials!

### Let Volunteers Know by Registering Your Event

When you [sign-up your Hour of Code event](/), you’ll receive helpful email communications with news and tips for hosting a successful Hour of Code. It’s also how you can let local volunteers know your school is participating. Volunteers are a great resource and can come speak to your class about computer science or simply help your students with Hour of Code activities.

### Get your Students Excited

Lead up to the event by sharing [inspirational videos](/promote/resources) highlighting diverse people and creative ways that computer science can be used. Or order inspirational posters for your classroom! Students are more excited to participate in a subject when they see people who look like them encouraging it.

## 5. Start your Hour of Code Strong

Once your Hour of Code celebration has arrived, make sure you start your event strong with some of these tools and tips.

Invite a [local volunteer]({{ urls/volunteer_local }}) to inspire your students by talking about the breadth of possibilities in computer science. There are thousands of volunteers around the world ready to help with your Hour of Code through either a classroom visit or video chat with your students!

播放鼓舞人心的视频：

- 正版的 Code.org 推出包括比尔盖茨、马克·扎克伯格和 NBA 球星克里斯. 波什的视频。 （有[1 分钟的](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYZF6oIZtfc)，[5 分钟的](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc)和[9 分钟的](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1xS07N-FA)）
- Find more inspirational [resources]({{ urls/inspire }}) and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNfpD8i4Sx7U0y2MccnrNZuP).

It’s okay if both you and your students are brand new to computer science. Here are some ideas to introduce your Hour of Code activity:

- 通过男孩和女孩们都关心的例子，介绍科技如何影响我们的生活（比如拯救生命，帮助人们，连接人们等）
- 让全班一起来列出每天生活中用到编程的地方。
- [在此处查看让女孩对计算机科学感兴趣的小贴士]({{ urls/girls }})。


## 6. Get Coding!

指导学生参与活动

- 在白板上写下教程链接 Find the link listed on the [information for your selected tutorial]({{ urls/learn }}) under the number of participants.

当你的学生遇到困难时，你完全可以用这样的方式回答：

- “I don’t know. Let’s figure this out together.”
- “科学技术并不总是同我们期望的方式一样工作。”
- “学习编程就像是学习一门新的语言（事实上就是-我们一直都将学习编程称作学习编程语言，你现在学的这种叫Blocky?）；你不会马上就说得很流利。”

如果一个学生提前完成了怎么办？

- Students can see all tutorials and [try another Hour of Code activity]({{ urls/learn }}).
- 或者可以让提早完成的学生去帮助那些在活动中遇到困难的同学。
