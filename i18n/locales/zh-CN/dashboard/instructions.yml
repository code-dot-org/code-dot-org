      Big Game Animation 1 (copy 1)_instruction: |
        Now that you've learned to write
        simple linear functions, let's work on using them to add some movement to
        our game. Click play to see what your game can currently do (not much!), update
        any variables you like, and then click finish to move on.
      Big Game Animation 1_instruction: |
        Now that you've learned to write simple
        linear functions, let's work on using them to add some movement to our game.
        Click "Run" to see what your game can currently do (not much!), update any
        variables you like, and then click finish to move on.
      Big Game Animation 2 (copy 1)_instruction: |
        The function 'update-target'
        function takes the target's current x value, and returns an updated value.
        Complete the 'update-target' function so that it adds to the x value each
        time it is called. The more you add to x, the faster the target will go.
      Big Game Animation 2_instruction: |
        The update-target function takes the target's
        current x value, and returns an updated value. Complete the update-target
        function so that it adds to the x value each time it is called. The more you
        add to x, the faster the target will go.
      Big Game Animation 3_instruction: |
        The update-danger function should work just
        like update-target, except that the danger should move from the right side
        over towards the left. Complete update-danger to make the danger fly across
        the screen.
      Big Game Animation 4_instruction: |
        At this point in your game, your danger
        should run across the screen from right to left, and your target should run
        across from left to right. They don't ever come back on screen once they've
        left, but we'll take care of that later. Take a minute to make sure your
        game is working like you want it to, and then click "Finish" to move on.
      Big Game Booleans 1_instruction: |
        When you last worked on your game we got
        our target and danger sprites to fly across the screen, but they never come
        back. Click "Run" to see how your game is currently working, and then click
        finish and we'll work on making those sprites reappear on screen after they've
        left.
      Big Game Booleans 2_instruction: |
        Go to the Functions section of the toolbox
        and complete the safe-left? function so that it returns true if the sprite's
        x coordinate is greater than -50. If you're successful you should see the
        Danger go off the left side and then return on the right side.
      Big Game Booleans 3_instruction: |
        Now that you've got safe-left?, let's fill
        in safe-right? - it should take in a sprite's x coordinate and return true
        if that coordinate is less than 450. Once your safe-right? is complete you
        should see the Target go off the right side of the screen and return on the
        left.
      Big Game Booleans 4_instruction: |
        Complete the onscreen? function so that it
        checks whether both safe-left? and safe-right? are true.
      Big Game Booleans 5_instruction: |
        At this point your Danger should run across
        the screen from right to left, your Target should run across from left to
        right, and they should both return to the opposite side, repeatedly. Take
        a minute to make sure your game is working like you want it to, and then click
        "Finish" to move on.
      Big Game Collision 1 (copy 1)_instruction: |
        When you last worked on your game
        we got our target and danger sprites to fly across the screen, but they never
        come back. Click run to see how your game is currently working, and then click
        finish and we'll work on making those sprites reappear on screen after they've
        left.
      Big Game Collision 1_instruction: |
        At this point you've programmed a video
        game with a moving Target and Danger, both of which return to the screen once
        they've left, and a Player that responds to keyboard input. Click "Run"
        to see how your game is currently working, and then we'll dig into the final
        missing piece - collision detection!
      Big Game Collision 2_instruction: |
        To move the player up and down, we'll need
        to use a conditional block to figure out which key is pressed and respond
        accordingly. Computers read keypresses as numeric key codes - the up arrow
        is 38 and the down arrow is 40. You can lookup other key codes in your student
        workbook. Edit the 'update-player' function so that if moves the player
        up when the up arrow is pressed, or down when the down arrow is pressed.
      Big Game Collision 3_instruction: |
        Use the Distance Formula, so the distance
        function returns the distance between the player's center coordinates (px,
        py) and another sprite's center coordinates (cx, cy).
      Big Game Collision 4_instruction: |
        Complete the collide? function so that it
        returns true if the distance between two points is less than 100 pixels apart.

        Danger return to the screen once they've left. Click Run to see how your
        game looks right now, and then we'll get to making your Player move up and
        down.
      Big Game Player 2_instruction: |
        Edit the update-player function so the player
        moves up when the up arrow (keycode 38) is pressed, and moves down (keycode

        你能想出怎么画这个图形吗？提示：创建一个能画6条边的函数，并取名为“六边形”函数。
        
      Course 4 Artist Params 9_instruction: 还记得当我们用计数循环，但删除了里面的一个循环了吗？让我们做点有意思的，用有“边数”和“长度”参数的“画一个形状”的函数。你能重新创建这些形状吗？这些正方形计数应该是5/100/5，三角形的计数应该是10/100/10，六边形是2/100/2。
      Course 4 Artist Var 9_instruction: 这里是一个画三角形的算法，将他改成用“边数”变量。将数字3用“边数”变量替换掉。提示：记得用“设置边数为”模块。

      Course 4 Artist Vars 10_instruction: 这里有个算法能在一个小一点的三角形外面再画一个三角形。你能将它改成用“边数”变量来画出每个三角形吗？浏览一下代码，每次看到数字3，就将它换成“边数”变量。记得使用“设置边数”模块。
      Course 4 Artist Vars 11_instruction: 这里有一些更复杂的代码，它也使用了一些上一关的概念 —— 你需要将“边数”变量设置成什么来画出这里的正方形？
      Course 4 Artist Vars 12_instruction: 让我们将“边数”变量设置为5. 我们会加更多的边到这个算法中，边数越大，就越能明白整个模式！注意，这里有另一个叫做长度的变量。我们能在任何“向前移动”模块中使用它，并且将长度变量设置为75。
      Course 4 Artist Vars 13_instruction: "当一个图形有很多条边时，为了让它能显示在屏幕中，要让每条边都短一些。\n\r\n让我们重新创建这个算法来得到这个神奇的模式，但是为了不手动输入“长度”变量，让我们将“边数”变量放到一个“数学”模块中，来确保每个图形都能放下。每个多边形的边界都是300像素。\r\n需要提示吗？点击这里。"
      Course 4 Artist Vars 14_instruction: "自由发挥！现在你的算法嵌套到了又一个循环中。试着改变这两个变量的值来画出很酷的图形。\r\n\r\n如果想看到更好的效果，试试使用颜色模块！在循环里面使用随机颜色，看看效果如何。"
      Course 4 Artist Vars 2_instruction: 改进“向前移动150像素”，让移动模块使用一个叫做“长度”的变量。你能将长度设置为150来重新画这个三角形吗？

      Course 4 Artist Vars 8_instruction: 自由发挥：尝试改变这个图形的边数。你能改变算法，不管边数是多少，都让这个图形的大小基本不变吗？提示：如果你用长度除以边数，这样当边数变多的时候，每条边长会变短。
      Course 4 Artist Vars 9_instruction: 修改这个算法，让它能用边数变量，而不是一个固定的数字来画出这个三角形。别忘了用“设置边数为”模块。

      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 4_instruction: 现在，我们用一个叫做“高度”的变量来控制小狗能跳多高。修改“高度”变量，让小狗能跳足够高，得到所有旗帜。
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 5_instruction: '让我们编写一个游戏！首先我们需要一个分数。重新构造代码来做出像上一关的分数，并且设置为10分。 '
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 6 (copy 1)_instruction: '酷，现在我们已经有了分数变量了，但我们怎么能让它有用呢？如果每次用火球击中敌人就加分如何？使用"当演员2碰到任何东西"事件，这样当火球碰到小猫时，就会触发分数的更新。你可以通过设置分数=分数+1来增加分数。到达10分（一次得一分！）就能通过这关。'
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 6_instruction: "用右方向键来发射桃心。\r\n\r\n在游戏中，怎么才能得分呢？每次小狗用桃心击中小猫时，往“points”（分数）变量上加1。用“当演员2碰到任何东西”来触发分数的更新。通过使用\"points = points + 1\"来增加分数。将分数增加到10分（每次加1分！）来通过这一关。"
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 7_instruction: 很好，让我们把这个游戏变得不是太简单。任何时候，小狗（演员1）被小猫（演员2）的黄色桃心集中时，就丢失1分。让我们从10分开始，这样就不会太难了。让你的分数从10减到0来通过这一关。
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 8 (copy 1)_instruction: 好吧，这个游戏的最后一件事 —— 让我们调整它能让玩家赢或者输。用一个无限循环来检查分数的值，如果分数大于20，让敌人消失。如果分数小于0，让玩家消失。当游戏和你想的一样时，点击“完成”。
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 8_instruction: 让我们改一下游戏，能让小狗赢或者输。用一个无限循环来检查分数的值，如果分数大于20，让敌人（小猫）消失。如果分数小于0，让玩家（小狗）消失。当游戏和你想的一样时，点击“完成”。

      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 3_instruction: 如果我们数大一点的数，也能在相同次数内完成它。试着让小狗从10数到1000，每次增加10。
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 4_instruction: 改变每次增加的值会有帮助，但我们一直是线性计数（每次改变的数量都和上次一样）。如果我想用指数计数呢？不用改变计数循环的设置，你能按照1，4，9，16，25... 计数吗（按照平方计数）？
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 4a_instruction: "现在，让我们将一些第7关中的变量和“计数器”变量混合起来制造一些神奇的变化。\r\n\r\n在这一关中，小狗通过“increment”（增加）来从0到1000计数。在代码最开始处，将“increment”设置为10，看看会发生什么。"
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 5_instruction: 在上一关中，我们按照每个数的平方计数了。试试将“counter ^ 2”（计数器的2次方）改为“counter ^ 3”（计数器的3次方）来按照每个数的立方来计数。（1，8，27，64，125，216，343...）
      Course 4 Play Labs For Loops 5a_instruction: "In this puzzle, Dog will be your\ntime keeper.\r\n\r\nDog will count from 0 to 30 by \"increment\".

        Here's an Evaluation Block called AND - it returns
        true if both of its parameters are true, otherwise it returns false. Edit
        the x variable so that this expression returns true.
      Eval Booleans 5_instruction: |
        This OR block returns true if either of its parameters
        is true. Otherwise, if both parameters are false it will return false. Set
        the y variable to a value that will cause this expression to return false.
      Eval Booleans 6_instruction: |
        Here's one more boolean block called NOT. This
        block flips true to false, or false to true. If you wrap this block of code
        in a NOT block, it should return true (because we are asking if the two expressions
        do NOT produce equal values).
      Eval Booleans Free Play_instruction: |
        Free Play: Try out some creations of
        your own using Booleans.

        returning "true" if the are equal, or "false" if they are not. What do
        you think this code will evaluate to?
      Eval Cond 1_instruction: |
        The cond block checks the boolean expressions in
        the left column, and as soon as it finds one that returns "true" it runs
        the corresponding code on the right. If none of the expressions evaluate to
        "true," it runs the bottom block. Update the "temperature" variable so
        that this block returns "It's just right."
      Eval Cond 2 (copy 1)_instruction: |
        This condition returns a different shape
        based on the value of the "sides" variable - change the value of "sides"
        so that the conditional returns a triangle.
      Eval Cond 2_instruction: |
        This condition returns a different shape based on
        the value of the "sides" variable - change the value of "sides" so that
        the conditional returns a triangle.
      Eval Cond 3 (copy 1)_instruction: |
        Can you write a conditional that checks
        the variable "age" and returns "Old enough to vote and drive" if age >
        17, "Old enough to drive" if age is > 15, and "Can't drive or vote" if
        neither conditions is true. Hint: The first condition to return "true" wins
        - make sure you put your conditions in the right order.
      Eval Cond 3_instruction: |
        Can you write a conditional that checks the variable
        "age" and returns "Old enough to vote and drive" if age > 17, "Old enough
        to drive" if age is > 15, and "Can't drive or vote" if neither conditions
        is true. Hint: The first condition to return "true" wins - make sure you
        put your conditions in the right order.
      Eval Cond 4_instruction: |
        We can use the string=? function to make conditionals
        that respond to text input. Here's a function called green shape that takes
        a string for the type of shape. Complete the conditions so that the correct
        solid green shape is returned when the function is run with "circle", "triangle",
        "square", or "rectangle".
      Eval Cond 5_instruction: |
        Here's a similar function red shape with an additional
        variable for size. Complete the conditionals so the correct solid red image
        of a given size is drawn for "circle", "triangle", and "star".

        We're going to write a function
        that draws a solid rectangle of any color that is twice wide as it is high.
        Start with an example - draw a solid green rectangle that has a height on
        100 pixels.
      Eval Design Recipe 1_instruction: |
        Alright, now given the Contract wide-rect:
        Number String -> Image, write an example - draw a solid green rectangle that

      Eval Design Recipe 2 (copy 1)_instruction: |
        Let's do one more example before
        writing the function definition - this time draw a solid red rectangle with
        a height of 75 pixels.
      Eval Design Recipe 2_instruction: |
        Let's do one more example before writing
        the function definition - this time draw a solid red rectangle with a height
        of 75 pixels.
      Eval Design Recipe 3_instruction: |
        The Design Recipe for wide-rect already
        has a contract and one example. Can you write a second example and then complete
        the definition? The wide-rect function should produce a rectangle of given
        color that is twice as wide as it is high.

        behind each cloud!
      grade3_bee_conditionals_quantum4_instruction: |
        Sometimes this cloud covers
        a flower, and sometimes it covers a honeycomb! Use the if/else block to collect
        nectar if it is a flower, else to make honey (because it is a honeycomb).

      grade3_playLab_buildGame_1_instruction: |
        There is a new block in this lesson,
        the `random integer` block. It is used to choose a random number. Write a
        program where the robot says a random number between 1 and 100!
      grade3_playLab_buildGame_2_instruction: |
        We have already created a random integer,
        "j", which is either 1 or 0. Now, we need to use it to decide whether our
        card is red or black. Add a second if statement to the code under `when run`
        to complete this code.
      grade3_playLab_buildGame_3_instruction: |
        There are 13 different card values
        in a deck of cards, so we'll need to have 13 options. Under the empty `when
        run` block, add a line that sets the placeholder "i" to a random integer
        between 1 and 13.
      grade3_playLab_buildGame_4_instruction: |
        In a deck of cards, a card with value
        1 isn't actually called a "1", there's a special name. Write an if statement
        that checks if the random number is a 1, then tell the computer that the value
        of that card is "Ace".
      grade3_playLab_buildGame_5_instruction: |
        We can just call the cards from 2
        to 10 by their numbers, so add an if statement that checks whether the number
        generated is within those numbers, then sets the card value to the number
        generated.
      grade3_playLab_buildGame_6_instruction: |
        There are three more cards with special
        names in the deck. Add to your code so that a card number 11 is called a "Jack",
        a 12 is a "Queen" and a 13 is a "King"
      grade3_playLab_buildGame_7_instruction: |
        You already know what color your card
        is, but what suit is it? Add code to the conditional statement "if card is
        Red" to choose hearts or diamonds.
      grade3_playLab_buildGame_8_instruction: |
        Add the second part of the code to
        choose a suit, copying what you made for a Red card.

      grade3_robotFarmer_ConditionalsIntro_6_instruction: |
        Remove all the piles of
        dirt, using as few blocks as possible. The new options in the dropdown menu
        on the "while" block tell me if I'm standing on a pile or a hole.
      grade3_robotFarmer_ConditionalsIntro_7_instruction: |
        Wow, I found a really
        deep hole! I don't know how many shovelfuls of dirt it needs. Can you write
        a program that fills it until the ground is even?
      grade3_robotFarmer_ConditionalsIntro_8_instruction: |
        Help me fill in the hole
        at the end of the field, using as few blocks as possible.
      grade3_robotFarmer_ConditionalsIntro_9_instruction: |
        Make me remove all these
        piles of dirt. Try to use as few blocks as possible. Hint: try using a "while"
        block.
      grade3_robotFarmer_ConditionalsIntro_TeacherIDo1_instruction: |

        I'm working
        late, so it's dark out, and I can't tell how large the piles are. Now I
        don't have all the options I used to have on the while block. Move me along
        the field, and if there is a pile, remove it
      grade3_RunningFarm_1_instruction: "(Notes for Review) Since the last stage\ntaught the 'repeat until' block, the purpose of this is most likely to teach\nthe 'repeat while' block. In the context of the levels already created,\nI think using the 'repeat' and 'if' blocks could be possible,  (ex. if\nthe crops weren't spread as evenly on the field so the farmer would have\nto test for wheat present before collecting it). A Repeat While block would\nbe more applicable if there were multiple wheat/potatoes in each square, which\nmight be a possible change.\r\n\r\nGrant Notes: for the coins, 1=0 and 2=1\n(I couldn't get the coins to show up with a value of 0). The wheat should\ngrow at random intervals. For the graphic, think about the Minecraft way of\ngrowing wheat (green, has multiple heights showing growth, then yellow for\nripe)."
      grade3_RunningFarm_10_instruction: |
        This is another debugging to make sure
        the students understand the difference between the IF block and While loop.
        Start off all crops as ripe with at least 1 item, with growth after Run.
      grade3_RunningFarm_2_instruction: "NOTES: have wheat and potatoes interspersed\nthroughout the row. Potatoes should be fully grown, with some randomly showing\nmore than 1 potato per spot. This is different from the previous puzzle because\nstudents will have to use the drop down menu on the IF block to select potatoes\ninstead of harvesting wheat.\r\n\r\n"
      grade3_RunningFarm_3_instruction: |
        This will look essentially the same as the
        previous puzzle. There should be two crops randomly planted in the row. Each
        plant should start at a random growth stage and grow when the user runs their
        algorithm. Students are using the while loop and hopefully understand that
        it's better at picking all the crops of one type.
      grade3_RunningFarm_4_instruction: |
        Since students started this course using
        events, we wanted to include them into this culminating stage. We will only
        use them in a few stages then move on. This puzzle should randomly populate
        the entire column with wheat and potatoes. The puzzle should also start with
        the following event blocks: up arrow, down arrow, and space bar. Attached
        to the space bar should be a collect block.
      grade3_RunningFarm_5_instruction: |
        This puzzle should randomly populate the
        entire row with wheat and potatoes. The puzzle should also start with the

        to make sure students are using while loop?
      grade3_RunningFarm_6_instruction: |
        This puzzle should randomly populate the
        entire field with wheat and potatoes. The puzzle should also start with the

        space bar. Can we check to make sure students are using while loop?
      grade3_RunningFarm_7_instruction: |
        Have wheat and potatoes planted randomly

        to transition away from events
      grade3_RunningFarm_8_instruction: |
        Have wheat and potatoes planted randomly
        at various growth stages. Now we introduce multiple while loops (stacked)
        nested inside a loop. The two while loops in the solution represent different
        while loops (while there is potato and while there is wheat)
      grade3_RunningFarm_9_instruction: |
        Add Weeds element. Weeds start out in random
        spots in the field and spread more and more rapidly as time goes on.. This
        puzzle is the culminating game-like puzzle. Students should have the event
        blocks (up, down, left, right, spacebar) available in the toolbox to use if
        they want. The entire field should be planted randomly with mostly wheat,
        potatoes, and a few weeds.

        It's free play time! Have fun with all
        the blocks in your tool box. 
      grade5_playlab_parameters_points1_instruction: "Here's the same game but most\nof the code is hidden. We've added a new function called `score_points.`\r\n\r\nAdd\na new parameter called `points` to the `player_score` function. \r\n\r\nThe\n`score_points` function should be able to both add and remove points from\n`player_score` depending on which actor is hit.\r\nChanging the score by 1\nwill add a point, while changing the score by -1 will subtract a point.\r\n\r\nWhen\nyou're done, click \"Run\" to play.  When Dog scores 6 points, you will move\non to the next puzzle. "
      grade5_playlab_variables1_instruction: |
        This time you don't have to write
        any code, just hit "Run" to play the game! In this game, you're the dog
        who is trying to collect more flags than the cat. Use the down arrow to control
        the dog. Press "Finish" when you're done playing.
      grade5_playlab_variables10_instruction: 编辑“巡逻”函数来添加一个“演员”参数，由此调用它时，能让屏幕上每个演员都动起来。记住，演员对应到数字1和2，3上。
      grade5_playlab_variables11_instruction: 添加另一个叫做“速度”的参数到“巡逻”函数里。试着在“设置速度”模块中使用新的“速度”参数，来帮助企鹅在别的小动物之前得到所有旗帜。
      grade5_playlab_variables12_instruction: "来点好玩的！看看这里的代码，是否你能明白每个模块都做了什么。\r\n\r\n看完以后，用方向键来让小狗收集到所有旗帜。"
      grade5_playlab_variables13_instruction: 只有在小狗碰到别的任何一个演员时，用“当演员碰到”模块来把小狗送回左上角。
      grade5_playlab_variables14_instruction: |
        It's free play time! Have fun with
        all the blocks in your tool box. 
      grade5_playlab_variables1ask_instruction: "This time, when you press 'run',\nyou will see a 'prompt' asking you for a number. This number will be stored\nin a variable used to set the dog's speed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPay attention to how\nthis program is written!"
      grade5_playlab_variables2_instruction: 上次关卡的比赛不是很公平！改变“dog_speed”（小狗速度）变量来让你能比小猫收集到更多的旗帜。最先收集到10个旗帜的就算赢！
      grade5_playlab_variables3_instruction: 这里有种新的游戏！用左右方向键来移动，上方向键跳跃。看看你能否收集到所有的旗帜。
      grade5_playlab_variables4_instruction: |
        Now we're using a variable called
        "height" to control how high the dog can jump. Update the "height" variable
        so that the dog can jump high enough to reach all the flags.
      grade5_playlab_variables5_instruction: "You've seen now how a variable can\nbe used to set the height of an actor's jump. How else could  you use a variable?\r\n\r\nLet's\nbuild a game! First we'll need a score. Try setting the 'points' variable\nto give yourself 10 free points!"
      grade5_playlab_variables6_instruction: "用右方向键来发射桃心。\r\n\r\n在游戏中，怎么才能得分呢？每次小狗用桃心击中小猫时，往“points”（分数）变量上加1。用“当演员2碰到任何东西”来触发分数的更新。通过使用\"points = points + 1\"来增加分数。将分数增加到10分（每次加1分！）来通过这一关。"
      grade5_playlab_variables6ask_instruction: "This time, you need 100 points to\nwin!  Don't worry though, you can choose how many points you earn each time\nyou score a hit!\r\nTry adding the `ask` block and changing the number 1 out\nfor the variable `value`."
      grade5_playlab_variables7_instruction: 很好，让我们把这个游戏变得不是太简单。任何时候，小狗（演员1）被小猫（演员2）的黄色桃心集中时，就丢失1分。让我们从10分开始，这样就不会太难了。让你的分数从10减到0来通过这一关。
      grade5_playlab_variables71_instruction: "这是一个早先的游戏，但是大部分代码都隐藏了。这里有个新函数叫做“score_points”（得分）。\r\n\r\n编辑这个函数，使得“points”（分数）参数能加到“player_score”（玩家分数）变量上。\r\n\r\n“player_score”（玩家分数）变量会在每次小狗的桃心碰到小猫时增加，在小猫的桃心碰到小狗时减少。\r\n\r\n注意：当你完成后，点击“运行”来玩。当小狗得到6分时，就可以进入下一关。 "
      grade5_playlab_variables81_instruction: "我们已经为你添加了上一关的函数。\r\n\r\n用“如果”模块来编写你的游戏，当play_score(玩家分数) 大于某个值时，调用level_up(升级) 函数。\r\n\r\n例如：“play_score” > 6\r\n\r\n玩游戏，并且达到第4级来到达下一关。 "
      grade5_playlab_variables9_instruction: 这里有个函数叫做“巡逻”。编辑它来让猫向上移动400像素，再向下移动400像素。
      grade5_playlab_variables_freeplay_instruction: "Free Play time! Here are all\nof the variables we've played with so far in this stage, as well as a few\nmore in case you want them. \r\n\r\nNotice that there are now so many blocks\nin our toolbox that they need to be organized!

      PDAlg Updates Cond_instruction: |
        When you went to PD in the summer, the Conditional
        block that you were introduced to was black and allowed any data type to be
        used. This proved to be confusing, given that every other function we've
        seen always produces the same type of data. To help make conditionals clearer
        and more consistent we've replaced the single black block with a separate
        block for each data type.
      PDAlg Updates Errors_instruction: |
        Run the provided program and use the error
        messages to try and track down the bugs.
      PDAlg Updates Space_instruction: |
        Making use of limited programming space (especially
        on small screens) is challenging with a block based language. To help with

        Requirements: The icon
        must be 16x16 pixels. You must use the Pixelation Widget to encode the bits
        of color information. The image must be encoded with at least 12 bits per
        pixel.
      Pixelation - Lesson 15 - Color Shades 4x4_instruction: |
        We start you out with
        the 4x4 image Maddie created in the video. Your task is to fill a 4x4 grid
        with colors using 12-bits per pixel. Here are the requirements: Row 1 - fill
        with shades of red. Row 2 - shades of green. Row 3 - shades of blue. Row 4
        - shades of gray.
      Pixelation - Lesson 15 - Color Shades_instruction: |
        We start you out with the
        row of shades of red that Maddie created in the video. Experiment with 6-bit

      Pixelation Bee_instruction: |
        This larger image of a bee encodes color with
        12 bits per pixel, but viewing in hex makes it easier to see the color of
        each pixel. If you switch to binary mode - hold on to your hat - it's a lot
        of bits. Here's another mind-blowing thing to try: slide the bits per pixel
        up to 24 bits per pixel. What happens? Can you explain this behavior?
      Pixelation Flappy_instruction: |
        Here is a bigger image at 9 bits per pixel.
        With 9 bits per pixel you can express 512 different colors. Click through
        to see the next image which is even more sophisticated, but easier to understand.

      Sam the Butterfly 1 (copy 1)_instruction: |
        This butterfly is named Sam, and
        the game area is Sam’s yard. Sam's yard is 400 pixels wide by 400 pixels
        tall! As you can see, Sam is free to walk around the yard, and the coordinates
        at the top of the screen update to tell you his location. Use the arrow keys
        to move sam around his yard. Help Sam collect all of the flags to move on.
      Sam the Butterfly 1_instruction: |
        This bat is named Sam, and the game area
        is Sam’s yard. Sam's yard is 400 pixels wide by 400 pixels tall! As you can
        see, Sam is free to walk around the yard, and the coordinates at the top of
        the screen update to tell you his location. Click "Run" and then use the
        arrow keys to move Sam around his yard, making note of Sam's coordinates

      Sam the Butterfly 2_instruction: |
        Sam's mom wants to make sure that she can
        always see at least a bit of him, so lets write some functions that help make
        sure he doesn't go too far out of the yard. Here's a function called safe-left?
        - it should take a Number for its domain that represents Sam's x-coordinates
        and return true if he's completely visible on screen. If your function works,
        Sam shouldn't be able to leave the yard from the left side.
      Sam the Butterfly 3_instruction: |
        In the last puzzle we kept Sam from leaving
        on the left, now let's do the same thing on the right. Complete the safe-right?

        "on-screen?" function. Update the function so that it checks that "safe-left?"
        AND "safe-right?" AND "safe-up?" are all true. When you've fixed the
        function, try going out of the yard from the left, right, and top sides.
      Sam the Butterfly 7_instruction: |
