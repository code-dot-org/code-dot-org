# Dasturlash soati tadbiriga ommaviy axborot vositalarini qanday jalb qilish mumkin

### “Dasturlash soati” tadbiringiz bilan diqqatni jalb qiling va maktabingizda kompyuter fanlari nima uchun muhimligini ko'rsatish uchun mahalliy ommaviy axborot vositalarini taklif qiling.

*Matbuot va ommaviy axborot vositalariga oid barcha savollar uchun <press@code.org> bilan bog‘laning.*

* * *

## Asosiy maslahatlar

- Tadbiringizdan ikki hafta oldin elektron pochta orqali ommaviy axborot vositalari bilan bog'laning. Agar dastlabki javobni olmasangiz, elektron pochta va telefon orqali murojaat qiling.
- Maktab xodimi yoki ko'ngillidan Internetda baham ko'rish yoki matbuotga yuborish uchun suratga olishini so'rang.
- Dasturlash soati haqida veb-saytingizning bosh sahifasida va maktab gazetangizda maqola yozing. Tadbir tafsilotlarini va o'quvchilar faoliyatining rasmlarini joylashtiring.
- Facebook va Twitter’da rejalaringiz haqidagi yangiliklarni baham ko‘ring, tadbirlaringizni e’lon qiling va {{ campaign_date/year }} davomidagi rasmlarni joylang. Code.org tadbirlaringizni koʻrishi va targʻib qila olishi uchun **#HourOfCode** xeshtegidan foydalaning.

## Bosqichma-bosqich yo'riqnoma

### 1. Tadbiringizni rejalashtiring

- Dasturlash soatini boshlash uchun yig'ilishni rejalashtiring.
- Ota-onalarga [maktub]({{ promote/sample_emails }}) yuboring va ulardan ushbu xabarni tarqatishlarini so‘rang.
- Mahalliy hokim, Kongress aʼzosi, gubernator yoki nufuzli tadbirkorni o'quvchilaringiz bilan suhbatlashishga taklif qilish uchun [xat]({{ promote/sample_emails }}) yuboring.
- Guruh faoliyatlarini tashkil qiling (masalan, “kompyutersiz (oflayn) dasturlash faoliyatini namoyish qilish) yoki o'quvchilar tomonidan yaratilgan va boshqariladigan faoliyatni namoyish qiling.
- Code.org-ning [Dasturlash soati videosini]({{ urls/home }}) yoki [ushbu videolardan]({{ promote/videos }}) birini o'quvchilarni ilhomlantirish uchun ko‘rsating. <br />

### 2. Ta'lim yoki mahalliy voqealarni yorituvchi maxsus muxbirlarni aniqlang

Mahalliy gazetalar, telekanallar yoki radiostansiyalar yoki bloglar kabi.<br />

### 3. Mahalliy ommaviy axborot vositalari bilan bog'laning

Elektron pochta orqali bog'lanish eng yaxshi usul. U qisqa bo'lishi kerakmi va "nega boshqa odamlar bu tadbirga ahamiyat ko'rsatishi kerak" degan savolni qo'yichi kerak? Tadbirda kimlar bo'lishi haqida aloqa ma'lumotlarini (shu jumladan mobil telefon raqamini) ham qo'shing. **[OAV uchun taklif namunasini ko‘rish]({{promoting/press-kit-emails }})**.

Muxbirning aloqa uchun ma'lumotlarini topish uchun veb -saytdan qidiring. If you can't find it, call the publication to ask, or email the organization's general email address and ask for your message to be directed to the correct reporter. <br />

### 4. Prepare to field questions about your school event. Here are some examples:

#### Why is your school doing an Hour of Code?

While all of us know that it’s important for students to learn how to navigate today’s tech-saturated world, many teachers aren’t experienced in computer science and don’t know where to start. This event is a chance for all of us to see what computer science is about.

We hope it’ll spark interest in students to keep learning. Research also shows that kids can pick up programming concepts before they know how to read and write. In fact, their brains are more receptive to computer languages at a young age, just like foreign languages. <br /> <br />

#### Bu nima uchun muhim?

Technology is transforming every industry on the planet. In 2015, 7 million openings in the U.S. were in occupations—including art and design—that value coding skills. But 60 percent of schools in the U.S. don't teach computer science. It’s time for us to catch up to the 21st-century. We know that regardless of what our students do when they grow up, whether they go into medicine, business, politics, or the arts, knowing how to build technology will give them confidence and a competitive edge. <br />

## Sample email to send to invite local media to your event

**Subject line**: Local school joins mission to introduce students to computer science

Computers are everywhere, changing every industry on the planet, but fewer than half of all schools teach computer science. Young women and students from marginalized racial and ethnic groups are severely underrepresented in computer science classes, and in the tech industry. Good news is, we’re on our way to change this.

With the Hour of Code, computer science has been on homepages of Google, MSN, Yahoo!, and Disney. Over 100 partners have joined together to support this movement. Every Apple Store in the world has hosted an Hour of Code. Even President Obama wrote his first line of code as part of the campaign.

That’s why every one of the [X number] students at [SCHOOL NAME] are joining in on the largest learning event in history: The Hour of Code, during Computer Science Education Week (December 3-9).

I'm writing to invite you to attend our kickoff assembly and to see kids start the activity on [DATE].

The Hour of Code, organized by the nonprofit Code.org and over 100 others, is a global movement that believes the students of today are ready to learn critical skills for 21st-century success. Please join us.

Contact: [YOUR NAME], [TITLE], cell: (212) 555-5555 When: [DATE and TIME of your event] Where: [ADDRESS and DIRECTIONS]

I look forward to being in touch. <br />

## Additional details and a quote you can use in materials

"The Hour of Code is designed to demystify code and show that computer science is not rocket science—anybody can learn the basics," said Hadi Partovi, founder and CEO of Code.org. "Over 100 million students worldwide have tried an Hour of Code. The demand for relevant 21st-century computer science education crosses all borders and knows no boundaries." <br /> <br />
