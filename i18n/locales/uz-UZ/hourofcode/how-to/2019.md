# Dasturlash soatini qanday rejalashtirish kerak

### Harakatga qo'shiling va ushbu bosqichlar bilan bir guruh talabalarni kompyuter fanining birinchi soati bilan tanishtiring. Kod yozish soatini o‘tkazish juda oson – hatto yangi o‘rganayotganlar uchun ham! Agar yordam berish uchun qo'shimcha qo'llar to'plamini xohlasangiz, o'zingizning sinfingizda Dasturlash soatini boshqarishda yordam beradigan [mahalliy ko'ngillini]({{ urls/volunteer_local }}) topishingiz mumkin.

### Agar savollaringiz bo‘lsa, [Ishtirok etish to‘g‘risidagi yo‘riqnomamizni]({{ localized_files/participation_guide }}) ko‘rib chiqing.

## 1. Ushbu video-qo'llanmani tomosha qiling <iframe width="500" height="255" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/SrnvvWDm73k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen mark="crwd-mark"></iframe>

## 2. Mashg'ulot va qo'llanmalarni o'rganing

We provide a variety of fun, [student-guided tutorials]({{ urls/learn }}) for all age groups and experience levels. It’s popular for students to try self-led tutorials, though many activities include lesson plans for teachers to guide discussion or extend the activity as well.

Faoliyat bilan tanishib chiqing va agar siz barcha o‘quvchilaringiz uchun bitta o‘quv qo‘llanma tanlashni xohlasangiz yoki har bir bolaga o‘z xohishiga ko‘ra tanlasangiz, qaror qabul qiling.

## 3. Create your Plan for the Day

### Texnologiyalarga bo‘lgan ehtiyojlaringiz haqida o‘ylab ko‘ring - kompyuterlar ixtiyoriy!

- The best Hour of Code experience includes Internet-connected computers. But you don’t need a computer for every child, and you can even do the Hour of Code without a computer at all! For [unplugged activities](/learn), simply filter the Classroom Technology section to show options for “No computers or devices”.
- Make sure to test tutorials on student computers or devices to ensure they work properly on browsers with sound and video. Have low bandwidth? Plan to show videos at the front of the class, so each student isn't downloading their own videos. Or try the offline tutorials.
- Agar siz tanlagan o‘quv qo‘llanma ovoz bilan yaxshi ishlasa, sinfingiz uchun naushnik bilan ta'minlang yoki talabalardan o‘zlari olib kelishini so‘rang.
- Don't have enough devices? Use [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q). When students partner up, they help each other and rely less on the teacher. They’ll also see that computer science is social and collaborative.

### Kun va vaqtni tanlang

People around the world join in the Hour of Code celebration during CS Education Week (December 9-13) when the latest tutorials and activities are released. But you can do an Hour of Code any day of the year!

## 4. "Kod soati"ngizni targ‘ib qiling

Endi tadbiringizni rejalashtirganingizdan so‘ng, uni targ‘ib qilishni boshlash vaqti keldi!

### Maktabingiz va jamoangizga ayting

Promote the Hour of Code to other teachers who may want to join in on the fun! This is also a great opportunity to reach out to your school’s PTSA or share in parent newsletters, letting them know their children may come home wanting to try more activities and tutorials!

### Tadbiringizni ro‘yxatdan o‘tkazish orqali ko‘ngillilarga xabar bering

When you [sign-up your Hour of Code event](/), you’ll receive helpful email communications with news and tips for hosting a successful Hour of Code. It’s also how you can let local volunteers know your school is participating. Volunteers are a great resource and can come speak to your class about computer science or simply help your students with Hour of Code activities.

### Talabalaringizni hayajonga soling

Lead up to the event by sharing [inspirational videos](/promote/resources) highlighting diverse people and creative ways that computer science can be used. Or order inspirational posters for your classroom! Students are more excited to participate in a subject when they see people who look like them encouraging it.

{{ promote_new_posters }}

Afishalar, videolar, stikerlar va \[tadbiringizni targ‘ib qilish]\](/promote/resources#posters) jamoangizga yetkazishning boshqa usullari haqida ko‘proq bilib oling.

## 5. Start your Hour of Code Strong

Kodlar soati tantanasi kelgandan so‘ng, ushbu vositalar va tavsiyalardan ba'zilari bilan tadbiringizni kuchli boshlaganingizga ishonch hosil qiling.

Invite a [local volunteer]({{ urls/volunteer_local }}) to inspire your students by talking about the breadth of possibilities in computer science. There are thousands of volunteers around the world ready to help with your Hour of Code through either a classroom visit or video chat with your students!

Ilhomlantiruvchi videoni ko‘rsating:

- The original Code.org launch video, featuring Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and NBA star Chris Bosh. (There are [1 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYZF6oIZtfc), [5 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc), and [9 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1xS07N-FA) versions available)
- Find more inspirational [resources]({{ urls/inspire }}) and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNfpD8i4Sx7U0y2MccnrNZuP).

It’s okay if both you and your students are brand new to computer science. Here are some ideas to introduce your Hour of Code activity:

- Texnologiyalar hayotimizga ta'sir qilish usullarini tushuntiring, o‘g‘il bolalar va qizlar g‘amxo‘rlik qiladigan misollar bilan (hayotni saqlab qolish, odamlarga yordam berish, odamlarni bog‘lash va hk).
- Sinf sifatida kundalik hayotda koddan foydalanadigan narsalarni sanab o‘ting.
- See tips for getting girls interested in computer science [here]({{ urls/girls }}).


## 6. Get Coding!

Talabalarni faoliyatga yo‘naltiring

- Write the tutorial link on a whiteboard. Find the link listed on the [information for your selected tutorial]({{ urls/learn }}) under the number of participants.

O‘quvchilaringiz qiyinchiliklarga duch kelganda, javob berish yaxshidir:

- “I don’t know. Let’s figure this out together.”
- "Texnologiya har doim ham biz xohlagan tarzda ishlamaydi."
- “Learning to program is like learning a new language; you won’t be fluent right away.”

Agar talaba erta tugatsa nima bo‘ladi?

- Talabalar barcha o‘quv qo‘llanmalarini ko‘rishlari mumkin va [yana bir soatlik kodni sinab ko‘ring]({{ urls/learn }}).
- Yoki, ishni tugatgan o‘quvchilardan mashg‘ulotlarda qiynalayotgan sinfdoshlariga yordam berishlarini so‘rang.
