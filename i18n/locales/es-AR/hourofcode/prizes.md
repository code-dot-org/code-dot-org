## Can non-public schools win the video chat prize?

## Can non-US schools win the video chat prize?

No, unfortunately, because of logistics we are unable to offer the video chat prize to schools outside of the U.S. and Canada. All international organizers **are** eligible to receive Dropbox space or Skype credit.

## Why is the $10,000 hardware prize only available to public schools?

We would love to help teachers in public and private schools alike, but at this time, it comes down to logistics. We have partnered with [DonorsChoose.org](http://donorschoose.org) to administer classroom funding prizes, which only works with public, US K-12 schools. According to DonorsChoose.org, the organization is better able to access consistent and accurate data that's available for public schools.

## I’m outside the United States. Can I qualify for prizes?

Due to a small full-time staff, Code.org is unable to handle the logistics of administering international prizes. Because of this people outside the US are unable to qualify for prizes.

To qualify, your entire school must register for the Hour of Code as well as complete the [Hardware Application form](<%= hoc_uri('/prizes') %>) by November 14, 2014.
