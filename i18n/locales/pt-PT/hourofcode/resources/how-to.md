# Como ensinar uma Hour of Code

## 1) Experimenta os tutoriais:

We’ll host a variety of fun, hour-long tutorials for students of all ages, created by a variety of partners. New tutorials are coming to kick off the Hour of Code before December 8-14.

**Todos os turoriais da Hour of Code:**

  * Requerem apenas preparação mínima por parte dos professores
  * Are self-guided - allowing students to work at their own pace and skill-level

## 2) Planeie o hardware de que vai necessitar - os computadores são opcionais

Para proporcionar a melhor experiência da "Hour of Code" convém ter computadores com ligação à internet. No entanto, não é necessário ter um computador por criança e, na verdade, até é possível fazer a "Hour of Code" sem computadores.

  * **Test tutorials on student computers or devices.** Make sure they work properly (with sound and video).
  * **Preview the congrats page** to see what students will see when they finish. 
  * **Provide headphones for your class**, or ask students to bring their own, if the tutorial you choose works best with sound.

## 3) Plan ahead based on your technology available

  * **Don't have enough devices?** Use [pair programming](http://www.ncwit.org/resources/pair-programming-box-power-collaborative-learning). When students partner up, they help each other and rely less on the teacher. They’ll also see that computer science is social and collaborative.
  * **Have low bandwidth?** Plan to show videos at the front of the class, so each student isn't downloading their own videos. Or try the unplugged / offline tutorials.

## 4) Inspire students - show them a video

Show students <% if @country == 'uk' %> [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96B5-JGA9EQ) <% else %> [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC5FbmsH4fw) <% end %> to kick off the Hour of Code. Also check out [these videos](http://youtube.com/codeorg), featuring Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Black Eyed Peas founder will.i.am and NBA star Chris Bosh talking about the importance of programming. (There are [1 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYZF6oIZtfc), [5 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc), and [9 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1xS07N-FA) versions)

**Get your students excited - give them a short intro**

Most kids don’t know what computer science is. Here are some ideas:

  * Explain it in a simple way that includes examples of applications that both boys and girls will care about (saving lives, helping people, connecting people, etc.).
  * Try: "Think about things in your everyday life that use computer science: a cell phone, a microwave, a computer, a traffic light… all of these things needed a computer scientist to help build them.”
  * Or: “Computer science is the art of blending human ideas and digital tools to increase our power. Computer scientists work in so many different areas: writing apps for phones, curing diseases, creating animated movies, working on social media, building robots that explore other planets and so much more."
  * See tips for getting girls interested in computer science [here](http://code.org/girls). 

## 5) Start your Hour of Code

**Direct students to the activity**

  * Write the tutorial link on a whiteboard. Find the link listed on the <% if @country == 'uk' %> [information for your selected tutorial](http://uk.code.org/learn) <% else %> [information for your selected tutorial](http://code.org/learn) <% end %>under the number of participants. (Example: [hourofcode.com/co](http://code.org/learn)) 
  * Tell students to visit the URL and start the tutorial.

**When your students come across difficulties**

  * Tell students, “Ask 3 then me.” Ask 3 classmates, and if they don’t have the answer, then ask the teacher.
  * Encourage students and offer positive reinforcement: “You’re doing great, so keep trying.”
  * It’s okay to respond: “I don’t know. Let’s figure this out together.” If you can’t figure out a problem, use it as a good learning lesson for the class: “Technology doesn’t always work out the way we want. Together, we’re a community of learners.” And: “Learning to program is like learning a new language; you won’t be fluent right away.“

**What to do if a student finishes early?**

  * Students can see all tutorials and try another Hour of Code activity at <% if @country == 'uk' %> [uk.code.org/learn](http://uk.code.org/learn). <% else %> [code.org/learn](http://code.org/learn). <% end %> 
  * Or, ask students who finish early to help classmates who are having trouble with the activity.

**How do I print certificates for my students?**

Each student gets a chance to get a certificate via email when they finish the [Code.org tutorials](http://studio.code.org). You can click on the certificate to print it. However, if you want to make new certificates for your students, visit our <% if @country == 'uk' %> [Certificates](http://uk.code.org/certificates) <% else %> [Certificates](http://code.org/certificates) <% end %> page to print as many certificates as you like, in one fell swoop!

**What comes after the Hour of Code?**

The Hour of Code is just the first step on a journey to learn more about how technology works and how to create software applications. <% if @country == 'uk' %> The Hour of Code is just the first step on a journey to learn more about how technology works and how to create software applications.
