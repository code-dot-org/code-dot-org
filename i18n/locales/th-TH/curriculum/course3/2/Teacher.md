## Lesson Overview

This course is a review of maze concepts from Course 2. Students will help the zombie get to the sunflower using a combination of sequences and loops.

## Lesson Objectives

### Students will:

  * Create a program for a given task using sequential steps
  * Count the number of times an action should be repeated and represent it as a loop
  * Analyze a problem and complete it as efficiently as possible
  * Employ a combination of sequential and looped commands to reach the end of a maze

## Getting Started

### <a name="GetStarted"></a> Introduction

Review with students the basic maze navigation, particularly:

  * Moving forward
  * Turning left/right
  * Looping

## Activity

### <a name="Activity"></a> [Maze](http://learn.code.org/s/course3/stage/2/puzzle/1)

As your students work through the puzzles, observe how they plan the path for the zombie. Identify different strategies used and ask students to share with the whole class. This helps students to recognize that there are many ways to approach these problems. You may want to go through a few puzzles on the projector. While doing this you can ask a one student to trace the path on the screen while another writes the directions on a whiteboard.

## Extended Learning

<a name="Extended"></a>Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### Create Your Own

In small groups, let students design their own mazes and challenge each other to write programs to solve them. For added fun, make life size mazes with students as the zombie and flower.
