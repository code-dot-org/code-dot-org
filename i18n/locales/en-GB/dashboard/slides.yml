#TODO: Wrap numeric keys in quotes & rectify translations on Crowdin.
#Why? Well...
#1) Numeric keys in Yaml are loaded as Fixnums, not strings.
#2) Rails' i18n can only look up string or symbol keys.
#3) Crowdin proofreaders are translating filepaths, despite being hidden.

I'm going to choose the \"turn right\" block and I'll drag it underneath my \"move forward\" block until this orange line appears. Then I'll drop it and the two blocks will snap together. When we press run again, Alex will perform the commands that are stacked from top to bottom in our workspace."

Now we'll click on the repeat block and tell her how many times we want her to perform this action. Now let's build our house before night falls! Have fun!"
