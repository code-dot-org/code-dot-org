        text: "And what if we want to do something after she has moved forward one space? We can add another block to our program. I'm going to choose the \"turn right\" block and I'll drag it underneath my \"move forward\" block until this orange line appears. Then I'll drop it and the two blocks will snap together. When we press run again, Alex will perform the commands that are stacked from top to bottom in our workspace."

        text: "To build a wall of our house, we can either tell Alex to \"move forward\" and place planks four times or we can tell her to \"move forward\" and place one plank, then take this command and use the repeat block to have her perform the action multiple times. Now we'll click on the repeat block and tell her how many times we want her to perform this action. Now let's build our house before night falls! Have fun!"
