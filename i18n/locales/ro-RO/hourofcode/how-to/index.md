# How to plan your Hour of Code

### Join the movement and introduce your students to computer science with these steps.

Computational thinking helps nurture problem-solving skills, logic, and creativity. And technology is transforming every industry on the planet. Students today should learn how to create technology, not just use it. By starting early, they’ll have a foundation for success in any 21st-century career path.

Trying an Hour of Code is a simple and fun way to introduce students to computer science, perhaps for the very first time. Take a look at our [participation guide if you still have questions]({{ localized_files/participation_guide }}).

An Hour of Code can also be held **remotely, online**! To get started, check out our [tips for hosting a virtual Hour of Code event](https://hourofcode.com/us/how-to/virtual).

## 2. Explore activities and tutorials

We provide a variety of fun, [student-guided tutorials]({{ urls/learn }}) for all age groups and experience levels. It’s popular for students to try self-led tutorials, though many activities include lesson plans for teachers to guide discussion or extend the activity as well.

Explore the activities and decide ahead of time if you want to choose a single tutorial for all of your students, or let each child pick their own.

## 3. Create your plan for the day

### Think about your technology needs - computers are optional!

- Cea mai buna experienta Hour of Code include calculatoare care au conexiune la Internet. But you don’t need a computer for every child, and you can even do the Hour of Code without a computer at all! For [unplugged activities](/learn), simply filter the Classroom Technology section to show options for “No computers or devices”.
- Testați neapărat tutorialele pe calculatoarele sau dispozitivele elevilor pentru a vă asigura că funcționează corespunzător pe browsere cu sunet și video. Have low bandwidth? Plan to show videos at the front of the class, so each student isn't downloading their own videos. Or try the offline tutorials.
- Oferiti-le casti elevilor din clasa dvs sau spuneti-le sa isi aduca ei propriile casti daca tutorialul pe care l-ati ales merge mai bine cu sunet.
- Don't have enough devices? Use [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q). Atunci când elevii au un partener, ei se ajută reciproc şi se bazează mai puţin pe profesor. Ei vor vedea, de asemenea, că programarea este socială şi colaborativă.

### Pick a day and time

People around the world join in the Hour of Code celebration during CS Education Week (December 9-13) when the latest tutorials and activities are released. But you can do an Hour of Code any day of the year!

## 4. Promote your Hour of Code

Now that you've planned your event, it's time to start promoting it!

### Tell your School and Community

Promote the Hour of Code to other teachers who may want to join in on the fun! This is also a great opportunity to reach out to your school’s PTSA or share in parent newsletters, letting them know their children may come home wanting to try more activities and tutorials!

### Let Volunteers Know by Registering Your Event

When you [sign-up your Hour of Code event](/), you’ll receive helpful email communications with news and tips for hosting a successful Hour of Code. It’s also how you can let local volunteers know your school is participating. Volunteers are a great resource and can come speak to your class about computer science or simply help your students with Hour of Code activities.

### Get your Students Excited

Lead up to the event by sharing [inspirational videos](/promote/resources) highlighting diverse people and creative ways that computer science can be used. Or order inspirational posters for your classroom! Students are more excited to participate in a subject when they see people who look like them encouraging it.

## 5. Start your Hour of Code Strong

Once your Hour of Code celebration has arrived, make sure you start your event strong with some of these tools and tips.

Invite a [local volunteer]({{ urls/volunteer_local }}) to inspire your students by talking about the breadth of possibilities in computer science. There are thousands of volunteers around the world ready to help with your Hour of Code through either a classroom visit or video chat with your students!

Arată-le un filmulet inspirational:

- Clipul video original de lansare al Code.org, cu Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg și starul NBA Chris Bosh. (Sunt disponibile versiuni de [1minut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYZF6oIZtfc), [5 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc) și [9 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1xS07N-FA))
- Find more inspirational [resources]({{ urls/inspire }}) and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNfpD8i4Sx7U0y2MccnrNZuP).

It’s okay if both you and your students are brand new to computer science. Here are some ideas to introduce your Hour of Code activity:

- Explicați modurile în care tehnologia are impact asupra vieților noastre, cu exemple pe care atât băieții cât și fetele le vor înțelege(vorbiți despre salvarea vieților, ajutarea oamenilor, conectarea acestora etc.).
- Faceti o lista cu lucrurile la care folositi programarea in fiecare zi.
- See tips for getting girls interested in computer science [here]({{ urls/girls }}).

## 6. Get Coding!

Direct students to the activity

- Write the tutorial link on a whiteboard. Find the link listed on the [information for your selected tutorial]({{ urls/learn }}) under the number of participants.

When your students come across difficulties it's okay to respond:

- "Nu ştiu. Dar haideţi să ne dam seama de asta împreună."
- "Tehnologia nu funcţionează întotdeauna în modul în care vrem noi."
- "Învăţarea programarii este ca învăţarea unei limbi noi; nu veţi fi fluent imediat."

What if a student finishes early?

- Students can see all tutorials and [try another Hour of Code activity]({{ urls/learn }}).
- Sau îi puteți îndemna pe elevii ce au terminat prea devreme să îi ajute pe cei ce întâmpină probleme cu activitatea.
