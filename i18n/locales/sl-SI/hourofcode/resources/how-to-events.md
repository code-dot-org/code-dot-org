  * Invite media/press. i.e. local news station, newspaper, education/tech bloggers. See our [press kit](<%= hoc_uri('/resources/press-kit') %>) for help.

## 2) During your event

  * Kick off your event with one of our [inspirational videos](<%= hoc_uri('/resources#videos') %>).
  * Give an intro overviewing the importance of computer science, using these [stats and infographics](<%= hoc_uri('/resources/stats') %>).   
      
    
  * Other event ideas: 
      * Invite a local industry leader to discuss his or her work involving computer science
      * Invite a local politician and have students teach him or her how to code
      * Watch one of the Q&A sessions with an Hour of Code ambassador. They will all be recorded and on Code.org’s YouTube page. This year’s participants include Bill Gates, Sheryl Sandberg, Ashton Kutcher and more!
      * Have a group of students demonstrate an unplugged activity
      * Have a group of students teach the principal or a group of teachers how to code
      * If your school already teaches computer science, have students demo projects
