# How to bring the Hour of Code to your company

## Inspire students and volunteer for the Hour of Code

**Code.org offers company employees the opportunity to [connect](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/volunteer') %) with local classrooms doing the Hour of Code to share their tech career experience and inspire students to study computer science.**

  * [Sign up](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/volunteer') %) to volunteer.
  * For more instructions on connecting your employees with classrooms, consult our [guide for corporate partners](%= localized_file('/files/HourOfCodeGuideForCorporatePartners.pdf') %).

## Additional ways companies can support the Hour of Code:

  * Use our [marketing toolkit](%= localized_file('/files/HourOfCodeInternalMarketingToolkit.pdf') %) to create a communications timeline and share promotional content.
  * Ask your CEO to send a company-wide email emphasizing the importance of computer science and encouraging employees to spread the word. [See this email](%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#sample-emails') %).
  * Host an Hour of Code Happy Hour with coworkers to try the [tutorials](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/learn') %).
  * Host an Hour of Code event for a local classroom of students or non profits partners to do an Hour of Code at your company’s office. See event how-to guide below.

## How to host an Hour of Code event

## 1) Sign up

  * Register your [Hour of Code](%= resolve_url('/') %) during <%= campaign_date('short') %> event.
  * Promote your [Hour of Code](%= resolve_url('/promote') %) event and encourage others to host.
  * Encourage **software engineers** at your company to visit a local classroom to help lead an Hour of Code and inspire students to study computer science. They can [sign up](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/volunteer/engineer') %) to be connected with a classroom.

## 2) Watch this how-to video <iframe width="500" height="255" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/SrnvvWDm73k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
## 3) Choose a tutorial:

We’ll host a variety of [fun, hour-long tutorials](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/learn') %) for participants of all ages, created by a variety of partners. *New tutorials are coming to kick off the Hour of Code before <%= campaign_date('full') %>.* [Try current tutorials.](%= resolve_url("https://code.org/learn") %)

**所有的代碼小時教程:**

  * Require minimal prep-time
  * Are self-guided - allowing participants to work at their own pace and skill-level

## 4) Plan your technology needs - computers are optional

一小時程式設計在有網路連線的狀況下會有最佳的體驗。 You **don’t** need a computer for every participant, and can even do the Hour of Code without a computer at all.

  * Test tutorials on the devices you plan to use. Make sure they work properly on browsers with sound and video.
  * If the tutorial you choose works best with sound you may want to consider providing headphones.
  * **Don't have enough devices?** Use [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q). Have participants partner with each other. 他們也將瞭解到電腦科學是需社交與合作的。
  * Or try the [unplugged / offline tutorials](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/learn') %). These require no computers and is a great way to get participants up and moving.

## 5) Inspire participants to start your Hour of Code

Kick off your Hour of Code by inspiring participants and discussing how computer science impacts every part of our lives. Share more about what inspired you to pursue computer science and your role at your company.

**Ideas to introduce your Hour of Code activity:** - Explain ways technology impacts our lives, with examples both boys and girls will care about (Talk about technology that’s saving lives, helping people, connecting people). - If you are a tech company, demo fun, innovative products your company is working on. - If you aren’t a tech company, discuss ways your company uses technology to solve problems and accomplish goals. - Invite software engineers from your company to speak about why they decided to study computer science and the projects they work on. - See tips for getting girls interested in computer science [here](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/girls') %).

## 6) Code!

**Direct participants to the activity**

  * Write the tutorial link on a whiteboard. Find the link listed on the [information for your selected tutorial](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/learn') %) under the number of participants.
  * For younger students, load the tutorial page ahead of time or save it as a bookmark.

**When participants come across difficulties it's okay to respond:**

  * “I don’t know. Let’s figure this out together.”
  * “Technology doesn’t always work out the way we want.”
  * “Learning to program is like learning a new language; you won’t be fluent right away.”

**What to do if someone finishes early?**

  * They can try another Hour of Code activity at code.org/learn
  * Or, ask them to help a friend who are having trouble with the activity.
