# How your company can engage with the Hour of Code

### 讓你和你的員工有機會啟發學生學習計算機科學！

* * *

Computational thinking helps nurture problem-solving skills, logic, and creativity. And technology is transforming every industry on the planet. Students today should learn how to create technology, not just use it. By starting early, they’ll have a foundation for success in any 21st-century career path.

During the Hour of Code campaign, your company can help raise awareness of the computer science movement. Whether you volunteer as an individual or plan an event for your company, all of your efforts can make a huge impact on the way young women and students from marginalized racial and ethnic groups view computer science and their own potential.

## Encourage employees to volunteer with a classroom

[![](/images/fit-600/Marketing/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-3762940.jpg)]({{ urls/learn }})

One of the most fulfilling ways to participate in the Hour of Code is to volunteer with a local classroom, either in-person or virtually. Best of all, you don’t have to be an engineer in order to volunteer. You can still provide a meaningful experience to students by sharing your own career experience and how CS or technology have impacted your role.

[<button>Sign up to volunteer</button>]({{ urls/volunteer }})

Once a volunteer registers, a teacher can review their profile on our [volunteer map](https://code.org/volunteer/local) - so profiles should be submitted as complete as possible. If you’re a good fit for their classroom, a teacher will contact you through the platform (we will never share your email address with the teacher). You can then coordinate details directly with the teacher around [how to best volunteer with their classroom](https://hourofcode.com/us/how-to/volunteers).

For more guidance on volunteering and sample messaging to get your company excited about the Hour of Code, check out our [guide for corporate partners]({{ localized_files/hoc_corporate_toolkit }}).

## Connect your company with a school

You don’t have to use our volunteer map in order to connect with a classroom or school. Oftentimes, we recommend starting locally. Consider if there are schools that you or your employees have a strong connection to such as an alma mater, a child’s school, or an organization or school that is focused on serving a population that has been historically underrepresented in computer science.

[![](/images/fit-600/Marketing/2018_HoC-392.jpg)]({{ urls/learn }})

From there, you can visit the school’s website to find appropriate contacts to reach out to such as administrators like a Principal or Vice Principal, technology or computer science instructors, or even the school’s PTSA. You could also partner with organizations such as the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, a YMCA branch, and more to co-host an event.

If you are unable to connect with a school, please [contact us](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we’ll connect you with one of our local partners if possible.

## Host your own Hour of Code event

If you want to go the extra mile, your company can also host an Hour of Code event. There is no specific formula for hosting an event so we encourage you to be creative! Given that our staff size is small (but mighty!), Code.org does not have a team dedicated to coordinating Hour of Code events. However, here are some tips to get started.

### 1. 觀看入門影片 <iframe width="500" height="255" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/SrnvvWDm73k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen mark="crwd-mark"></iframe> 

### 2. Determine a date, format, and location for your event

We’ve seen events that are [virtual](https://hourofcode.com/us/how-to/virtual) or in-person, at the company office or held in the community, and for students of all ages! You can also take a look at what other [corporate partners](https://medium.com/@codeorg/amazon-microsoft-google-vista-and-more-rally-to-bring-the-hour-of-code-to-students-worldwide-4641325542cf) and [donors](https://medium.com/@codeorg/how-code-orgs-corporate-supporters-helped-spread-the-love-for-2019-s-hour-of-code-73a3c088f10f) have done in the past for some inspiring ideas.

<br />

#### Sample Agenda:

|Time | Agenda Item | |\---\---\---\---\---\---\---\---\---\---\---\---\---\---\---\---- | \---\---\---\---\----- | |1-5 minutes | Show an [inspirational video](https://hourofcode.com/us/promote/resources#videos)|  
|5-10 minutes | Introduce yourself and learn more about the students: Where do you work, what do you do, and what do you love most about your job? 什麼或誰激勵了你 你是如何對計算機科學感興趣的？ 你有導師嗎？ 問學生問題，並留下時間問問題 |  
|30-60 minutes | Code! If your event is in-person, this is the time to answer questions and guide students through tough puzzles. Try not to give them the solution outright, instead, try asking them questions so they can answer themselves what went wrong, and encourage students to ask each other if they have questions. If you are volunteering virtually, work with the teacher on what the best approach might be. It may make more sense to return at the end of the session to see what progress students have made. | | |1-3 minutes | Thank everyone and share inspirational parting words. Hand out any of your company swag ([stickers](#celebrate) are awesome)! | | <br />

#### Other ideas to add to your event

- Explain ways technology impacts our lives, with examples that students of all backgrounds will care about - talk about technology that’s saving lives, helping people, connecting people. 
- If you are a tech company, demo fun, innovative products your company is working on. If you aren’t a tech company, discuss ways your company uses technology to solve problems and accomplish goals.
- 從你的公司邀請軟體工程師來聊聊他們為什麼決定學計算機科學，還有他們進行中的計畫。
- If you have a group of staff that will be facilitating your event or volunteering with a local school, consider ordering [custom t-shirts](http://blog.code.org/post/132608499493/hour-of-code-shirts-and-more) for your employees.

### 3. Plan your technology needs

[![](/images/fit-600/Marketing/Excel-Charter-SchoolHoC-2015-stills-9.jpg)]({{ urls/learn }})

#### Devices:

一小時玩程式課程在有網路連線的電腦上會有最佳的體驗。 But you don’t need a computer for every child, and you can even do the Hour of Code without a computer at all! For unplugged activities, simply filter the Classroom Technology section to show options for “No computers or devices”.

- **Test activities** on computers or devices. Make sure they work properly on browsers with sound and video.
- **Don't have enough devices?** Use pair programming. 當學生們合作時，他們會互相幫忙，並減少對老師的依賴。 他們也將瞭解到計算機科學是需要社交與合作的。
- **Provide headphones** for your participants or ask them to bring their own if they’ll be trying tutorials that work best with sounds.
- **Have low bandwidth**? Plan to show videos at the front of the event, so each participant isn't downloading their own videos. Or try the unplugged / offline activities.

#### Virtual Events:

If your event is going to be virtual, you’ll want to decide on your conference platform (and test it) prior to your event. This may impact the number of students you feel comfortable engaging, so it’s best to determine this prior to inviting a classroom or promoting your event. For ideas on how to run a remote Hour of Code, read our [tips for a virtual Hour of Code event](https://hourofcode.com/us/how-to/virtual).

### 4. Choose an activity

We provide a variety of fun, student-guided tutorials for all age groups and experience levels. It’s popular for students to try self-led tutorials, though you may want to begin the event with an [inspirational video](https://hourofcode.com/us/promote/resources#videos) for everyone to view together.

<a href="https://hourofcode.com/us/learn">Explore the activities</a> and decide ahead of time if you want to choose a single tutorial for all of your guests, or let each child pick their own. **所有的一小時玩程式活動**都不需要做過多的準備，因為它可以讓參與者依自己的進度和程度自我學習。

[![](/images/fit-700/tutorials.png)]({{ urls/learn }})

Once you have a solid roadmap for your event, you can then start inviting students, a school, or the larger community. We recommend starting with a local school you have a relationship with or [browsing our map](https://hourofcode.com/us/map) of Hour of Code events.

### 5. Celebrate

[![](/images/fit-600/Marketing/2018_HoC-391.jpg)]({{ urls/learn }})

After students or guests have completed their Hour of Code, it’s time to celebrate their success. Here are some ideas for making your event even more fun:

- [Print certificates]({{ urls/certificates }}) for participants and students.
- [Print "I did an Hour of Code! stickers"]({{ promote/resources_stickers }}) or find other prizes and swag on the [Code.org Amazon Store](https://code.org/shop). 
- 在社群平台分享一小時玩程式的活動照片及影片，使用 #HourOfCode 和 @codeorg，這樣一來也可以突顯你的成功。
