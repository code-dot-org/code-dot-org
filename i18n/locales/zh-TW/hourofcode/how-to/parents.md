# How to complete an Hour of Code with your child

Complete an Hour of Code at home, or volunteer to bring it to your child’s classroom! Here’s how:

## 1) 觀看指南影片 <iframe width="500" height="255" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/SrnvvWDm73k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
## 2) 選擇一個教程︰

We provide a variety of fun, hour-long tutorials for students of all ages, created by a variety of partners. [Try them out!](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/learn') %)

**All Hour of Code tutorials are self-guided - allowing your child to work at their own pace and skill level**

[![](/images/fit-700/tutorials.png)](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/learn') %)

## 3) Plan your technology needs

The best Hour of Code experience will be with Internet-connected computers. But you **don’t** need a computer. There are many activities that are "unplugged" and can be done without any technology at all.

- Test tutorials on your computer or device. Make sure they work properly on browsers with sound and video.
- **Want to learn alongside your child?** Try [pair programming.](http://www.ncwit.org/resources/pair-programming-box-power-collaborative-learning) Computer science is social and collaborative.

## 4) Start your Hour of Code off with an inspiring video

Kick off your Hour of Code by inspiring your child and discussing how computer science impacts every part of our lives.

**Show an inspirational video:**

- 原 Code.org 的揭幕影片，由微軟總裁比爾 · 蓋茨、 臉書創辦人馬克 · 佐伯克和 NBA 明星球員克里斯·波許代言(有 [1 分鐘](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYZF6oIZtfc)、 [5 分鐘](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc) 和 [9 分鐘](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1xS07N-FA) 版本)
- [Hour od Code 2013 年揭幕影片](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC5FbmsH4fw)，或者 <% if @country == 'uk' %> = '英國'[Hour od Code 2014 年影片](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L97YMYqLHc) <% else %> [Hour od Code 2014 年影片](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L97YMYqLHc) <% end %>
- [美國歐巴馬呼籲所有的學生都要學習電腦科學](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvmhE1J9PY)
- Find more inspirational [resources](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/inspire') %) and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNfpD8i4Sx7U0y2MccnrNZuP).

It’s okay if both you and your child are brand new to computer science. Here are some ideas to introduce your Hour of Code activity:

- Explain ways technology impacts our lives, with examples both boys and girls will care about (Talk about saving lives, helping people, connecting people, etc.).
- List things that use code in everyday life.
- See tips for getting girls interested in computer science [here](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/girls') %).

When you've chosen the tutorial you would like to do, you can bookmark the tutorial's short link.

**When your child come across difficulties**

It’s okay to respond:

- 「我也不知道，我們一起找出方法吧。」
- 「科技總不是做我們想要的。」
- 「學習程式設計就像是學習新的語言；你不會馬上就上手。」

## 6) Celebrate

[Print certificates](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/certificates') %) for your child (and yourself!).
