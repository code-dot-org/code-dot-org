# How to teach one Hour of Code in after-school

## 1) Sign up

  * Sign up to host an [Hour of Code](%= resolve_url('/') %) during <%= campaign_date('short') %>.
  * Promote your [Hour of Code](%= resolve_url('/promote') %) and encourage others to host.

## 2) Watch this how-to video <iframe width="500" height="255" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/SrnvvWDm73k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
## 3) Choose a tutorial:

We’ll host a variety of [fun, hour-long tutorials](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/learn') %) for participants all ages, created by a variety of partners. *New tutorials are coming to kick off the Hour of Code before <%= campaign_date('full') %>.* [Try current tutorials.](%= resolve_url("https://code.org/learn") %)

**所有的代碼小時教程:**

  * Require minimal prep-time for organizers
  * Are self-guided - allowing kids to work at their own pace and skill-level

## 4) Plan your technology needs - computers are optional

The best Hour of Code experience will be with Internet-connected computers. You **don’t** need a computer for every child, and can even do the Hour of Code without a computer at all.

  * Test tutorials on computers or devices. Make sure they work properly on browsers with sound and video.
  * Provide headphones, or ask participants to bring their own, if the tutorial you choose works best with sound.
  * **Don't have enough devices?** Use [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q). When kids partner up, they help each other and rely less on the organizer. 他們也將瞭解到電腦科學是需社交與合作的。
  * **Have low bandwidth?** Plan to project videos onto a big screen, so everyone isn't downloading their own videos. Or try the unplugged / offline tutorials.

## 5) Inspire participants to start your Hour of Code

Kick off your Hour of Code by inspiring participants and discussing how computer science impacts every part of our lives.

**Show an inspirational video:**

  * 原 Code.org 的揭幕影片，由微軟總裁比爾 · 蓋茨、 臉書創辦人馬克 · 佐伯克和 NBA 明星球員克里斯·波許代言(有 [1 分鐘](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYZF6oIZtfc)、 [5 分鐘](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc) 和 [9 分鐘](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1xS07N-FA) 版本)
  * [Hour od Code 2013 年揭幕影片](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC5FbmsH4fw)，或者 <% if @country == 'uk' %> = '英國'[Hour od Code 2014 年影片](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L97YMYqLHc) <% else %> [Hour od Code 2014 年影片](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L97YMYqLHc) <% end %>

  * Find more inspirational video [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNfpD8i4Sx7U0y2MccnrNZuP).

**It’s okay if you are both brand new to computer science. Here are some ideas to introduce your Hour of Code activity:**

  * Explain ways technology impacts our lives, with examples both boys and girls will care about (Talk about apps and technology that is used to save lives, help people, connect people etc).
  * List things that use code in everyday life.
  * See tips for getting girls interested in computer science [here](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/girls') %).

**Need more guidance?** Download this [template lesson plan](/files/AfterschoolEducatorLessonPlanOutline.docx).

**Want more teaching ideas?** Check out [best practices](http://www.slideshare.net/TeachCode/hour-of-code-best-practices-for-successful-educators-51273466) from experienced educators.

## 6) Code!

**Direct participants to the activity**

  * Write the tutorial link on a whiteboard. Find the link listed on the [information for your selected tutorial](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/learn') %) under the number of participants.

**When someone comes across difficulties it's okay to respond:**

  * “I don’t know. Let’s figure this out together.”
  * “Technology doesn’t always work out the way we want.”
  * “Learning to program is like learning a new language; you won’t be fluent right away.”

**What to do if someone finishes early?**

  * Encourage participants to try another Hour of Code activity at [<%= resolve_url('code.org/learn') %>](%= resolve_url('https://code.org/learn') %)
  * Or, ask those who finish early to help others who are having trouble.
