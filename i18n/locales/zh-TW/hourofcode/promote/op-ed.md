**Title: Computing…Where the Jobs Are**

**By [NAME] and [CONSIDER CO-AUTHORING WITH EDUCATOR, SUPERINTENDENT OR BUSINESS LEADER]**

電腦充斥在我們的日常生活中。 他們就在我們的口袋裡。 他們就在我們的牆壁上。 他們就在我們的汽車中。 它們是我們的基礎設施中的重要零件，從電網、紅綠燈、到金融市場的內部運作。 所有的這些計算機都有一個共同點。 他們依靠軟體來告訴他們該怎麼做。

但究竟是誰會寫這個軟體呢？

想想世界有多快地被科技轉變，你可能以為學習電腦科學的K-12學生數量空前的高。 那你就錯了。 事實上，比起十年前，愈來愈少的學生學習計算機科學，愈來愈少的學校教它。

當對熟練的程式設計師的要求空前的高，我們反而培養出更少的電腦科學家。 即使在現在失業率如此高的現在，在**[INSERT STATE/CITY]**，數以千計的工作機會卻空缺著因為許多人沒有適當的技術能力。

Why is this? And how can we address it?

The problem begins in our middle and high schools. Nine out of ten of our schools do not offer computer programming classes. In **[SCHOOL DISTRICT]** last year, only **[NUMBER]** students took the college-level Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science Exam, just **[%]** of all students who took an AP in our state. We’re simply not doing enough to prepare or encourage our students to pursue these high-paying, vital careers.

Nearly all major computing innovations were invented here in this country, but we’re at risk of losing that leadership if we don’t do something now.

我們需要做出一些改變。

**[OPTIONAL FOR STATES WHERE THIS APPLIES]**

One positive change would be to allow rigorous computer science courses to satisfy a high school math or science graduation requirement. In **[INSERT STATE]**, computer science courses are electives. Given academic demands, students cannot afford to take elective computer science courses. And making this change can have a big impact. In states where computer science courses count toward graduation requirements, courses are fifty percent larger with much higher rates of participation by underserved minorities than states that treat computer science as an elective.

We should also work with students at a young age to spark their interest in computer science and coding. Our children should not just know how to use apps and play video games – they should know how to create them. Children can learn the basics of coding as early as the second grade.

We need to recruit more computer science teachers and encourage professional development within their field. Today there are many online resources that can help teachers access and keep up to date with the latest technology for their students.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, by 2020, there will be 9.2 million jobs in STEM fields. Half of those jobs—4.6 million—will be in computing or information technology. And computer science is increasingly foundational knowledge for the 21st Century. Who will fill these jobs if our children are not given the opportunity to gain the skills needed?

This week, <%= campaign_date('full') %>, is Computer Science Education Week. 在**[STATE]**的學校，我們的學校將參與全國性的一小時玩程式活動，學生們可以瞭解什麼是計算機科學，並引導他們持續學習。 I will be joining them, and I invite you to join in as well. Everyone should learn how to code. 造訪 https://hourofcode.com/<%= @country %> 以進一步學習。 And support our efforts to bring computer science to more schools in **[STATE]**.
