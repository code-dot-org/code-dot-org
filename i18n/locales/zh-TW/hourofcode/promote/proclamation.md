[HOUSE,SENATE, STATE, COUNTY OR CITY RESOLUTION OR PROCLAMATION ###] – Whereas Computer Science Education Week highlights the crucial role that computer science plays in transforming our society and how computer science enables innovation and creates economic opportunities;

[HOUSE OR SENATE RESOLUTION ###]

[DATE]

而計算機技術是組成現代文化一個重要部分，它正轉變人與人、人與周遭一切的互動方式。

而計算機科學正在轉變工業，開闢新的經濟模式，引領革新整個科學領域，推動創新和促進生產力。

Whereas the field of computer science underpins the information technology sector of our economy, which is a significant contributor to United States economic output;

而計算機科學領域是數位世代的基礎性科學；

Whereas the information technology sector is uniquely positioned to help with economic recovery through the research and development of new innovations;

而計算機科學就業前景一片光明，全國有超過 500,000 個的就業機會。

Whereas providing students the chance to participate in high-quality computer science activities exposes them to the rich opportunities the field offers and provides critical thinking skills that will serve them throughout their lives;

Whereas all students deserve a thorough preparation in computer science education, including access to the qualified teachers, technology, and age-appropriate curriculum needed to learn computer science at the elementary and secondary levels of education;

Whereas computer science education has challenges to address, including counting computer science classes towards high school graduation requirements, and providing professional development for computer science teachers;

而在計算機科學教育週期間參與一小時玩程式活動，有助於揭開計算機科學領域的神秘面紗，並鼓勵更多的學生進一步研究計算機科學；

Whereas the field of computer science has significant equity barriers to address, including attracting more participation by females and underrepresented minorities to all levels and branches;

Whereas Grace Murray Hopper, one of the first females in the field of computer science, engineered new programming languages and pioneered standards for computer systems which laid the foundation for many advancements in computer science; and

Whereas the week of <%= campaign_date('start-long') %>, in honor of Grace Hopper's birthday, is designated as ‘Computer Science Education Week’: Now, therefore, be it

Resolved, That the [HOUSE OR SENATE, STATE, COUNTY, CITY OR SCHOOL BOARD] --

(1) supports the designation of Computer Science Education Week (<%= campaign_date('full') %>);

(2) 透過幫助學生參與一小時玩程式活動的過程中，同時鼓勵學校、教師、家長和決策者加入計算機科學週；

(3) encourages schools, teachers, researchers, universities, business leaders and policymakers to identify mechanisms for teachers to receive cutting edge professional development to provide sustainable learning experiences in computer science at all educational levels and encourage students to be exposed to computer science concepts;

(4) encourages policymakers to remove barriers that prevent computer science classes from being counted as math or science credits toward graduation requirements;

(5) encourages opportunities, including through existing programs, for females and underrepresented minorities in computer science.
