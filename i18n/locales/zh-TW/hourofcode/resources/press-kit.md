## 如何吸引媒體目光至您的Hour of Code活動

*For all press and media inquiries, contact <press@code.org>*

### 關鍵技巧

  * 在活動舉辦兩週前，透過電子郵件聯繫媒體。若沒有收到任何回應，則再進一步用電子郵件與電話追蹤。
  * 請求學校行政人員或志工拍攝照片分享於網路上或寄送給記者。
  * 在您的網站首頁及學校刊物上撰寫有關Hour of Code的文章。報導您活動的細節，以及學生活動的照片。
  * 在 12 月 8-14日期間於 Facebook 和 Twitter上，分享您計畫狀態，發佈您的活動和張貼圖片。請使用標籤 **#HourOfCode**讓 Code.org 可以看到和宣傳您的活動。

### 逐步指南

**1. Plan your event**

  * 規劃如何揭開Hour of Code序幕。
  * 寄送 [ 一封信](<%= hoc_uri('/resources/#sample-emails') %>) 給家長。請求他們散播訊相關訊息。
  * 發送 [ 一封信](<%= hoc_uri('/resources/#sample-emails') %>) 邀請您的地方首長、 國會議員、 省長或有影響力的商人出席及對您的學生演講。
  * 組織系列活動 (如示範不插電的程式設計活動)，或展示學生創建和領導的活動。
  * 播放 Code.org 的 [ Hour of Code影片](<%= hoc_uri('/') %>) 或透過 [ 這些](<%= hoc_uri('/resources#videos') %>) 其中之一以引起動機。

**2. Identify specific local reporters that cover education or local events.**

Think a local newspaper, TV station, radio station or blog.

Look online to find reporter contact information. If you can't find it, call the publication to ask, or email a general tips@PUBLICATIONNAME.com email address and ask for your message to be directed to the correct reporter.

**3. Contact local media**

The best way to reach out is by email. It should be short and communicate: why should other people care about this event? Include contact information (including a cellphone number) for who will be on site at the event. **See a [sample pitch to media](<%= hoc_uri('/resources#sample-emails') %>):**

**4. Prepare to field questions about your school event. Here are some examples:**

*Why is your school doing an Hour of Code?*

While all of us know that it’s important for students to learn how to navigate today’s tech-saturated world, many teachers aren’t experienced in computer science and don’t know where to start. This event is a chance for all of us to see what computer science is about.

We hope it’ll spark interest in students to keep learning. Research also shows that kids pick up programming concepts before they know how to read and write. In fact, their brains are more receptive to computer languages at a young age, just like foreign languages.

*Why is this important?*

In China, every students takes computer science to graduate high school. In the U.S., 90 percent of schools don’t even teach it. It’s time for us to catch up to the 21st century. We know that regardless of what our students do when they grow up, whether they go into medicine, business, politics, or the arts, knowing how to build technology will give them the confidence and know-how to succeed.

**More details and a quote you can use in materials**

"The Hour of Code is designed to demystify code and show that computer science is not rocket-science, anybody can learn the basics," said Hadi Partovi, founder and CEO of Code.org. "In one week last year, 15 million students tried an Hour of Code. Now we're aiming for 100 million worldwide to prove that the demand for relevant 21st century computer science education crosses all borders and knows no boundaries."

**關於 Code.org**

Code.org® is a 501c3 public non-profit dedicated to expanding participation in computer science and increasing participation by women and underrepresented students of color. Its vision is that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer programming. After launching in 2013, Code.org organized the Hour of Code campaign — which has introduced millions of students to computer science — partnered with more than 30 public school districts nationwide, and launched Code Studio, an open-source, online learning platform for all ages.
