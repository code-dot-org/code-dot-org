          description: |
            In this unit, students extend their understanding of the internet and how it functions by building off the concepts learned when sending bits in Unit 1. The unit largely explores the
            structure and design of the internet and the implications of those design decisions including
            the reliability of network communication, the security of data, and personal privacy. Topics
            include the Internet Protocol (IP), DNS, TCP/IP, cryptography and other security and hacking
            concerns.

The data-rich world we live in also introduces many complex questions related to public policy, law, ethics and societal impact. Understanding where data comes from, having intuitions about what could be learned or extracted from it, and being able to use computational tools to manipulate data and communicate about it are the primary skills addressed in the unit.
