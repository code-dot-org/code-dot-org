  hoc_faq_title: "FAQs"
  hoc_faq_what_is_hoc_q: "Čo je Hodina kódu?"
  hoc_faq_what_is_hoc_a: "The Hour of Code is a one-hour introduction to computer science, designed to demystify code and show that anybody can learn the basics. <a href='http://code.org/learn'>Check out the tutorials</a>."
  hoc_faq_last_year: "Try the tutorials"
  hoc_faq_when_is_hoc_q: "When is the Hour of Code?"
  hoc_faq_when_is_hoc_a: "Anybody can host an Hour of Code anytime, but the grassroots campaign goal is for tens of millions of students to try an Hour of Code during December 8-14, 2014, in celebration of <a href='http://csedweek.org'>Computer Science Education Week</a>. Is it one specific <i>hour</i>? No. You can do the Hour of Code anytime during this week. (And if you can't do it during that week, do it the week before or after)."
  hoc_faq_why_cs_q: "Why computer science?"
  hoc_faq_why_cs_a: "<i>Every</i> student should have the opportunity to learn computer science. It helps nurture problem-solving skills, logic and creativity. By starting early, students will have a foundation for success in any 21st-century career path. See more stats on <a href='http://code.org'>Code.org</a>."
  hoc_faq_how_participate_q: "How do I participate in the Hour of Code?"
  hoc_faq_how_participate_a: "Sign up to host an Hour of Code event <a href='http://hourofcode.org'>here</a> and <a href='target-resources-how-to'>start planning</a>. You can organize an Hour of Code event at your school or in your community &mdash; like in an extracurricular club, non-profit or at work. Or, just try it yourself when Dec. 8 arrives."
  hoc_faq_behind_hoc_q: "Who is behind the Hour of Code?"
  hoc_faq_behind_hoc_a: "The Hour of Code is organized by <a href='http://code.org'>Code.org</a>, a public 501c3 non-profit dedicated to expanding participation in computer science by making it available in more schools, and increasing participation by women and underrepresented students of color. An <a href='http://code.org/about/partners'>unprecedented coalition of partners</a> have come together to support the Hour of Code, too &mdash; including Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Boys and Girls Clubs of America and the College Board."
  hoc_faq_host_q: "I don't know anything about coding. Can I still host an event?"
  hoc_faq_host_a: "Of course. Hour of Code activities are self-guided. All you have to do is <a href='http://code.org/learn'>try our current tutorials</a>, pick the tutorial you want, and pick an hour &mdash; we take care of the rest. We also have options for every age and experience-level, from kindergarten and up. Start planning your event by reading our <a href='target-resources-how-to'>how to guide</a>."
  hoc_faq_need_computers_q: "Do I need computers for every participant?"
  hoc_faq_need_computers_a: "No. We have Hour of Code tutorials that work on PCs, smartphones, tablets, and some that require no computer at all! You can join wherever you are, with whatever you have. <p><i>Here are a few options:</i> <br> <ul> <li><b>Work in pairs.</b> Research shows students learn best with <a href='http://www.ncwit.org/resources/pair-programming-box-power-collaborative-learning'>pair programming</a>, sharing a computer and working together. Encourage your students to double up. <li><b>Use a projected screen.</b> If you have a projector and screen for a Web-connected computer, your entire group can do an Hour of Code together. Watch video portions together and take turns solving puzzles or answering questions. <li><b>Go unplugged.</b> We offer tutorials that require no computer at all. </ul>"
  hoc_faq_international_q: 'I am in <country>. How do I participate internationally?'
  hoc_faq_international_a: "Anyone can organize an Hour of Code event, anywhere in the world. Last year, students worldwide joined together for the Hour of Code. Find out more <a href='target-resources'>here</a>."
  hoc_faq_tutorial_q: "How can I make an Hour of Code tutorial?"
  hoc_faq_tutorial_a: "If you're interested in becoming a tutorial partner, <a href='target-tutorial-guidelines'>see our guidelines and instructions</a>. We'd like to host a variety of engaging options, but the primary goal is to optimize the experience for students and teachers who are new to computer science."
  hoc_faq_more_questions_q: "Still have more questions?"
  hoc_faq_more_questions_a: "Try finding an answer in our <a href='http://support.code.org'>support forum</a>."
  hoc_faq_scratch_q: "I am doing Scratch for Hour of Code, but what if my students have iPads rather than laptops?"
  hoc_faq_scratch_a: "Scratch doesn't run on tablets. If your students are young, they can use the ScratchJR iPad app (for early-readers). If you look at the tutorials on <a href='http://code.org/learn'>Code.org/learn</a>, you can find other tutorials that work on iPads - from Code.org, Tynker, Lightbot, or CodeSpark."
  hoc_faq_account_q: "Do students need to log on using an account?"
  hoc_faq_account_a: "No. Absolutely no signup or login is required for students to try the Hour of Code. Most of the <a href='http://code.org/learn/beyond'>follow-on courses</a> require account creation to save student progress."
  hoc_faq_frozen_q: "Where is the tutorial with Anna and Elsa?"
  hoc_faq_frozen_a: "It is now published on <a href='http://code.org/learn'>Code.org/learn</a>. We hope you enjoy it!"
  hoc_faq_high_school_q: "Which activity should I do with high school students?"
  hoc_faq_high_school_a: "Across all ages, we recommend trying one of the beginner tutorials on <a href='http://code.org/learn'>Code.org/learn</a> to start, such as the tutorial with Angry Birds or with Anna and Elsa. A high school student should be able to finish one of these in 30 minutes and can then try a more advanced tutorial in JavaScript, such as KhanAcademy or CodeHS."
  hoc_faq_more_questions_br_q: "Outras dúvidas?"
  hoc_faq_more_questions_br_a: "Por favor visite nosso <a href='http://support.code.org'>forum de suporte</a> disponível apenas em inglês."
  hoc_faq_what_is_hoc_uk_a: "The Hour of Code is a one-hour introduction to computer science, designed to demystify code and show that anybody can learn the basics. <a href='http://uk.code.org/learn'>Check out the tutorials</a>, and look out for new ones coming for the Hour of Code 2014."
  hoc_faq_when_is_hoc_uk_a: "The Hour of Code will take place during December 8-14, 2014. Is it one specific <i>hour</i>? No. You can do the Hour of Code anytime during this week. The Hour of Code in the UK will happen at the same time as in the US where it is timed to celebrate the annual <a href='http://csedweek.org'>Computer Science Education Week.</a>"
