**DATE** - [**INSERT NAME**] joined the principal and faculty members of [**INSERT NAME OF SCHOOL**], business leaders and local families today for [**NAME OF EVENT**] to participate in the Hour of Code as part of Computer Science Education Week . [INSERT NAME] and community members were among tens of millions of people around the world to take part in the largest learning event in history.

[**INSERT DETAILS OF EVENT, USE DESCRIPTIVE AND QUANTIFIABLE LANGUAGE. FOR EXAMPLE:**]  
“Daniels Run Elementary school held a school-wide Hour of Code event to expose its students to computer science. More than 700 students from all grades did at least one Hour of Code. And a dozen parents and volunteers from the community helped with the day and brought the kids together for an assembly showcasing why computer science matters in the lives of these students.”

[**SAMPLE STOCK TEXT FOR CONTEXT:**]  
Computers are everywhere, but fewer schools teach computer science than 10 years ago. Girls and students of color are severely underrepresented. The good news is we’re changing this for the better. The Hour of Code is gateway toward providing all students with access to high-quality computer science education.

During Computer Science Education Week last year, 15 million students tried the Hour of Code. Інформатика була на домашніх сторінках Google, MSN, Yahoo! та Діснею. Президент Обама, Шакіра і Ештон Катчер розпочали Годину коду відео-зверненням. Більше 100 партнерів підтримали цей рух.

This year the Hour of Code movement is aiming for 100 million students.

[**INSERT QUOTE FROM SPOKESPERSON, EXAMPLE BELOW:**]  
“We need to encourage and embrace our students’ interest in computer science,” said [**INSERT NAME**]. “Every student deserves the chance to learn computer science to access the best careers of the 21st century.”
