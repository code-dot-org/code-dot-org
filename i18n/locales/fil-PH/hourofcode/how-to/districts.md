# How to bring the Hour of Code to your entire school district

## Kumuha ng mga kalahok sa bawat paaralan, bawat mag-aaral ay matututo!

1. **Recruit local schools.** Share [this email](%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#sample-emails') %) and [teacher how to guide](%= resolve_url('/how-to') %), or include a [short blurb](%= resolve_url('/promote/stats') %) in newsletters/district communications.

2. **Provide a sample logistics plan for schools.** Share this [sample logistics plan](%= localized_file('/files/HOC_Logistics_plan.pdf') %) with schools to give them ideas of how to organize whole school participation. Ito ay napaka-dali tulad ng paggawa nito sa bawat klase ng matematika, homeroom, o sa loob ng bawat linggo sa computer lab.
