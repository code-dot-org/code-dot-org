  hoc_faq_what_is_hoc_q: Ano ba ang Hour of Code?
  hoc_faq_what_is_hoc_a: "The Hour of Code is a one-hour introduction to computer science, designed to demystify code and show that anybody can learn the basics. <a href='http://code.org/learn'>Check out the tutorials</a>, and look out for new ones coming for the Hour of Code 2014."
  hoc_faq_last_year: "Try last year's tutorials"
  hoc_faq_when_is_hoc_q: When is the Hour of Code?
  hoc_faq_when_is_hoc_a: "Anybody can host an Hour of Code anytime, but the grassroots campaign goal is for tens of millions of students to try an Hour of Code during December 8-14, 2014, in celebration of <a href='http://csedweek.org'>Computer Science Education Week</a>. Is it one specific <i>hour</i>? No. You can do the Hour of Code anytime during this week. (And if you can't do it during that week, do it the week before or after)."
  hoc_faq_why_cs_q: Bakit computer science?
  hoc_faq_why_cs_a: "<i>Every</i> student should have the opportunity to learn computer science. It helps nurture problem-solving skills, logic and creativity. By starting early, students will have a foundation for success in any 21st-century career path. See more stats on <a href='http://code.org'>Code.org</a>."
  hoc_faq_how_participate_q: How do I participate in the Hour of Code?
  hoc_faq_how_participate_a: "Sign up to host an Hour of Code event <a href='http://hourofcode.org'>here</a> and <a href='target-resources-how-to'>start planning</a>. You can organize an Hour of Code event at your school or in your community &mdash; like in an extracurricular club, non-profit or at work. Or, just try it yourself when Dec. 8 arrives."
  hoc_faq_behind_hoc_q: 'SinecH Eteh @nG nAza Lik0d n6 HoUr 0F c@de '
  hoc_faq_behind_hoc_a: "The Hour of Code is organized by <a href='http://code.org'>Code.org</a>, a public 501c3 non-profit dedicated to expanding participation in computer science by making it available in more schools, and increasing participation by women and underrepresented students of color. An <a href='http://code.org/about/partners'>unprecedented coalition of partners</a> have come together to support the Hour of Code, too &mdash; including Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Boys and Girls Clubs of America and the College Board."
  hoc_faq_host_q: Wala akong alam sa coding. Maaari parin ba akong mag hawak ng event?
  hoc_faq_host_a: "Of course. Hour of Code activities are self-guided. All you have to do is <a href='http://code.org/learn'>try our current tutorials</a>, pick the tutorial you want, and pick an hour &mdash; we take care of the rest. We also have options for every age and experience-level, from kindergarten and up. Start planning your event by reading our <a href='target-resources-how-to'>how to guide</a>."
  hoc_faq_need_computers_q: Do I need computers for every participant?
  hoc_faq_need_computers_a: "No. We have Hour of Code tutorials that work on PCs, smartphones, tablets, and some that require no computer at all! You can join wherever you are, with whatever you have. <p><i>Here are a few options:</i> <br> <ul> <li><b>Work in pairs.</b> Research shows students learn best with <a href='http://www.ncwit.org/resources/pair-programming-box-power-collaborative-learning'>pair programming</a>, sharing a computer and working together. Encourage your students to double up. <li><b>Use a projected screen.</b> If you have a projector and screen for a Web-connected computer, your entire group can do an Hour of Code together. Watch video portions together and take turns solving puzzles or answering questions. <li><b>Go unplugged.</b> We offer tutorials that require no computer at all. </ul>"
  hoc_faq_international_q: "I'm outside of the United States. How do I participate internationally?"
  hoc_faq_international_a: Anyone can organize an Hour of Code event, anywhere in the world. Last year, students worldwide joined together for the Hour of Code.
  hoc_faq_tutorial_q: How can I make an Hour of Code tutorial?
  hoc_faq_tutorial_a: "If you're interested in becoming a tutorial partner, <a href='target-tutorial-guidelines'>see our guidelines and instructions</a>. We'd like to host a variety of engaging options, but the primary goal is to optimize the experience for students and teachers who are new to computer science."
  hoc_faq_more_questions_q: Still have more questions?
  hoc_faq_more_questions_a: "Try finding an answer in our <a href='http://support.code.org'>support forum</a>."
  hoc_faq_more_questions_br_q: Outras dúvidas?
