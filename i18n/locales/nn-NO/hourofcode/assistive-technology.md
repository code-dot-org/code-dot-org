# Fullfør Kodetimen med assisterande teknologi

Alle kan prøve Kodetimen i løpet av Kodeveka.

## Bruk skjermlesarar

The Hour of Code activities page now includes a [filter for activities compatible with screen readers](https://hourofcode.com/us/learn?platform=screenreader).

If you use a screen reader, the [Quorum tutorial for beginners](https://quorumlanguage.com/hourofcode/astro1.html) or the [Quorum tutorial for comfortable students](https://quorumlanguage.com/hourofcode/part1.html) are great places to start an Hour of Code. Quorum started as an interpreted language originally designed to be accessible through screen readers. It has become a general purpose programming language designed for any user. Og dersom du ønsker å gå vidare etter ein kodetime, har teamet hos Quorum tilleggsverkty og pensum. If you use a screen reader and are interested in robotics, try the [Dash Joins a Dance Circle activity](https://milnel2.github.io/blocks4alliOS/danceCircle1.html) from Lauren Milne.

## Code.org-øvingar utan lyd

The [Code.org tutorials](https://studio.code.org/courses) can all be used with or without sound. All the videos have captions.

## Parprogrammering

Pair programming is a tool computer scientists use to solve problems as a pair or team. Try working on Hour of Code challenges with a friend or classmate. Don’t forget to [check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q) to learn the best techniques for pair programming.
