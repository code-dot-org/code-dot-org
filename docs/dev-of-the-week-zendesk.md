# IN ZENDESK

1. Go to Zendesk: [codeorg.zendesk.com](http://codeorg.zendesk.com/) (If you don't have a personal log-in ask Melissa for one, or use dev@code.org log in)
 - If the single sign on doesn't work, you might need to use [support.code.org/access/normal](https://support.code.org/access/normal/) to log in to your Zendesk account.

2. On the left hand side, click the second icon "Views" and then choose "Unassigned Developer Tickets"

 - **For new tickets:** Try reproing and identify if we have enough information to fix the issue. 

    *A. If we do:* create a pivotal item for it (see steps below) and then in Zendesk use the macro "Thanks for the bug report" Mark as solved.
  
    *B. If we don't:* Ask them for any follow-up information and mark as Pending. (Use the "Send me what OS and browser you're using" Macro if you want.) Or assign it to a specific developer who knows what follow-up information to ask for.

 - **For open or pending tickets:** See if the requester has responded with follow-up information. If they have, follow steps [A] or [B] above. If a requester hasn't responded back to us in over 7 days, use the "User Response Time > 7 Days" macro and mark as solved.

3. Choose the "Stale Developer Tickets" view

 - **For pending tickets:** Use the "User Response Time > 7 Days" macro and solve the ticket

 - **For new or open tickets:** Tag the assignee in Zendesk room so that they respond and/or close it themselves
