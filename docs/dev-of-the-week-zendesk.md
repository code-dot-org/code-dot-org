# IN ZENDESK

1. Go to Zendesk: codeorg.zendesk.com (If you don't have a personal log-in ask Katie for one, or use dev@code.org log in)
 - If the single sign on doesn't work, you might need to use [support.code.org/access/normal](https://support.code.org/access/normal/) to log in to your Zendesk account.

2. On the left hand side, click the second icon "Views" and then choose "Unassigned Developer Tickets"

 - **For new tickets:** Try reproing and identify if we have enough information to fix the issue. 

    *A. If we do:* create a pivotal item for it (see steps below) and then in Zendesk use the macro "Thanks for the bug report" Mark as solved.
  
    *B. If we don't:* Ask them for any follow-up information and mark as Pending. (Use the "Send me what OS and browser you're using" Macro if you want.) Or assign it to a specific developer who knows what follow-up information to ask for.

 - **For open or pending tickets:** See if the requester has responded with follow-up information. If they have, follow steps [A] or [B] above. If a requester hasn't responded back to us in over 7 days, use the "User Response Time > 7 Days" macro and mark as solved.

# IN PIVOTAL

1. Open the zendesk column (more --> Zendesk or "Zendesk" in the left-hand nav)

2. Click the refresh button in the title of the zendesk column to make sure you have the most up to date list

3. For each item:
  1. drag to icebox
  2. tag appropriately (e.g. course1/2/3, account management)
  3. Assign to Mona and
    - Brent: blockly code bugs
    - Brendan: UI issue
    - Laurel: Teacher Dashboard or login issues
    - Dave: Mobile/tablet bugs
    - Mona: things that are not bugs but are useful feedback (eg. I am confused about the long and short line drop down in K-1 blocks)
