# How to update level builder

## To update levelbuilder to match staging:

1. On GitHub, open a pull request from `staging` into `levelbuilder`, link: [levelbuilder...staging](https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org/compare/levelbuilder...staging?expand=1)
  1. Or in your local repository:
    - `git checkout levelbuilder`
    - `git pull origin levelbuilder` To make sure you're up-to-date.
    - `git pull origin staging` To fetch and merge `staging` directly into `levelbuilder`.
    - You'll likely get "both modified" merge conflicts in `dashboard/public/apps-package/*`, `blockly-core/build_output/blockly_compressed.js` and `blockly-core/build_output/blockly_uncompressed.js`. We don't need staging's copies of these build products - they're out of date and about to be rebuilt anyway, so do:
      1. `git checkout --ours blockly-core/build_output/blockly_compressed.js blockly-core/build_output/blockly_uncompressed.js`
      1. `git add blockly-core/build_output/blockly_compressed.js blockly-core/build_output/blockly_uncompressed.js`
      1. `git checkout --ours dashboard/public/apps-package`
      1. `git add dashboard/public/apps-package`
      1. Fix remaining merge conficts, if any.
      1. `git commit`
    - `git push`
1. Wait for levelbuilder to deploy.

## To commit changes from levelbuilder into staging:

1. Integrate `staging` into `levebuilder` as described above; wait for levelbuilder finish deploying.
1. `ssh levelbuilder-staging` from gateway
1. `cd levelbuilder`
1. `git branch` **If it doesn't say `levelbuilder` get the dev-of-the-week and/or Will.**
1. `git add --all dashboard`
1. `git commit -m "levelbuilder changes committed by YOUR NAME HERE"`
1. `git push`
1. On GitHub, open a pull request from `levelbuilder` into `staging`. link: https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org/compare/staging...levelbuilder
2. Click the "Merge pull request" button and watch the "Staging" room in Hipchat to make sure the build succeeds. If anything breaks, see the "Did it break section" below. 

# Did it break?

## Open issues and workarounds:

- Updating English-language strings from .script file doesn't automatically update localized strings ([#82514628](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/82514628)). Workarounds:
 1. After updating the description in the .script file, delete the entry for the script in scripts.en.yml, then run rake seed:scripts (or rake seed:all.
 1. Modify the entry in scripts.en.yml directly to update description text (you don't even need to modify the text in the .script file).
- Renaming a level in LB keeps the old .level file around ([#78597388](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/78597388)). Workaround: Manually delete the old level after rename.

## Record not found

Did you get an error message like:

````
ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound: ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound, Level: {"name":"Course 4 Maze 1","stage":"Maze and Bee","concept_ids":null}, Script: course4
````

If so, one of two things might have happened:

### .seeded file is out of sync

Levelbuilder and staging only reseed scripts when script files have
changed since the last time rake:seed was run. It keeps track of this
using the .seeded file, but if a git pull was happening at the same
time as a rake:seed the date could be wrong.

To fix:

````
> cd dashboard
> rm config/scripts/.seeded
> rake seed:all
````

### you get a merge conflict with `dashboard/config/locales/dsls.en.yml`

This file is owned by levelbuilder, but can be (incorrectly) modified by
the staging build process. If you experience a merge conflict, resolve it
in favor of levelbuilder.

### you just pulled .level and .script files that were created by a different levelbuilder

Levelbuilders by default do not read levels from files into the
database. If you just pulled files from git that were created by a
different levelbuilder environment, you need to force it to read in
those new levels or they will be missing:

To fix:

````
> cd dashboard
> rake seed:all FORCE_CUSTOM_LEVELS=1
````

If you also need to rebuild levelbuilder:
````
> cd ..
> touch build-started
````

(you may have to remove the .seeded file as above also).

## Master failed to start, check stderr log for details?

Getting an error like:

```
RAILS_ENV=levelbuilder RACK_ENV=levelbuilder bundle exec rake assets:precompile
sudo service levelbuilder start
master failed to start, check stderr log for details
rake aborted!
'sudo service levelbuilder start' returned 1
/home/ubuntu/levelbuilder/lib/cdo/rake_utils.rb:33:in `system'
```

View the contents of `levelbuilder/dashboard/log/unicorn_stderr.log`.

### Already running?

Does `unicorn_stderr.log` then say have something like `/var/lib/gems/2.0.0/gems/unicorn-4.8.2/lib/unicorn/http_server.rb:206:in 'pid=': Already running on PID:9070 (or pid=/home/ubuntu/levelbuilder/dashboard/config/unicorn.rb.pid is stale) (ArgumentError)`?

Try restarting unicorn:

1. `kill -9 9070` (or whichever `PID` showed up above)
1. `rake build:dashboard`
