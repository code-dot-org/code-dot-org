# Writing UI tests with Applitools Eyes

Applitools Eyes is a service that lets us upload and compare screenshots of our site over time.

## Getting an account

Code.org employees as of this writing should receive login details for a shared account. If not, contact Brian about getting an account.

## Add your feature to the eyes file

Either add your test to `/dashboard/test/ui/features/eyes.feature`

OR

add your test to a new `.feature` file, annotating it with `@eyes`

If you need to write an eyes test that is specific to a mobile device, make sure
it is annotated with `@eyes_mobile` and not `@eyes`.  By default, `@eyes` tests
will only run against Chrome 33 and `@eyes_mobile` tests will only run against
iPhone.

## Run the test

To run locally, you must have the Applitools secret key installed in your `locals.yml`.

```yaml
# code-dot-org/locals.yml
applitools_eyes_api_key: 'my_applitools_eyes_key'
```

You can find that key by [logging in](https://eyes.applitools.com/app/sessions/) and pressing (Profile Icon) -> My API Key.

### Try it locally

1. `./runner.rb -m -l --eyes` (running Chromedriver)
  1. Toggle ONLY running @eyes annotated tests with `--eyes`
  1. Usually the first test run will fail due to there being no baseline yet. In `error.log` you can see the exact error which usually includes a link to the session
1. Visit the [Applitools sessions dashboard](https://eyes.applitools.com/app/sessions/) to see your test run
  1. **Accept** the changes and **Save** (bottom right)

### Try it targeting Sauce Labs

1. `bundle exec ./runner.rb --eyes -c Chrome33Win7,iPhone`

## Watch for run on next deploy

In `aws/build.rake`, as part of the test.code.org CI script, the eyes tests will
be run (as of writing, currently only against the Chrome 33 browser and iPhone).

Results are reported to HipChat.
